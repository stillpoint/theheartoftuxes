  <h1>Can someone help me understand this aspect of Buddhism?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Will my elder self be happier knowing I have led a compassionate Buddhist life or will I be sorrowful knowing I had noone to share my life with and for having no kid to share my knowledge?</em></p>
<p>We don't know. Nobody knows what you will feel or think or be in the future. But there are a few things we <em>do</em> know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This future is unreal. It is only imagining that is happening right now. The future that will happen has not yet happened; it is not here. What is real is here and now. <em>This</em> is your real life, <em>this</em> is where you can make a difference in your happiness and the happiness of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things are changeable; all things are subject to birth and death: they appear through the combined movement of other things, they last for a while depending on circumstances, and then they disappear into the combined movement of other things. So what we know about the future is that it will always be changing, that there will always be ups and downs, and that your happiness does not (and <em>can</em> not) depend on any of those changeable things. Your happiness doesn't come from a possession or event or relationship or form of lifestyle; it comes from within you. Certain relationships and actions and lifestyle choices can help it to emerge, but the happiness is the nature of your original mind and doesn't depend on anything outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future, no matter where you are and who you are with there will still be opportunity for dissatisfaction, loneliness, unsureness, as well as opportunity to move toward mutual care, connection, completion, independence, and contentment. The direction you move in, though, is only ever expressed in the present moment. You can make happy choices now; and in the future now you can also make happy choices. String those now moments together, and you have a life of happy choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am in a similar situation to yours. My family and cultural upbringing made it difficult for me to sense my own way and follow it. It has been a long road to self-acknowledgement and self-care. But that's okay. Life is only this moment, so life is very easy if you are not thinking about past and future. Decades of problems are very difficult to overturn; handling a month's worth of tasks is too burdensome; even sometimes an hour or a few minutes of pain are too much to handle. But a moment has no duration; it is very easy. So we focus on this easy moment — we focus on having our correct relationship just now, just now, just now.</p>
<p>Whether you are facing someone just now or whether you are "alone", you always have the relationship with the moment. What is your correct way just now? When hungry, you eat. When it's time to go to work, you go to work. When someone else is hungry, you feed them. When someone else is in pain, you comfort them. Each moment has its correct relationship, and by attending to the moment clearly your own true way will unfold.</p>
<p>Your own true way doesn't appear from your thinking. It's not something you figure out. It is far greater and far more subtle than your thinking can grasp. Your own true way unfolds by itself if you get out of the way. So you need to make consistent effort to let go of your old patterns of thinking and relating, and return to the moment cleanly and openly. When reading a book, just read the book. When walking, be complete in your walking — let go of doubt, hesitation, and wandering mind. This is a profound, life-long practice; but if you want happiness to appear through your life you have to dismantle the prison of mind that has been built up.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...love is for a girl to love me back.</em></p>
<p>This is an important point. What you are talking about is yearning, desiring, clinging, seeking, hoping, wanting. This is not love. Of course, many romantic songs and movies and stories will say differently; but I am telling you now: this is not love. You can't <em>get</em> love, you can only <em>be</em> love. Like happiness, love is the nature of your original mind. If you get rid of the things that are in the way, your original mind shines love to everyone. It radiates like a lantern, outward from the center of who you are. So when you notice yourself seeking or wanting something from outside, you will know "Oh, this is not love."</p>
<p>What we seek when we seek anything in life — satisfaction from a relationship, from possessions, from fame, from recognition at work, from a sense of safety at home — what we really seek from any of these is <em>ourself</em>. We are looking for our own completion. We are just often misguided about where to find that completion. We make the mistake of looking for it "out there", but it is not out there.</p>
<p>In fact, our completion is not to be sought anywhere, because we have never lost it. We just <em>think</em> we have lost it. It's like the story in the Bible where a man is wandering around thinking he is poor and helpless, but all the time he has a tremendously precious and valuable jewel sewn into the hem of his coat. He's traveling around thinking he's poor, but in reality he's rich.</p>
<p>This is our situation. We only assume that this life, this moment, is not enough; so we go looking for completion in other things, other people. But originally, this moment is enough. We are enough. All of life is enough, as-is. We just need more practice at being enough. So we may undertake the practice of meditation, which accepts and looks into the nature of the moment as-it-is. We sit open-handed, neither moving toward nor away from anything, neither grasping nor resisting, allowing our "enough" to appear and become stronger.</p>
<p>This moment is enough, and this one is enough. This situation is enough, and that one will be enough. Being with you is enough, and being on our own is enough. Family life is enough, and monk life is enough. Each thing is complete already. Only your mind makes something incomplete.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Be clear in the moment, and your life will unfold correctly. It is not for you to decide ahead of time what life should be.</p>
