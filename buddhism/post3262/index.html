  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Many of us, especially online, have this common practice sickness: we want to know what's going to happen before we even try something. I have to bow to the tremendous patience of teachers, especially teachers from old traditions and cultures where practitioners have generally thrown themselves into practice with strong faith. Our timid, entitled, lazy, picking-and-choosing attitudes would be so tiresome and distasteful to teachers if they lacked great wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>&gt;The way it works is, you do the thing you're scared shitless of, and you get the courage <em>after</em> you do it, not before you do it.  <br />
– Archie Gates, in <em>Three Kings</em> (1999)</p>
<p>The way it works in practice is you do the practice, then you understand it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>What do you eat for breakfast? Why that and not something else?</p>
<p>You've had some conditioning, received some knowledge, and have figured a range of options that work for you.</p>
<p>Some people have eggs every morning; others have cereal. Some have vegetable soup and rice for breakfast; others do with coffee and toast. Different styles for different people, often based on their conditioning — following the way their parents and families do it, or other people they've lived with.</p>
<p>You <em>continue</em> to eat a certain breakfast, why? Maybe you find it pleasant and sufficient in your own experience. Maybe you do some research on what's healthy. Maybe an expert like a doctor or nutritionist gives you a list of good and bad foods.</p>
<p>There are many different styles; but the main thing is getting the food into your belly.</p>
<p>Likewise, there are many different styles of training and many good practices. The main thing is whether they help you to become clear, present, and kind, and whether they help you wake up.</p>
<p>So many people fixate on form; but that's really a way of shirking their own responsibility. Maybe they don't know it yet, but brooding and stressing about 'the right practice for me' puts the focus in the wrong place. What's important is your direction and your activity. If your intent is to help all beings with your own clarity, then any number of practices and teachers will be of benefit to you. In any case, the way it unfolds will depend greatly on your karma: despite your decisions and the illusion of steering your life, things will go according to the actions and connections you've made in this life and past lives.</p>
<p>It's when your direction is unclear that stress and confusion enter practice. When you try to get your favorite situation, or when you imagine yourself as a special case requiring special treatment, <em>no</em> situation will be sufficient for you. You will always check, check, check.</p>
<p>But if you truly align with compassion for others, and the aspiration to wake up not just to get your own comfort but <em>because the world desperately needs your help</em>, then you can go decisively into practice.</p>
<p>Choose one. Learn well. Do it. Talk to your teachers and senior practice brothers and sisters about doubts and problems. Soon enough you'll find whether there is good reason to change.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>For high-level capacity, high-level practice is appropriate. But for those who don't have high-level capacity, high-level practice becomes low-level practice; they can't carry it out. This means there is no high or low level, there is just what's appropriate for certain practitioners in certain situations.</p>
<p>Some practices are very broad, and suitable for a great many people. Other practices aim at challenges that some, but not all, may face. And yet other practices take advantage of special constitutions or abilities: some people may do better with body-based practice; others have more devotional nature; others are more intellectual; and so on.</p>
<p>In the old days, life was more simple and many people were more clear. A lot of aspects of life are quite similar or the same; but I think we can see that our modern society has a lot of difficulty with disconnection, complexity, distraction, anxiety, and similar modern mind-sicknesses. So certain practices that were aimed at relatively disconnected or distracted minds are now quite apropos for many people. 'Noting' is one such practice. It provides another layer of structure to help bring about stability and equanimity. And by the same token, it is not harmful if practiced by someone who doesn't exactly need it (though people are often poor judges of the practice they need — that's why a clear-eyed teacher is important).</p>
<p>If you don't yet believe in noting practice, you probably need more teaching and practice, so you can understand and see for yourself the cause-and-effect connection between the practice and the goal. So many of these kinds of 'issues' are solved by shutting up and just doing it. Then either you find what opinions and habits you need to let go of, or you find that the practice is not for you (along with a lot of other very good information, such as <em>why</em>, and who it <em>is</em> good for, and what's really important to you, and so on).</p>
<p>Also, as you progress, you may find that your previous narrow and superior views soften and become broader and more humble. You may begin to accept the validity of other paths, and even begin to see their brilliance. I mean, <em>hopefully</em> this will happen, rather than continuing in sort of chauvinist attachment to one school or method. All Buddhist vehicles lead to enlightenment, and all are complete in themselves.</p>
