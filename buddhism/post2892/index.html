  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I like your thoughtful and flowing style.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>everything we hear and perceive is or was affected by something, there is no such thing as something that hasnt been affected by something else. every action has a reaction. so why does it matter what you choose to include or exclude in meditation?</em></p>
<p>What is the purpose of meditation?</p>
<p>If there is a purpose, there are specific conditions that lead to that end.</p>
<p>For some, the purpose is (at least in part) to move beyond endless cycles of reactivity, and to attain the Absolute. Moving beyond our deep-set habits and reactions is incredibly rigorous; therefore many instructions appeared about how to use environment and activity to help in that process, that practice.</p>
<p>Left to our own devices, we inevitably follow our own narrow way. We stick to what we know; we embrace what we're comfortable with and we shun what we're uncomfortable with; we cling to pleasure and run away from displeasure and ignore what's neutral. We prefer our own ideas and the knowledge that we already have, over knowledge that shakes is up and overturns our world. This only perpetuates our long-standing patterns; we never move on from our own little circle. Or if we move on a little, soon we fall back.</p>
<p>So people who <em>have</em> done the hard work and <em>have</em> moved beyond their self-centered habits and reactivity kindly show us the way. They leave guidelines and lead us step by step so we can find that way ourselves. The instructions are not for them, to somehow glorify them; they are for our liberation, so we can be free of our ancient habits -- so our thought-made world no longer controls us, and we are no longer pulled around by like and dislike, like marionettes on strings.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...a matter of... how our attachments affect us?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it's a matter of how our attachments affect us, controlling our speech and action and thought, and even controlling the way we see (or don't see) reality.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Why do the majority of people choose to include silence when meditating? because it is less distracting? where did that idea come from?</em></p>
<p>At the start, many of us don't even understand what attention is. We may not even perceive our own states of distraction and non-distraction. We may think we are experiencing non-distraction simply because one object has captivated us. This can actually be a good thing to realize.</p>
<p>For instance, when you go to see a good movie, you disappear. You become one with the action in the movie, experiencing the life portrayed in the film. Later, you come out of the experience and there's a sort of magical realization that you were transported in oneness for a time and now have returned to your separate sense of self. So for a time, your mind was taken away. But the movie did it.</p>
<p>That is essentially the process of meditation; but in meditation, <em>you</em> do it. You let go of the thinking, moving, making mind and return to original oneness. It's just that you no longer need an external situation to do it for you.</p>
<p>If the only way to let go and reset were to see a movie or watch TV or listen to music, we'd be in trouble. And for a lot of people this is true: they only rely on external things to take their problematic mind away. Their ability to reset is very limited. True meditation means you become completely independent, not relying on any external situation to take your mind away.</p>
<p>Now, some methods do rely on an external object. They use one object to remove all other objects. So one might listen to bell sound, or to sound in general, and using the suggested method let go of the moving mind. Or other objects may be used. And then some meditations don't use any object at all. Usually beginners find these meditations more difficult, because they have not yet learned how to avoid attaching to objects.</p>
<p>Whether one object is used or no object is used, certain conditions have been found to help maintain attention. For example, most people find that one of the most distracting kinds of sound is human whispering. The mind quickly and habitually seeks out the language in the whispered sound. TV and radio or live conversation also tend to draw the attention away from meditation. Visually, it's difficult to see word shapes without moving the mind to read them.</p>
<p>One teacher had his intermediate students sit in meditation while watching television. This is a very interesting experiment. Can one remain non-attached, can one's mind be unmoved by words and images? It would be a useful skill in this electronic age.</p>
<p>When you become more familiar with your own silent nature you may begin to love it and embody it. The need to seek out new techniques and different states will diminish. Questions about sound or no sound won't matter. The source of profound silence within will be like the clearest, most refreshing mountain spring. The world of forms -- sights and sounds, concepts and moods, physical and mental events -- will all pale in comparison.</p>
<p><em>That</em> silence, when the mind is not moving, is very important. One may say it is the most important thing in life.</p>
<p>External silence may be maintained in order to facilitate the internal silence. But as we've noted it is not strictly necessary if one's concentration is strong.</p>
