  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>I want to understand</em></p>
<p>This is the first mistake. The thought that you are missing something, and the desperation to fill in that perceived vacancy keeps you playing the role of a small, deficient self. Instead, you ought to practice being what you really are: complete, noble, free. Take care with the "I want" that produces an ego character, the ego character of the 'seeker'. Practical experience is far, far, far more valuable.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I would really like to understand the teachings to the fullest</em></p>
<p>If this is the case, you have to put yourself on the line; you have to <em>do</em> something about it, not only read.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous misconception about the role of thought and study in spiritual transformation. People who can't imagine any other world besides the world of thought believe that the key to their fulfillment and happiness lies in gaining <em>data</em>: "If I can only gain enough <em>knowledge</em>, I'll be able to change myself." That is not the way.</p>
<p>Actually, it is the other way around. If only you were willing to <em>let go</em> of knowledge, you could transform. It means putting yourself into the hands of something beyond your own ego, beyond your own grasping, manipulating, figuring mind. Feeding that mind with more material will not help you.</p>
<p>Letting go of thought and knowledge doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't have it. Of course, knowledge is necessary. Right view is the first step on the Noble Eightfold Path: you have to know the situation to some degree before you can take other right steps toward awakening. But you should not think that books have the answer for you. There is no answer there. There is no answer anywhere. The source of wisdom is empty, open, spacious. You have to be willing to step into Unknowing, to crack and loosen and fall apart so you can become something new, to merge with the boundlessness you seek.</p>
<p>There are many good paths. All branches of Buddhism have produced enlightened beings as well as countless sincere, happy, good-hearted people. There are also many shallow or negative paths; but anyway there are many good ones to choose from.</p>
<p>There are also many good teachers. If you find an awakened teacher, it is incredibly precious, regardless of the method they teach or the tradition they're involved in. A good student develops flexibility of mind. At first it is good to train in one lineage and one method, to learn it deeply, to develop the practice habit, to steep in the nuances that cannot possibly be conveyed by mere words or in brief encounters. But eventually the student develops a solid base of practice, a faith in her/himself that allows them to enter all different kinds of situations freely. For instance, many monks challenge themselves to enter practice situations <em>outside</em> of their home practice — different teacher, different method, different customs. They become like beginners again; but because their minds are already very stable through practice, it is no problem.</p>
<p>It is this kind of willingness to be shaped that you should take to heart. Go to a teacher, research a lineage or practice group and dip your toes in the water. Start getting actual experience of practice, actual experience that leads you to your own original mind. Don't invest in concepts!</p>
<p>This is the foremost issue for you. The priority between practice and book-learning has to be right. Many people get it wrong, and it cuts off their path before they even start. They think that by gaining more knowledge they have got something real, but they do not. When push comes to shove in life, it cannot help them. It cannot help you. You have to come to your own original mind.</p>
<p>If this priority is correct, <em>then</em> study can be of use. It can help you organize your cognition, distinguish between various routes, and perhaps may provide some springboard for certain practices. But the meat of your life should be <em>doing</em> practice, not reading about it.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>One time seeing is better than a thousand times reading.</strong></p>
<p>Self-investigation means facing your mind, not a book. <em>Do not</em> equate self-investigation with study of words! You want to go deeper; this is very important. Books will not carry you deeper. You have to <em>do it!</em> Put yourself on the line, put yourself into a practice situation, and allow yourself to be molded by wisdom. Don't cling to possessions or states or knowledges, as you have always done.</p>
<p>The great Zen Master Ta Hui, eminent master from the Golden Age of Zen, speaks to you directly:</p>
<p>&gt; As soon as you rely on the slightest knowledge,  <br />
&gt; you miss the scene where you're standing.  <br />
&gt; When you've comprehended the scene  <br />
&gt; right where you are,  <br />
&gt; then all kinds of knowledge —  <br />
&gt; all without exception —  <br />
&gt; are things right where you are.</p>
