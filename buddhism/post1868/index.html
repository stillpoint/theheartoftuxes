  <h1>How to counsel others going through tough times when they are determined to be angry about something they don't have to be?</h1>

<p>For one thing, you need to separate your needs from hers. If <em>you</em> need her to feel differently, talk differently, or be different around you, then you have to check with yourself: do <em>you</em> need to let go? It may mean spending less time together, or it may require you to make some requests or set some boundaries. But if so, you need to own your own discomfort and impatience, and not foist them on your friend.</p>
<p>You have every right to expect and request a certain baseline of right intention. If you are being dragged down by bitterness, redundant arguments, gossip, and so on, you can request that your friend not visit those negative energies upon you. If need be, you can let your friend know what you <em>are</em> up for: "I'm okay for you to vent <em>one time</em> for five minutes; but after that, I'm going to ask you to be with me in the present situation and enjoy our time together. You can also kindly admit what you're finding difficult to bear, and ask for understanding if you need to take a bit more space; you're not going away for good, you're just getting some breathing room.</p>
<p>If you are too frustrated or impatient with your friend, it may also be time to generate more compassion. Listen. Listen completely. Listen so completely that you can feel yourself in your friend's place and see what she sees from her viewpoint. You may even come around physically to face the same direction she is facing, and speak as her, asking her to correct you if your account of her situation and viewpoint are mistaken. <em>Then</em>, once you've completely heard and seen things from your friend's perspective, likely there will be some movement; either you will find a new way of relating, or your friend will finally feel heard (not preached to), or perhaps both — the heart to heart connection will be more open.</p>
<p>So that is one side: Do you need more space or clear boundaries so that you aren't pulled down by toxic attitudes? Or do you need to listen compassionately, unconditionally, with your whole being?</p>
<p>The other side is for your friend to own. Different people grieve in different ways and 'get over it' at different paces. You can make the offer of perspective or advice, but it's rare that a person bent on feeling bitter will want to open up to possibilities others might put forth. At some level, she knows she's holding onto pain. She just doesn't care to leave the pain right now. Pain may feel more comforting that open possibility. So you can make the offer, but if your friend doesn't want it, don't give it.</p>
<p>Everyone has to take care of their own karma. Sometimes the window is closed, and no good teaching or blessing can come in. The person has shut the window themselves, or their karma — their mind habit — has clouded them. You can either be there with her and practice your own stabilization of mind, to be a present, even-minded example and influence; or you can leave her to her own situation until the window opens, until she wakes up and sees that she doesn't want to harm herself any more.</p>
<p>In many cases, people have to suffer some more before they wake up. In many cases, that's the only thing that will start to open them up: more suffering. In fact, people get so comfortable with their suffering that their resistance to opening becomes a pattern itself. Your friend may actually rely on you to be the positive one, so that she can resist and feel shitty. You don't need to get stuck in that role. (Maybe sometimes you can be the negative, shitty-feeling one, and then maybe your friend will not be the only one holding that part.)</p>
<p>I have a friend who is very clear about other people's crap. It is amazing to see, and a great teaching. She will listen and respond compassionately if someone is suffering, but as soon as self-harm, addiction, defeatism, untruth, or other petty and negative dynamics appear, she sets an instant boundary: "Look, if you're going to continue that, I'm out of here. It's up to you. I'm here for you if you want, but don't expect me to carry your crap." Just so you know it's both possible and worthwhile to honor your own clarity and positivity.</p>
<p>People don't really respond to talk very much. They respond to action and energy. If you stand up for your own integrity, that gives a clear example of what you value. You don't have to explain; it becomes obvious what your priorities are. So if you keep your own heart and mind clear — if you do moment to moment mindfulness practice — it can help your friend.</p>
