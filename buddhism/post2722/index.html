  <h1>Final cessation vs "Nirvana in this life"</h1>

<p>Please refer back to my previous comment.</p>
<p>Nirvana is just a word, just an idea, used to point to something that is not a thing, not an object.</p>
<p>Rather than speak in theoretical terms about things we don't know, let's look at what we do know or can know. We can see that our lives are always up and down; nothing satisfies us completely and finally, but instead we find disappointment and stress and a sense of incompletion in every experience. Even our most wonderful experiences soon pass, and we're left with gut-wrenching nostalgia and emptiness. We win, we lose, we win, we lose. And we seem to be struggling among all others who are winning and losing, driven by the same desperation to survive and to fill the emptiness.</p>
<p>This is our shared situation. If one thinks it <em>isn't</em> one's true situation, that is denial. People can avoid seeing the innate unsatisfactoriness of life if they have the resources to distract themselves and the will to pursue distraction. They can build comfy-cozy enclaves, surround themselves with lovely objects and pretty people, eat organic and take antioxidants and use expensive skin creams; but all this just delays the inevitable: the realization that gain and loss are intertwined, and that everything dies.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist cosmology, one of the great continents is called "Sound Of Terror". We are said to be in the Southern Continent, "Dzambu", which is the sound of a particular fruit dropping into the water. Sound Of Terror is in the North. The beings that live in Sound Of Terror are said to be giants; they live for a thousand years and never have to work for sustenance. Their lives are very happy and easy, century after century. But one week before the end of their long life a voice appears, telling them they will die. This voice is the "sound of terror". Very quickly, the dying being grows old and weak. They smell terrible and have a wilting effect on everything around them. Others avoid them, leaving them to die in solitary terror. It is said that the dying being suffers a whole lifetime in that one week.</p>
<p>We can recognize "sound of terror" in our own lives. We ignore, we put off, we deny, we self-distract. We chase trivial things and get caught up in nonsense. We're always trading up: looking for better, more pleasurable food, schedule, people, situations. And sometimes life goes very easily as we ride the crest of the wave. At that time we can live as if we are in control of everything and as if we will live forever (or as if our good situation will never leave). But soon the wave dies down and we sink into the ocean. The sound of terror appears, letting us know that our time is up — "the writing is on the wall" about our excellent living situation or bank account or relationship or work placement. Or sometimes it really hits home and the sound of terror tells us that we have a terminal illness, or otherwise have not much longer to live.</p>
<p>This is our situation.</p>
<p>Next, we can know that cause-and-effect holds true at all times. We can't avoid the results of what we have and haven't done. As everything is stripped from us by time, change, and death, there is nothing more that we can cling to or rely upon. No possessions, no loved ones, no talents, no concepts will be there to help us. We will only have the attainment of our spiritual practice, stark and bare. Small attaiment, small benefit; great attainment, great benefit.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson said that some day we all sit down to a banquet of consequences. This is also our situation.</p>
<p>The cause-and-effect of this insufficient, suffering existence has been continuing lifetime after lifetime. Even if we don't yet understand about previous lifetimes, we can see that it has been continuing on and on throughout this lifetime, and that death is imminent and inevitable.</p>
<p>Taking this all to heart, facing it honestly, we will certainly have a tremendous and urgent aspiration to go beyond the suffering, to finally do away with the never-ending rise and fall and the constant emptiness we experience behind everything. That doing-away with suffering is <em>called</em> Nirvana. It is the name given to the actual going beyond coming-and-going.</p>
<p>So it is not that you <em>should</em> think of Nirvana as a supreme goal. It's not a moral standard, as if you're bad if you don't think a certain way. There's just a cause and effect relationship to life: you either make the causes for suffering or you make the causes for going beyond suffering, and it is completely your choice, whichever of the two you opt for.</p>
<p>Most people avoid looking deeply and honestly at life, so their suffering situation continues. Of those who do look deeply and honestly, who then have the proper confluence of conditions to do something about it?: sufficient physical and intellectual faculties, sufficient leisure (time and political/religious freedom), contact with correct teaching, access to a good teacher, and motivation to follow the path. How many of these conditions are you fortunate enough to have already? Are you willing to do what it takes to bring about the others?</p>
