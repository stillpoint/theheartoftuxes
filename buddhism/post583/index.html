  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; Buddha said to base everything on our experience, don't believe in anything anyone says.</p>
<p>That's not so. It's a gross dumbing-down of a point from a previously little-known sutra (Kalama Sutta) that was popularized in recent years to support <em>unnecessarily</em> skeptical views.</p>
<p>What the Buddha actually said was that we should be reasonable in our approach, not take things based <em>solely</em> on authority; but that when we encounter a source of true wisdom and good teaching, we should take it to heart. That is, neither blind faith nor blind skepticism is helpful.</p>
<p>Verify teachings within your own deep and consistent practice, but don't dismiss teachings just because you don't yet understand them.</p>
<p>As to realms and beings, these are all formations of original substance, which is <em>sunyata</em>, which is mind. All beings and realms are ultimately projections of mind, all come from the same source, all have the same base of conditioned existence.</p>
<p>But some of these formations are more pure, less gross. I think it was Heraclitus who said that physical existence is pretty much the least real thing possible. So we might at least consider the possibility that this realm that we habitually think of as the <em>only</em> reality is actually the thinnest, merest, most 'surface' realm; and that we only experience it as the sole reality because of our own clumsy, obscured perception.</p>
<p>Even among common people, we have all met some who can perceive more subtly and some who are very vulgar in their perception. (Check the current US presidential race, for example.) It's not that the dull, vulgar ones can see with refinement but choose not to; their experience of the world is conditioned by the way they see it. If the mind makes an enemy of everything, one lives in a world of enemies.</p>
<p>On the flip side, surely we all know people who seem 'a cut above' â€” people who seem to be able to cleave through the debris and see their way through life more quickly and easily than we can, or who can read others well, or who possess unusual creative talent. A chef may have an exceptionally refined palate; an artist may have an exceptional ability to envision structures of hope or empathize through forms of suffering; a person deeply in love may feel their lover's mind and heart intimately. Even among common people, there are those whose perception is more refined.</p>
<p>Take this difference another step, and consider the difference between a beginner to spiritual practice or someone who has merely dabbled with on-again, off-again practice for many years, versus someone who has kept clear mind and clear precepts day by day, month by month, year by year for much of their life. Just being able to keep pure practice for a few moments or a few days may seem miraculous to those of us who struggle! How much more miraculous to keep it unendingly. The difference in perception between low-class and high-class practitioner is very apparent! Sometimes it may seem that the advanced practitioner has special powers of foresight or clairvoyance. It seems that way because of their significantly greater refinement of perception.</p>
<p>Take another step yet, and consider by extension that there are very attained beings who have had the benefit of exceptional capacity and exceptional teaching, who have gained great enlightenment and have continued refining it, for decades, for lifetimes, and perhaps for eons. If just among people we meet every day there are significant differences in perception, how much more so â€” <em>inconceivably</em> so â€” in the case of great attained beings? We can't say what they see. We can only (reasonably) suspend disbelief when they report.</p>
<p>After all, if these beings have devoted themselves to truth, sincerity, and selfless compassion so much more than we have, why should we not offer at least some openminded trust in what they pass on? They are not doing it for themselves, but for others.</p>
<p>This of course begs the question, "What if someone is just <em>posing</em> as a sincere, attained being?" And that is where <em>appropriate</em>, measured skepticism, testing, research, practice, and verification come in. If you don't attach to 'shiny objects', trying to get special powers and nice situations for yourself, you will not be swayed by empty promises.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that if <em>your</em> perception is dull and self-centered, you will not see much beyond your own narrow-mindedness. It's the case of the frog who lived his whole life in a well, and when a rabbit came to the edge of the well to talk of the world beyond, the frog scoffed: "Pssht! All that exists is this darkness and a small circle of light above. Don't give me that crap about 'landscapes' as far as the eye can see."</p>
<p>As you get some actual experience in meditation, you will start to open to the understanding of how the outer world is created by mind. As you get some actual experience with greater beings â€” advanced practitioners and masters â€” you will start to get an inkling of how far you have to go, and how far some others have already gone.</p>
<p>It's not necessary to believe without questioning. And it's not necessary to question simply because of discomfort with what lies beyond one's current ignorance. In this, too, the Middle Way is essential.</p>
