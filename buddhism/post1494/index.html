  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Yes, this is the same Om as in the Hindu mantras. One Om, universal.</p>
<p>Only the way Hindus and Buddhists use Om is a bit different. Often Hindu mantras will end with Om, merging with the universal. But often Buddhist mantras <em>start</em> at the universal, and then find specific expression or function; so only merging is not the end, it is significant how that merging functions in everyday life, in relationship, at work, etc.</p>
<p>This distinction doesn't always hold true, but it's somewhat the case.</p>
<p>You say that you have no idea how a mantra works; but that is not true. You already have some knowledge. You say that you sensed a reverberation of sound, that you found it in the body, and that you experienced it as relaxing and pleasant. So that is already some knowledge.</p>
<p>Also, you have heard and repeated "ahh", "ohh", and "hmm", as well as "om". These are all already knowledge. More than four kinds of knowledge you already have!</p>
<p>They are just not <em>ideas</em>. You have knowledge, but you don't have <em>ideas</em>; and the habit of mind that seeks and clings to ideas feels lacking, and causes you to think that <em>you</em> are lacking. Never mind! If you want to learn more about mantras you can learn with a teacher who uses mantra. Vajrayana is <em>steeped</em> in mantra, especially (but far from exclusively) the higher 'secret mantra' paths of Vajrayana. Zen also employs mantra, dharani (long mantra), and chanting. Then there are schools built around a single mantra (such as the name of the Lotus Sutra "nam myoho renge kyo" in Nichiren Buddhism), schools that chant sutras, schools of yogic internal energy practice that use mantras. There is a tremendous amount of tremendously profound knowledge regarding mantra.</p>
<p>Even the Bible has mantra!</p>
<p>&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  <br />
â€“ John 1:1</p>
<p>This is not different from "Om", the universal creative word. It's just talking <em>about</em> the universal creative word. But there is a recognition that all creation is vibration (which is confirmed by modern sub-atomic physics); there is recognition of an aspect of reality that is all voice, all sound. So voice is one of the areas of training: we awaken through voice, as we also do through the body and through the mind.</p>
<p>What I would recommend <em>against</em> is falling prey to that clinging mind-habit that thinks amassing ideas is somehow valuable or powerful. An idea without proper direction becomes poison. You can soon poison your true knowing with ideas that don't help you. So many people have a lot of thinking-knowledge, about mantra and many other things, and this thinking-knowledge makes them feel as though they have something important, but they can't actually help themselves or others.</p>
<p>So it's not important to have a lot of ideas or thinking-knowledge. A bit of the <em>right</em> knowledge is necessary; and you get that from a teacher, not by random.</p>
<p>There is one attribute shared by people who have achieved great attainment and liberation through mantra; and it's not that they have a lot of theoretical knowledge, not at all. It's that they <em>do</em> it! They do many, many repetitions of the practice, with the faith that they are receiving blessings and purifying their minds. Devoted practitioners do thousands of repetitions of mantra every day, and many of them do <em>continuous</em> mantra â€” undendingly from wake to sleep, and even throughout sleep.</p>
<p>Great practitioners are very often quite simple in their approach and quite single-minded in their devotion. Once they have a practice, they just do it. They don't let doubt and dithering erode it. So from the outside, other people often can't see that a tremendously strong practice is being performed. From the outside, these practitioners seem regular; they just go about their day. But on the inside, they never lose contact. Only mantra, continuously. Their awakening is one continuous stream; and their simplicity helps clean all their relationships and their world.</p>
<p>One woman, a mother, who recently passed away was lauded in Bhutan for her practice and attainment. From the outside she seemed to many to be like just a regular, if very kind and simple, mother. But it is estimated that she had performed some <em>60 million</em> repetitions of mantra in her lifetime. Her mind was always attuned to awakening, and at the end of her life she was recognized as a great practitioner.</p>
<p>But the practice itself is not 60 million. The practice is just one. Just this one... just this one... just this one.... Always momentary, always just now.</p>
