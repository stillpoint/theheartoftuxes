  <h1>Is there a way to be friends with someone without being enticed into doing things you've separated yourself from?</h1>

<p>&gt;What do you do at that point? Withdraw from everything in your life to rest?</p>
<p>That last sentence is loaded. I wonder if you're <em>hoping</em> the answer is to withdraw.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Your question is a perennial question: <strong>how to nurture practice.</strong> It deserves a whole thread, if not a whole subreddit. I'm sure many meditators here will have all kinds of insights to offer. There are many reasons practice falters, so there is no single answer. It's a good question.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>What do you need? There are many reasons practice may falter.</p>
<p>Sometimes there's a depression that requires skillful and compassionate response.</p>
<p>Sometimes one gets overwhelmed by schedule, environment, or relationship; and some kind of change to the appropriate area of life is helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes inconsistency is a pattern that needs to be overcome with a kick in the ass and continued effort.</p>
<p>In general, disappointment comes because of self-centered grasping. If you are in it only for good feeling or to get your own beneficial effects, then as those effects naturally wax and wane so will your energy for practice. So this is the first point: you should have no gaining idea in practice. This is also part of clarifying your direction in life. Why do meditation at all? Why do anything? If it's only for you, you are bound to have disappointment; but if you cultivate a love for others in your heart there will be greater energy available for practice.</p>
<p>Self-centered grasping is usually behind our obstacles in practice. As to how that grasping manifests specifically, that may take some introspection (or objectivity -- a teacher, counselor, coach, or Dharma friend may be able to see what's up for you).</p>
<p>For example, you may experience a malaise, a wounding disappointment about a certain experience at work or in relationship. The incident is the trigger, the precipitating cause; and the wound it creates might be addressed with a very specific skillful response. But the underlying issue, the reason the incident throws you off balance enough to upset your practice, is self-cherishing. Clarifying your direction and incorporating broad compassion into your practice are cures in this regard.</p>
<p>Most traditional practice rituals will start with some kind of setting of intention. In Mahayana, Vajrayana, and Zen this includes dedicating one's practice to the liberation of all beings. A simple affirmation or verse could be said at the beginning and end of the session, for example. In Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana the Brahmavihara practices (the 'Boundlessnesses' of Equanimity, Kindness, Compassion, and Mutual Joy) may also be included as part of the session. If practiced sincerely, these are all remedies for the small self-centered mind that is so easily thrown off the path.</p>
<p>Tiredness is very interesting. Again, there is not just one cause. Exhaustion may indeed be a cause, but so may resistance or stagnation. We may tend to think that tiredness only means you should rest; but if you are experiencing the tiredness that comes with avoidance (say, avoidance of feelings that come up in meditation), the idea "I need rest" just becomes a good excuse to keep avoiding. So discernment is necessary.</p>
<p>Having done a lot of traditional residential and monastic-style training, I've learned a bit about my patterns of tiredness. I've come to see that so much of my (and <em>our</em>) tiredness isn't about real exhaustion but about what happens in the mind. Stagnation, for instance, is a very common cause of tiredness and also of boredom and other not-so-bright patterns of energy. A daily schedule that embraces vigorous physical exertion and full engagement keeps the energy moving, and can do away with stagnation-tiredness, or can bring that dynamic into sharper focus for you.</p>
<p>Resistance-tiredness is also very prevalent, but I think most of us don't recognize it so well at first. This is the tiredness that appears when you don't want to do or experience something; but you may not completely admit your resistance, so it remains relatively unconscious. It's like when you have to have a 'talk' with your partner or your boss. Suddenly, you feel so tired! "Can't talk now. I've had a hard day, I'm beat!" But really the tiredness is about the talk, not about your day. So much unconscious material gets processed in meditation, it's no wonder that this kind of resistance appears. Hopefully my comment will serve as a reminder that this exists as one of the causes of tiredness. The common cure is to continue forward with courage: have the talk, welcome the meditative experience, throw yourself wholeheartedly into the situation you resist. Meeting a challenge is envigorating.</p>
<p>Some tiredness is what we might call 'real' physical tiredness, but it comes from a lack of balance in areas of life besides over-exertion. Poor diet, irregular exercise, overthinking, overindulging in entertainment, poor posture, spending too much time with 'thinking machines' like computers and smartphones, living in an unclean or polluted environment, or harboring stressful grudges and worries can all cause real physiological exhaustion. Most of these causes can be brought into better balance if you just make the effort to address the issue. It doesn't have to be a life overhaul; small, simple changes can make a big difference.</p>
<p>And then there's sleep versus exertion. Do you need better or more regular sleep? Do you need to cut out some activities or 'work smarter, not harder'? Sometimes it's quite possible; and in other situations it's easier said than done. For example, being the parent of a newborn child is a situation in which you often just have to continue as best you can. But if you keep practicing <em>throughout</em> difficulty, the benefit is tremendous. Karmically, offering yourself to Dharma even through difficulty and pain is incredibly meritorious, and opens doors to great future possibility. But even in terms of your ongoing practice, the maturity gained is very significant.</p>
<p>(Continued...)</p>
