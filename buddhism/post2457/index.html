  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>These questions are very vague and abstract....</em></p>
<p>What makes them vague and abstract? Or I should ask, <em>who</em> makes them vague and abstract?</p>
<p>You make the idea that koans are vague and abstract, simply because you don't understand them. What a quick judgment to make! "I don't understand it, so it must be ridiculous. It must be meaningless." Aside from the fact that you haven't learned how koans work, this attitude keeps you from even beginning to learn.</p>
<p>Koans are very clear. They are not vague. But they don't play into your (our) need to have everything pinned down by concepts; so you (and many others) don't like them because of their function. Part of their function is to take you <em>beyond</em> your limited thought, <em>beyond</em> your attachment to concepts, to actual reality.</p>
<p>The word "koan" means "public case". It is a famous and often formalized rendition of an exchange that happened in the past — a teaching situation in which someone broke through the limit of their thinking, and gained insight.</p>
<p>There are many different themes and types of koans. Some are about very big questions like absolute reality, Buddha-mind. Some are about specific aspects of spiritual practice or life. And some are very specific indeed in clarifying certain attainments (for example, when someone has an awakening experience but becomes attached to it and thus fails to see another perspective). There are love koans, koans about correct relationship between teacher and student, koans about the meaning of practice, and so on.</p>
<p>One thing to know is that the original exchange that formal koans are based on came about through the expression of profound and spontaneous wisdom. Direct access to original mind, the source of wisdom. It is this same access that the student is trained in, and is expected to display when answering the koan.</p>
<p>So the answer doesn't come from theory or opinion, speculation, deduction, knowledge, guesswork, or imagination. The correct answer comes from the deep well of original mind — spontaneous wisdom. Mere spontaneity is not sufficient; it has to be spontaneity with the proper source. This is what the training is about: having your wisdom-source pointed out (by a teacher in face-to-face interaction) and then learning to trust it.</p>
<p>But someone with a big ego may not be able to bear the breakdown of concept. They may be more comfortable hanging onto their speculations and judgments than trusting their own true self! So koan practice is quite misunderstood and reviled by people who tend to cherish their own opinions above all.</p>
<p>Once you understand how koans function to elicit your own innate wisdom, they start to appear everywhere. Every situation becomes a koan, a teaching question. Every situation calls on you to fill in the gap, to complete it with your own beyond-thinking wisdom.</p>
<p>Hitting the floor is a technique, a tool. When a master does it, it has many possible functions. But in general as a teaching tool it means returning to 'zero', returning to neutral non-conceptual awareness.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of returning to your natural 'zero' mind, the mind that is perfectly clear and brilliant. Some ways have a lot of method to them, like meditations, visualizations, or other practices. Some ways may use chanting or even dance to clear everything out little by little. And some ways go there very quickly, very suddenly, with one penetrating action. Hitting the floor is just this particular school's way of going straight to clear mind.</p>
<p>When you get to clear mind, before thinking, then your original wisdom can function. Usually, your own concepts and opinions, habits and perceptions all create a big complicated filter that covers up wisdom. Your wisdom may say that you shouldn't eat that third ice cream cone, but your desire habit says "go for it!" Your wisdom says go help the troubled woman across the street, but your habitual thinking covers it up with "nah, what has she done for me?" Your wisdom understands the suffering your friend is going through, but your monkey mind is too distracted to even notice, or your distancing habit considers it trivial.</p>
<p>So it is necessary to cut through the crap that covers your innate wisdom. Hitting the floor and at the same time letting go of all holding and making brings you back to your own original clear mind.
How we need this practice in the world!</p>
<p>But cutting off all thinking only brings you to clarity, to the Absolute. (This point is the same thing that is named God, Buddha, Tao, Allah, Christ Consciousness, Energy, Unknowing, and many other names.) But the Absolute has no function, no relationship. It is only <em>zero</em>. If you get stuck there, you can't help yourself or anyone else. It is pure and clear, but it is not compassionate, because it can't relate. So after hitting the floor and returning to <em>zero</em>, you are invited into relationship: "Is that all? Only <em>zero</em>? If so, too bad for everyone!"</p>
<p>At that point, you have to demonstrate how that <em>zero</em> functions. How is God or Buddha-mind expressed in each particular situation? How does it move in relation to this particular koan? You have to come into the world of relationship and movement and demonstrate that ability to not only <em>contact</em> your original mind, but to <em>express</em> it within a particular context.</p>
<p>So you don't just say the first thing that comes to your mind. You say the first thing that comes from your original mind. The difference is subtle but important. It's not just arbitrary and meaningless. It's the most meaningful part of life: joining with the momentary situation, bringing forth benefit for all.</p>
<p>This is extremely beautiful. It is pure creativity, pure goodness. And this goodness comes from you, from your innate source, not from any made-up dogma or external authority. It is the ultimate anarchy, voiced in completely compassionate activity. You hit the floor and you make a trade: your ego-based concepts in exchange for your innate wisdom. Once you reach that point, everything you have — your concepts, memories, and talents — can all be used appropriately and compassionately.</p>
<p>So koan practice is about living a clear, wise, compassionate life.</p>
<p>It is said that <em>Zen mind is boundless and clear like space, but it functions like the tip of a needle</em>. This illustrates the two phases of koan work: attaining the mind that is clear like space (which sometimes may involve hitting the floor as a method of training); and attaining the very precisely appropriate function of your wisdom.</p>
<p>But if you are attached to your own idea, you can't appreciate or understand koans.</p>
