  <h1>Abused and bullied throughout childhood. Ingrained negativity, isolationism and dislike of people. How do I unlearn this and progress on the Path?</h1>

<p>Victims of abuse tend to echo their experience, taking the role of self-abuser in some way, either in thought or action or both. So one part of healing will be to care for yourself without indulging. There are many healing modalities, but whatever path you choose will likely involve introspection so that you come to recognize your self-harming patterns, and the actual practice of giving up self-harm and taking part in self-love. As I said above, this is distinguished from indulgence, in which you selfishly consume in order to fill in or avoid certain feelings or recognitions. You can take many specific self-loving steps in your daily life if you just begin to apply that attitude. When you go to eat, you can consider what food to offer yourself out of a sense of nurturing and care. When you start an activity, you can consider how you want to undertake it so as to be supportive. And so on....</p>
<p>It doesn't have to feel warm and cushy. For the heart that is very tight and hard it may take some time and repetition to get through. So you offer care in a neutral way. Of course, if you can manage some warm feeling, that is wonderful; but you can also just do it from a practical standpoint of helping yourself to be healthier and to function better, and to ease the mind just that little bit more. String a few of these self-care moments together and you gain momentum.</p>
<p>Perhaps the central issue for you is regulating what you eat. This means what you eat with your mouth, your eyes, your ears, and your mind. At some point you need to realize that you are the one bringing more negativity into your life, and that it's not helping you. It may make you feel justified in a certain way, but that justification doesn't help you, does it?</p>
<p>So when you are going to eat something, consider if you want to offer it to yourself with kindness. It doesn't have to be conventionally 'healthy' food; it has to be given with kindness and positivity. Likewise, when you are starting a train of thought, consider if that is what you want to offer yourself with kindness. If it makes you sick, don't eat that kind of thinking. Even if you think of it as correct or justified, it is the same as taking bad medicine; it is the same as taking poison. You are the one who determines whether you eat positive or negative things, okay?</p>
<p>It can often take you completely by surprise how deeply and warmly you can actually feel if you give yourself a bit of space. So don't make it a project where you are going to mold yourself into some image. Take a breather. Have a moment of not needing to do anything — not needing to prove yourself, and not needing to escape, but just putting it all down and having a bit of space.</p>
<p>One practice that helps very much is gazing at the sky. It connects you at a before-thinking level to your own spacious nature. You can also be near water to connect to your flowing nature.</p>
<p>The other side of healing is to offer your compassion outward, so your whole circle of attention doesn't just cave in to the gravity of self-concern, but radiates outward naturally and confidently. When you sincerely care for others and do caring acts for them, you feel more at home in the world. You become the host rather than the outsider.</p>
<p>Start loving-kindness practice with someone or something that is easiest to offer it to: someone who has offered you benefit or kindness without asking for anything back. Perhaps a teacher or even a stranger who once helped you. For many, a beloved pet or other animal is easiest to open the heart to, and to offer well-wishing and good feeling.</p>
<p>If you can't think of another being who you are willing to offer kind wishes to, then think of a being in a particular situation. If you can't bring yourself to offer anything but ill will to... say, Tom down the street... but you can remember one time when he said hi with a smile or helped you out with something, then you can focus on that event and let it bring forth your thankfulness and warmth. May you offer that to yourself... And may Tom also receive that.</p>
<p>"May I be well... may you be well... may I be well... may you be well...."</p>
<p>This creates the ember of warmheartedness that you can then begin to grow, letting it glow and radiate outward. Offering kindness does not put you in  a weak position, but a strong one. You become stronger doing it — more confident, balanced, stable, and in command.</p>
