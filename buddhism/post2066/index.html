  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I've lived in many types of community (from farming commune to intentional living between friends to Zen center), have done residential practice, have started and led practice groups, and have been director of a regional meditation center. What follows is my take on your situation. I don't presume to know <em>the right way</em>; I'm just sharing from my own experience. (So you can assume "In my view..." before each statement.)</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There's a common new-agey, age of Aquarius, politically correct sort of idea that community should be based on consensus. It just ends up being a lowest common denominator. Trying to make the situation nicey-nice for everyone loses the spiritual direction and the rigor that authentic practice requires. The situation then serves like and dislike rather than the view beyond ego.</p>
<p>So who is qualified to maintain the view beyond ego? It either has to be someone who has <em>attained</em> that view, or a group of those who have been sufficiently trained to hold to a framework that supports that view (such as a quorum of monastics).</p>
<p>If the aim is to have <em>actual</em> Sangha — community based on awakening through Buddhadharma — it is absolutely wrong to say that it should be conducive to all backgrounds and persons.</p>
<p>A very clear delineation must be made between <em>preference</em> and <em>practice</em>. And only someone who knows what constitutes practice can draw that line (someone who has, for example, attained stability in practice, not only sporadic experience). If no such person exists in your community, one would hope for a defining aspiration. Never mind preferences, diatribes, styles, other religions. If it's a Buddhist Sangha, only do correct Buddhist practice in one clear style.</p>
<p><em>And someone has to be responsible for maintaining the form.</em> After a form is chosen, it is not up for debate; because if it is, the picking-and-choosing mind takes over.</p>
<p>If you are clear about practice, maybe you are that person. If someone else is clear, let them lead. You can choose the form together, but then only do it, no picking and choosing. If you are clear and sincere, then invite others to join you or to opt out. Those who stay will be happy for the clarity and energy. Those who drop out need to find their own correct situation.</p>
<p>Harp performance seems strange for a practice session. Why did no one say "no, that's not what our practice is about"? Do you <em>know</em> what your practice is about? This seems more like catering to someone's self-image than doing practice together. One imagines that people may not have spoken up out of a sense of courtesy, or that they felt brow-beaten into complying; but there's no place for injecting personal hobbies into a group practice.</p>
<p>As far as personal or religious conflicts go, there are a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make it about the practice. The gauge of a participant is how clearly, sincerely, and consistently they show up for practice. (Therefore the practice form should be absolutely clear. Agree upon it; write it down; post or share it; then do it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let conflicts first be resolved one on one between participants. If there's an issue within practice or within the community, have a grievance process available; have people come to the practice leader with any complaints. Encourage open communication, but don't invite cross-talk and complaining. You can make use of helpful forms like Non-Violent Communication (NVC) by agreeing as a group to access them. If one-on-one resolution is not possible, then the conflict may be bumped up to the leader of the group or to a process the group has agreed upon. But if there is no previous standing process, in my experience getting other people involved often turns into a free-for-all. So it's best to agree on conflict resolution process ahead of time, and only escalate when necessary. Realize that some people don't want to be part of the politics, and only want to practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a group contract. Make it as simple as possible, but use very clear language (not just idealistic things that are easily sidestepped). For example, you may want to agree that other religions will not be discussed. You may want to state overtly that people of any gender, race, culture, or religion may participate; but that the Buddhist practice is very clear and indispensible. You can decide together; but make the commitment, agree strongly together, and then just do it. Let the chips fall where they may as far as people staying or leaving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>~</p>
<p><em>CPGumby</em> is right that the bottom-line direction is critical. You must realize what the group is <em>FOR</em>. If it is actually a Sangha and not just a dabbling meet-up, the purpose is awakening and compassionate living through Buddhadharma. That bottom line must be seen and embraced deeply. You must recognize that it will sometimes (often!) come into direct friction with ego and preference. So participants must know what they're buying into, and must agree together about the direction of the group.</p>
<p><strong>Many, many 'communities' give lip service to spiritual or social ideals; but what they end up really being is an attempt to use others to get a nice situation for oneself. They become an unconscious contract to look the other way, keep soft boundaries, avoid rocking the boat (of ego), and play at being spiritual — without ever calling oneself or each other to selfless practice.</strong> </p>
