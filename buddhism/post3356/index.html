  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The path is right here. Always right here; no other place.</p>
<p>This is a big topic, with so many considerations. I'm glad you spoke up, because it's important to know that there are cases when retreat is not beneficial or even safe, and times when method or application of practice needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Did you have any indication you were on shaky ground before the retreat? Most people will have some sign, if not full awareness, but they may not feel encouraged to divulge this and consult with retreat leaders about it.</p>
<p>You need to communicate your situation. Retreat administrators and teachers often have a set of requirements, a disclaimer to sign, or some other check-in process. Even so, people slip between the cracks unintentionally, or because they snuck in.</p>
<p>Sometimes participants come to the retreat in hopes of doing away with mental disease issues. It starts with an incomplete understanding of the purpose of meditation, it grows with hope and fantasy that outweigh practical experience, and it is enabled by hiding rather than facing the mental and emotional issues that are perceived as personal flaws. Meditation is not a cure-all. Other therapies or lifestyle changes will address some issues much more appropriately.</p>
<p>A level of readiness is assumed before one enters retreat. If mental stability (a certain degree of concentration or calmness) has not yet been established, coming closer to the mind in meditation can provoke upsetting responses. With the longer duration and greater intensity of a retreat, a pressure can build up between the sincere desire to be better, on one hand, and mounting anxiety or upheaval, on the other hand.</p>
<p>Certainly, addressing the cause of the psychotic break is important. The pressure of some situations may precipitate a breakdown, but the cause is usually present well before the situation is encountered. Pressurized situation aside, what kind of support are you looking into to address underlying issues? (You don't have to say online; just know that it's an important step.)</p>
<p>For some people, sitting meditation that brings them in close contact with the mind is not appropriate. Other practices that calm the mind and develop the discipline of presence without directly confronting the thinking mind may be safer and more effective in many cases.</p>
<p>Going forward, if you find that intensives like the Goenka retreat are not safe, you'll have to find both the style and level of practice that works well for you. This can mean being on the outside of some practice groups that expect everyone to act together; but if you communicate your situation to teachers and administrators I'm sure you'll find many groups to be very accommodating. The group's usual aim, after all, is to help all sincere seekers, not to cater only to an elite.</p>
<p>People in your situation often find that they have to be their own advocate and supporter. Established institutions sometimes lag in their awareness of mental health issues. But in the centers I've attended throughout North America (and also some in Asia) there is a great deal of awareness and care for people who want to practice but who struggle with mental health obstacles.</p>
<p>I've written many times on the effectiveness of physical practice, and it's appropriateness where sitting meditation is a problem. Search my posting history. I'll also try to post some links. Prostration practice is an excellent training for establishing a strong center without coming into close contact with the thinking mind. It can be done in the context of spiritual teachings, or as a stand-alone practice. Those with a devotional nature can also include that aspect when prostrating, though the inactive can be done without it.</p>
<p>There are many other physical trainings with a spiritual dimension. Occasionally, a martial arts teacher may also be a spiritual master, though many only give short shrift to the spiritual side.</p>
<p>In some thankfully rare cases, there seems to be an ongoing obstacle to many kinds of meditation. Some people get headaches whenever they attempt meditation. Sometimes it can be treated, in other cases it seems intractable. This comes down to a matter of karma -- there is a karmic block to practice. If this is the case, your recourse is to change the karmic situation through ethical action, generous deeds, and devotional practice.</p>
<p>Meritorious, ethical activity is always a very important part of spiritual training -- a part that is often ignored in the contemporary meditation boom. Personal merit forms the basis of all other practices; and there is no possibility of progress in meditation for someone who does negative action elsewhere in life. If there seem to be frequent obstacles to practice, building karmic merit is even more significant.</p>
<p>Some traditions also emphasize contact with an enlightened being as a way to progress on the path. <em>Darshan</em> -- 'viewing' or being in the presence of an enlightened master -- is a practice said by many Hindu practitioners to bring the mind to its divine nature; and this has some correlation in Buddhist guru yoga as well as in the experience most people have of increased joy, focus, and aspiration when in the frequent presence of their master.</p>
<p>There are many, many spiritual practices besides the commonly known sitting meditation: chanting, mantra, prostrations, walking, visualization, devotion, and work ('karma yoga') in the spiritual community or community at large, among others. Other healing practices beyond meditation include shamanic healing (received) or practice (learned and performed), bodywork, therapy, art and music (and art or music therapy), free dance, qigong, Taiji, Yoga, and many more.</p>
<p>You definitely should be addressing the reason behind your breakdown, but you can also look into any of the options mentioned here.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
