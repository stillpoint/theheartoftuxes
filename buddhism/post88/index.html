  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I suppose first we might ask if there are physiological or psychological issues to be addressed. Is there lingering effect of trauma? Is there a learning disability or hearing or eyesight problem that makes things more difficult? Some things you can't fix by yourself. If this kind of issue has been ruled out, then we can move on....</p>
<p>What's the correct function of expectations â€” to become set rules that you can't deviate from, even if new knowledge and circumstances appear? Or maybe to provide a structure that helps you clearly choose an initial course of action and measure your progress?</p>
<p>At your age, whether you're in high school or university, the theme of finding your own values is very prominent.</p>
<p>In younger years, parents and family provide a set of values. This is important because it is based on a great deal of experience that the child doesn't yet have, sort of like getting concise notes. But as the person gets more of their own experience and prepares to move out into the world on their own, unfolding their own character and their own role in the world, it becomes time to question and experiment with values. Few people know at this point just what their role will be; it's a period of not-knowing but trying.</p>
<p>I don't know why it's coming up for me, but I wonder if it's something you need reflected back to you: this is your life, nobody else's; and you can decide what is important to you. That is to say, you don't have to live up to someone else's idea of what you should be or feel; and you don't have to keep pushing at something you find no value in. There are good reasons to keep trying at difficult things, and there are bad reasons. The standards that have been implanted into you have their usefulness, but you have a right to decide your own standards.</p>
<p>One aspect of this is that different people move out into the world at different paces. It's like the way things unfold in nature: some organisms mature very quickly, some very slowly, and some in between. Some animals can walk and even run soon after birth; it is their destiny to run. Some animals stay close to their dens and parents for a time, because other faculties develop; it is their destiny to move in more complex relationships. Similarly, we all unfold different parts of our personalities at different paces; and there are reasons why we stay inward or venture outward at various times.</p>
<p>Is staying a kid <em>serving</em> you? Regardless of what anyone says or thinks about it, and just from the perspective of usefulness and importance, is it helping you? Do you need to stay protected for a while? Does something in you need a sheltered environment in which to grow a bit more?</p>
<p>Or is it about fear and avoidance? Do you avoid trying because you're afraid? Feeling sorry for ourselves is often a sly way of avoiding responsibility.</p>
<p>Anxiety is the epidemic of our times. This is a systemic, societal illness; it's not just you, it's the world we live in that's becoming anxious. In large part this is because of our severe and growing disconnection from our <em>ground</em> â€” disconnection from place, from Nature, from family, from ancestral lineage, from culture. When we're online, for instance, we're not connecting to the parts of life that hold and support and reflect us; we're not having organic human contact; we're not seeing ourselves reflected in the faces of friends and family; our mental life becomes everything and the root of our body is disowned and forgotten.</p>
<p>When the ground that all these things provide is lost, anxiety automatically follows. Disconnection and distraction dictate one's actions rather than the ground of interconnectedness.</p>
<p>So one big point is to start reconnecting, and make it a priority to reconnect. Reconnect with Nature, with ancestry, with the body; and begin to weed out influences that contribute to distraction and disconnection: electronic 'thinking devices', disturbing or trivial relationships, disorder in living space, unkind or dark or meaningless actions.</p>
<p>Next, find appropriate challenge. Begin to move out into the unknown. You can do it at your own pace, but do it; challenge yourself to try. The great benefit, the great power, of your phase of life is the intrepid attitude â€” the will to try something new. Make use of that power.</p>
<p>This is not just an empty encouragement; it has direct influence on the anxiety you're asking about. This is because fear is a polarity; it is a range of emotional responses with a pivot point. On one end is what we usually recognize as fear: trepidation, timidity, anxiety, and at the far end sheer terror. On the other end is vibrant awareness.</p>
<p>Many military veterans speak of the vibrant, meaningful life that comes hand-in-hand with the fear of death in combat. Knowing they could die any day, any moment brought tremendous focus to them, and made their relationships with their fellow soldiers some of the deepest and most meaningful relationships they will ever experience. It would be very unfortunate if only war and terror could do this; but that's not the case. There is a <em>pivot</em> that tilts one end of the see-saw, fear, to the other end, intense presence. That pivot is one's willingness to engage â€” to feel the fear and to nevertheless proceed into the unknown.</p>
<p>It is possible to be so interested in what you're doing that fear completely turns to excitement and attention. See how cats move in the night, and you can observe that see-saw at play: at one moment there is a jittery mistrust, at another moment there is a sleek, grounded presence â€” the cat is highly aware of everything, but flowing through the night on its own adventure. No doubt this heightened vibrancy is what some cats hope and dream for as they demand to be let out.</p>
<p>It is the same for us. We can travel to a new country and culture, and stay walled up in a safe resort where everything is taken care of and there is little uncertainty; or we can take on the intrepid spirit and venture out. With this spirit, just taking a walk around the block becomes magical and meaningful. For some, trying out the restaurant down the road will 'push the envelope' quite enough; others might take on a solo wilderness trek or go skydiving.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what others do. What matters is that you â€” of your own accord â€” decide to live <em>your</em> life, and venture into the unknown. In <em>some</em> way, begin to embrace the big mystery. Sometimes failing; sometimes losing; but it's all part of the big dance. What you get or lose is not as important as participating in the big dance.</p>
<p>The more you move out into the unknown without being pushed by anyone else, the more you will be operating from your own center, according to your own values. Then you can try your best without fearing failure. Not because you've ensured that failure never comes, but because you trust your own movement enough to include both success and failure.</p>
