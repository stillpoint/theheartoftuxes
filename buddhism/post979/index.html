  <h1>I want to brighten up the world, but still have five small questions.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Here, 'love' and 'passion' are talking about similar things. Namely, attachment... craving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buddhadharma teaches that craving creates suffering. This is the fundamental teaching, the basis of cause and effect that all schools of Buddhism agreed upon. So this is the kind of 'love' and 'passion' being spoken of.</p>
<p>People don't understand 'love'. Ask a thousand different people what it is and you can get a thousand different concepts. What we know of it has been conditioned by countless romantic movies and songs and stories that revolve around the drama created by craving. This is all love 'for me', as if you could <em>get</em> love and -- I don't know -- absorb it or eat it and be fulfilled by it. That's not love.</p>
<p>Love driven by a sense of incompletion isn't love. The incompletion comes from the basic misunderstanding of who we are. One thinks of oneself as separate, and therefore one deeply feels separate; one feels the loss of the universe, the loss of completion; and one's whole life becomes a more or less vague quest to 'get' completion. One seeks it in experiences, states of being, the collection of possessions, the collection of skills and knowledges, and in relationships: "you complete me". That's bullshit love.</p>
<p>Real love turns that around. It comes not from a sense of loss and a selfish impetus to grasp and devour something, but from one's original completion. It is not feeling but harmonious response. It is 'for you', because this 'I' is already complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we prostate, we prostate to that original completion. The Buddha represents our true, complete, awakened mind. So we bring our small, petty, negative, suffering being back to this completion. It is a very good relationship! To bring the wounded, needy, broken one back to its healing, back to its completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha represents this: what we really are. But in addition, the historical Buddha revealed the path that allows us to actually attain our true awakened self; so there's an additional layer of gratitude and respect in bowing to the Buddha, or to any enlightened being helping us along the path. If you don't yet feel that gratitude, or shy away for religious reasons, no problem; just bow to your greater self, your original mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different traditions teach the precepts differently. The <em>Vinayavada</em> (way of the ethical code), also sometimes called the way of the śramanas or Theravada (the way of the elders)  or sutrayana (the scriptural path) requires you to follow the precepts very strictly. Mahayana and other traditions follow precepts just as strictly, but also include the guidance to use your wisdom in applying the precepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the differences in application is the general thrust of teachings, where Theravada tends to be a bit more about purifying oneself of faults, and Mahayana tends to be a bit more about saving all beings. Of course, Theravada saints save all beings and Mahayana saints have purified themselves, so the difference isn't exclusive; there's just a difference in approach. All Buddhist traditions can lead to enlightenment.</p>
<p>In Zen, they may say "know when to apply the precepts, and when to abandon them". It means that <em>before</em> precepts there is your original wisdom mind, from which all precepts arise. The precepts are given so that you can return to your mind of wisdom; but the mind is primary. When your mind is functioning well, you don't need a code of conduct. Attaining your mind is beyond religion in this sense. But since our ignorance is very deep and tricky, we use precepts to help us attain our true mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to make up reasons to have a watch or any possession. It doesn't all have to be about spirituality. You like the watch -- no problem. You can buy it, enjoy it, and move on. Attachment to the watch is a problem, but in the grand scheme of things it's not the biggest problem. Guilt about having the watch is another kind of attachment problem. Also not the biggest deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>But know the danger of making and holding opinions! Let go of your big attachments, the ones that keep you from offering big love to the world. Then you can take care of watches and things.</p>
<p>As you practice, your attachment will naturally sort itself out. Even treasured possessions will start to lose their taste, lose their power to grab you. Your passion and joy and inspiration will be fully to help all beings out of their suffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>But take great care with this notion of "I'll do it later". Being a little better than yesterday is maybe a good thing, or maybe a trap. If you condense it into a philosophy, it can be a way of avoiding your responsibility, and a way of making compromises.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two points here. First is that you are already complete. So 'being good' is not really the aim. It's just a convenient way of taking about practice sometimes. But really your job is to express your original completion, not to try to be something in particular. This point comes clear with practice integrated into daily life.</p>
<p>The second point is that cause and effect are clear. Issues of love, emotion, goodness, precepts, attachment, and so on are not about some set of standards foisted upon you, but about the results you get from your thoughts and actions. Originally there is no good and bad, there is just cause and effect.</p>
<p>There's a story about a butcher who killed animals for a living. Having learned a bit about Buddhism he thought that he could do his killing during the day, and then do good action at night, like charitable works, studying the Dharma, and doing meditation. The story says that after he died he went to a place where at night he experienced great blissful heaven, and during the day he suffered unspeakable agony of hell.</p>
<p>You can't escape the results of what you put into motion. Therefore it is said that you should avoid doing even the smallest negative action, and make a point of doing even the smallest positive action. This is the mindset, but we all have the reality of our current capacity, and adding guilt to the mix is not helpful.</p>
