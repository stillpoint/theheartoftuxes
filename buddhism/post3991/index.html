  <h1>When practicing shikantaza, can I intentionally think about my day and see the impermanence in things as long as I maintain alert awareness of my surroundings and thoughts as just passing in the moment?</h1>

<p>These questions should, and must, be investigated by each of us. Just hearing someone else's response can't help us, even if the response happens to be a wise statement that we agree with and believe and take to heart. Although others may (or may not) point out where the treasure lies, you have to find it for yourself. Or using another analogy, although you may hear about the medicine and learn about its ingredients and believe in its good effects, you actually have to take the medicine yourself.</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes in spiritual pursuits is failing to make the distinction between opinion and attainment. We have developed the habit of pursuing ideas, and we try to collect 'the right idea' by reading or hearing others speak. This is a habit we reinforce daily, and one that is encouraged by society at large. The mutual contract is that if we read more or read the right books and forum posts, share catchphrases and encouraging excerpts on Facebook, wear certain (now not so exotic) accessories or act certain ways, <em>then</em> we can consider ourselves 'spiritual'. But the rigor required by shikantaza points to the kind of effort that is necessary to actually <em>get</em> a spiritual experience for ourselves.</p>
<p>The reality that is facing you right now does not depend on ideas. Things are as they are, regardless of your opinion. The sun rises in the east. Water is wet. And this moment, the sensations and sounds you are experiencing are what they are. It is <em>thinking</em> that brings about the unreality we live in. Rather than just hearing the sound we hear, we assume "Oh, that's the refrigerator". But what we hear is <em>not</em> the refrigerator. What we hear is not even a sound — that's just another idea, another label. 'Refrigerator' is an idea we make about a collection of experiences that are always changing. Metal parts that, whether in motion or 'fixed' are constantly exchanging atoms with the atmosphere, freon and air that circulate and constantly negotiate rising and falling temperatures, electrical currents from the power grid as well as those that maintain atomic relationships, and ever-changing configurations of shelves, drawers, and door — all that motion is what we name 'refrigerator'. And there's more yet. 'Refrigerator' is also our past experience and how it plays into what we see and sense and feel (emotionally) about this conglomeration of parts in our kitchen. So we don't hear the sound of a refrigerator. What we hear is "whrrrrrrrrrr". (It might be closer to the truth to say that what we hear is our mind; but that too is an idea, not the actual experience.) Our experience and our idea are two different things, although they too influence each other. The idea 'refrigerator' is placed on top of that.</p>
<p>And so rather than living with raw reality, we create a world of ideas, populated by 'things' that exist only because we have named them and made assumptions about them. We live in a dream made by our thinking. Awakening means seeing through that dream and attaining reality.</p>
<p>Which do you believe in more — your idea or your experience?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these words I'm typing will tend to take you even further away from reality. And if they seem wise or clever, you may believe in them even more, taking you farther yet.</p>
<p>But if I don't write anything, then how will I bring attention to the issue of awakening? So I choose to make a mistake in order to help us wake up. As soon as possible it's best to let go of words and ideas, and investigate the matter ourselves, directly through our experience. That means we need to practice contemplation ('looking into') and meditation ('putting down').</p>
<p>Follow your own sincere questioning. Don't try to go too fast, seeking shortcuts from someone <em>else's</em> understanding, or jumping to conclusions. Follow it through meticulously. What is awakening? The only complete answer is to experience actual and full awakening, which takes a great deal of perseverance. But to trade an actual experience for a verbal answer you can pluck out of someone's writing is a <em>terrible</em> trade, a terrible cheat on yourself.</p>
<p>The reason I asked, in my original reply, about the aim or purpose of presence and awakening was not so that you would seek a quick 'right' answer, but so that you would look into the matter and avoid going down the wrong path. Most of us, because of our human conditioning and habits, travel the spiritual path with some mixture of motives that are on one hand sincere and on the other hand ego-based. Rather than purely offering ourselves to the moment as-is, we may seek a better, more comfortable situation, or to make ourselves more powerful, or to see ourselves as 'good'. These are all understandable, but they are not the pure path, and will not help us to develop wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>In classical Buddhist terms, the aim of awakening is to overcome the cycle of suffering. That does seem like seeking a better situation, or empowering ourselves. But when that pursuit is ego-based, it becomes an avoidance of any reality that is unpleasant, and attachment to any reality that is pleasurable, and an ignorance of any reality that is neutral.</p>
<p>Ego-based spiritual pursuit also assumes that we can get something on our own, without tying our fate to that of others. Our own best situation becomes the focus, and we bail out on compassion for others. That this is morally petty is not the central issue. The central issue is that this cannot lead to our awakening, because it separates us from the Whole. It makes our minds small and separate rather than broad and all-encompassing. Likewise, picking and choosing our favorite outcomes makes our minds narrow rather than open and all-embracing.</p>
<p>So "why get enlightenment" means please look into the role of ego here: do you want enlightenment only for yourself, or do you include all beings? Will you use your experiences only to make a better situation for yourself, or will you use your experience to help everyone and everything? If your heart sincerely intends the latter, then your practice is already unconditioned and pure, and you can make use of all situations, good or bad; and even before enlightenment everything you do will benefit the world. But if the attitude in pursuing spiritual attainment is to get something for yourself, then you are merely reinforcing the illusion of self that makes you suffer in the first place; and even if you have magnificent experiences, they will not benefit you in the end.</p>
<p>Pure intent means that, big or small, events in your life will also be pure. Selfish intent means that small events will have small selfish results and big events will have big selfish results.</p>
<p>Does this make sense? Do you understand why I encourage you to look into the direction of your life and spiritual pursuit?</p>
