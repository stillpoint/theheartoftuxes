  <h1>How to improve the understanding of the teachings?</h1>

<p>Your situation is more and more common these days. With all the connectivity we have in the modern age, we seem to actually be less and less connected.</p>
<p>Why do you say you can't go to a practice center in person: what's the issue?</p>
<p>It's great that you are working with a teacher. Please ask your teacher these kinds of questions, and anything that causes you doubt. Just don't expect to have all your doubt and questioning swept away instantly.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>It's not a flower that you pick; it is a ladder you must climb.</em></p>
<p>You can't just pluck the right phrase and suddenly understand. There is no pill you can take that will download knowledge. You have to live it. It takes time to find good teaching, to take it in, to study it, to try it out in practice, and to digest the results. Only then can you be said to have an initial grasp on the teaching: when you actually put it into practice.</p>
<p>So first realize that it takes time, focus, and effort. It takes time: it doesn't happen just by getting the right responses from some outer source; there's a whole process to learning. It takes focus: you need to bring yourself back to the issues with consistency; it doesn't help you go deep if you keep switching the place where you're digging the hole. It takes effort: this is not an outside-in sort of download process; the teacher points you in the right direction, but you have to do it yourself in order to make the knowledge your own.</p>
<p>Some pointers on study:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If you have connected with a capable teacher, follow his or her recommendations as much as possible.</strong> There will be a time of getting to know each other and getting to know the teaching, and you should rightly take care in making sure the whole situation is trustworthy. But once you have determined that your teacher is offering good and true guidance and that the path is sufficient for you (<em>sufficient</em>, not <em>perfect</em>, okay?), then you need to start putting your doubts to rest by yourself and show up as an open vessel in the teacher-student relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not only your teacher's responsibility to teach you; you have to <strong>strengthen and improve your relationship and your attitude.</strong> You have to become a humble and attentive student, a broad and open vessel for the Dharma. You have to keep connecting with your teacher and strengthening your bond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this respect, you may do well to avoid going to other sources for a while, like studying with other teachers or reading many books. <strong>Let one signal get through loud and clear</strong> instead of tuning into many at the same time. As much as you want to grasp as much knowledge as possible, grasping will not help you at all; it will complicate your learning and slow you down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on one thing at a time.</strong> Take your time. Develop the very important skill of taking your time. It is a study skill and a meditative practice skill: don't rush, don't manipulate, let it sit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When people dancing with each other go too fast they end up in disharmony, not knowing what to do and not even being able to track what just happened. So they need to slow down until they develop their skills. Similarly, if you read or talk too much there are too many ideas dancing with you too fast. <strong>Learn how to go deep with one concept before moving on.</strong> It doesn't mean you have to understand something completely before moving on, because that will very rarely happen. Usually you will start to understand something, and then a year or two later you'll realize something new and think "Ahh, now I <em>really</em> understand!", and then a year or two later something else will dawn on you and you'll think "Oh man, I thought I understood but really I don't!" It goes on and on like this. But the important thing is that you show up for each learning. Don't treat the teachings like trash: "Ah, yeah, I heard that. I'm moving on to something else." No, not like that. Take care to honor each concept, each teaching, and let it have space to resound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To give another example, when a whole roomfull of musicians are playing their own music on their own instruments it's hard to make sense of any of them. A single sound gets lost in the chaos. But if there is space... silence... respect... then a single sound can ring out clearly, and you can hear it deeply. You can hear not only that it is a bell sound, for instance, but what kind of bell sound, with what kind of quality. Its message goes deeply into you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So for instance you may <strong>extract one key teaching from something you read, and write it on an index card or at the top of a study notebook that you carry with you.</strong> Then use it as the theme of the day. Revisit the theme several times during the day. Consider how it applies to the things you're doing, the way you're relating to your activity. No need to understand it with your thinking, just let it sink in. If you don't yet understand it, revisit it later and see what has changed about your conception. If you still don't understand it, ask your teacher for a guiding phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's a saying that a good student 'sees one and gets seven'. That is, you only require one part of the puzzle, and then through your patience and effort and open-ended curiosity you eventually get the other seven parts. (Eight parts is considered complete in East Asia.) <strong>Don't always require all eight parts to come to you easily</strong>, otherwise you never learn how to get them on your own, and you never develop the ability of 'see one, get seven'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn a basic practice</strong> such as meditation or mindfulness, or a devotional practice if that's your style. <strong>Start doing it in small ways but regularly.</strong> Five minutes or so of meditation every morning is very, very wonderful. One minute of meditation three or four times a day is another very wonderful arrangement. As you practice consistently your practice will become like a mirror that reflects these issues to you. You won't have to struggle to see how they connect to your life, the awareness will come naturally through your practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stick to one style and teacher</strong> for a while. Many teachers have excellent, correct teaching, but their teaching works within a particular context, uses particular vocabulary, and takes a particular path. All of these elements may not line up well from teacher to teacher; although the essence is the same, the path can vary widely. So avoid confusion and deepen your understanding by sticking to one thing. If you keep chopping at the tree, it will eventually fall; but if you keep moving to every new tree and giving it just one or two hits you'll not get any firewood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make some space in your life.</strong> Frequently the obstacle to concentration is the general jumble of life. If you are always busy with something, and if your living space is always complicated and messy, and if your relationships are always complicated and messy, it will be more difficult to focus. Start bringing order and space to your schedule, to the way that you engage with activities, to your living space, and to your relationships. You can't usually overhaul it all completely, but you can make a little breathing room in one corner. That will help. For example, keep at least one part of your room clean and orderly — the part that's used for study and practice of Dharma.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you find it difficult to make space in your life, that is a good sign that your priorities need to be reviewed.</strong> What is so important that it fills every moment of the day? What is so important that there is no mind space for the pursuit of Truth?</p>
<p><strong>The way you study</strong> also has an influence on what you take in. If your mind is already full of thoughts or busy with activity it will be difficult to cram something else in. If you are tired from not enough sleep or too much work or entertainment, also it will be more difficult.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to study when you're fresh and alert.</li>
<li>Don't study on a full stomach.</li>
<li>Some vigorous exercise like brisk walking, bicycling, Yoga's Sun Salutations, or prostrations (bowing) makes you both more alert and more settled; it also nourishes your brain with oxygen.</li>
<li>In your study session, begin by consciously settling down and letting go. Don't enter your study session unconsciously, just consuming words with no sense of purpose.</li>
<li>First, take a quiet moment.</li>
<li>Next, recollect your great purpose: to wake up, and to help all other beings.</li>
<li>Take care of your posture: let it be upright, noble, and relaxed. If you need support for your arms so that your shoulders don't hunch and tighten you can use a pillow under them. If you find you are tensing up because you're looking down at your study materials, raise them up on an easel or bookstand or pillow. Let your legs spread out so your belly can be free to breathe, which delivers more oxygen and energy to your brain.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive sugar and refined foods like white breads and cakes, which cause your blood sugar to plummet after an initial spike, and dull your awareness.</li>
<li>Very importantly: know when to stop! Don't just keep reading and reading out of habit. Take one thing in, put the book down, and then either contemplate quietly or get active — go do something.</li>
<li>End your session with gratitude to your teachers and to yourself, dedicate your learning to your great purpose — "May I awaken and help all beings escape suffering" — and take a quiet moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>My teacher repeated one phrase many thousands of times. Lesson after lesson, sitting after sitting, year after year the same teaching got driven into me. One message related to everything I did, all of life. Gradually I took it in; gradually I made it may own. It takes time. Don't expect to know. <strong>The correct beginner's situation is not to know, but to try.</strong> And in fact, that's always true.</p>
