  <h1>Is there a way to be friends with someone without being enticed into doing things you've separated yourself from?</h1>

<p>Some tips for nurturing your practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remember your great compassionate intent</strong> at the start of the day and at the start of practice. As soon as you wake up, remember Buddha, the gift of the new day of life, and your aspiration to gain enlightenment and help others. (One nun friend suggests 'hugging Buddha' upon waking.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simple <strong>dedication</strong> to your wide mind of compassion can be given before you sit. It can be as simple as taking refuge in the Three Jewels ("until I myself awaken completely") and wishing that your practice benefits all others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Zen temples, meditators recite the Four Great Vows:
 &gt;Sentient beings are numberless, we vow to save them all</p>
<p>&gt;Delusions are endless, we vow to cut through them all</p>
<p>&gt;The teachings are infinite, we vow to learn them all</p>
<p>&gt;The Buddha Way is inconceivable, we vow to attain it</p>
<p>There are many variations, but the main thing is to recall your wide mind, and to start practice with that recollection and intent. Immediately carrying through the intent with action (doing practice) creates a deep bond with Dharma and generates strong karmic merit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice with a teacher.</strong> I can think of no other factor that is so influential. In terms of cognition (learning), inspiration, example, emotional support, grounding influence, and subtle blessing, being around an accomplished teacher or awakened being is of immeasurable benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice with a group</strong> and offer yourself to a schedule of practice. You gain inspiration and human nourishment around other sincere practitioners. Committing to group practice also helps you keep going when your own patterns would otherwise drag you off the path. The comradery helps you, and the structure of the schedule helps you. (The ego doesn't always like it, but the way-seeking mind <em>loves</em> it!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do some <strong>vigorous whole-body-and-breath exercise</strong> every day. Ideally, move enough to break a sweat daily. This benefits your body, your level of energy, and your ongoing mood, and it helps to settle your mind more quickly and comfortably during meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulate your schedule, environment, and relationships.</strong> Take in nourishing and inspiring things; let go of mess, unclarity, pettiness. Associate with Dharmic influences; let go of waste. Eat healthy. Take care of your sleep. Keep a clean living space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenge yourself</strong>. Taking on challenges, small and large, opens new sources of energy. As you break through your old preferences and barriers you are naturally inspired and invigorated. An example of a small challenge may be giving up a preferred food for a day, or trying out a new activity. An example of a big challenge may be facing your fear of public speaking by giving a speech, or doing a long retreat at a temple. You know your own habitual patterns: challenge them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A home <strong>altar</strong> can be an inspirational support and grounding influence in good times and difficult times. When your motivation is high, an altar can focus and enhance that energy. When your motivation is low, an altar can remind you of what's important to you. Even just passing by an image of an awakened being, set in a place of respect, communicates with your deep mind and strengthens your connection to Dharma. The altar can be big and fancy or small and humble. It just needs to be sincere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean and renew your altar regularly. This sends a message to your deep mind that you are respecting the Buddha within.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're noticing a drag, you might <strong>look into these two questions</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;What's dragging me down?</p>
<p>&gt;What would liberation entail?</p>
<p>It may be time to let go of something, or someone, in your life. It may be time to take something up or ask for support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep doing it</strong>, even if it's boring, even if you don't feel like it. Practice doesn't depend on feeling. It's not about your like and dislike. Going beyond your like and dislike will be like electrons jumping to another level in an atom, making tremendous energy available. Throw out the notion that practice is always supposed to feel a certain way. Only show up; grow your ability to show up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This last suggestion is highly recommended as the way to generate strong and clear motivation.</strong> The suggestion is offered not just by me, but by many great masters. It will benefit almost everyone; but if depression or dark thoughts beset you it may be best to avoid it until greater stability of mind is gained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remember death.</strong> Consider your death in detail, not just in a theoretical way, but taking it to heart and spending time with the issue. Know deeply that <em>you will die</em>, that <em>you don't know how soon this will happen</em>, that <em>each living moment is a precious opportunity</em>, and that <em>the only thing you can rely upon after death is the result of the virtuous activity and awakening practice you performed in life.</em> Everything will go away — your possessions, your fame, your talents, your ideas, your relationships, your body — and the only thing guiding your passage into new life will be the seeds of good or bad action planted deep in your subtle consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can consider all the very real and possible ways you could die even today, from illness to accident to natural disaster. Some ways are more likely according to your external situation (e.g., maybe you live in <em>tornado alley</em> or in an earthquake zone, or maybe your job has inherent risks) and your constitution (maybe your lungs are weak or you have a congenital condition). You can also study what happens to people when they grow old or get sick and die, and you can envision the process as a way of training both your equanimity and your understanding of impermanence. This is a very transformative practice.</p>
<p>Remembrance of death can be performed before your first formal practice of the day, or it can be an entire meditation of its own. Frequently visiting the issue and taking it to heart can completely vitalize your life and practice, utterly reordering your priorities. Many masters continue to meditate on death throughout their careers, it is that highly respected as a transformative practice.</p>
