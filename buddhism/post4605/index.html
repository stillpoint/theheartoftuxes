  <h1>27 Sources of Negative Behaviour (Shantideva)</h1>

<p>Our common idea of matter as 'solid stuff' is so very far from  what has been described by science. What is really going on is that we are taking our illusion, or misperception, of the way things are and slapping a 'science' label on it. People think that materialist ideas that 'stuff is just stuff' is a scientific view; but that is very far from being true.</p>
<p>Modern science is still completely uncertain about the makeup of the universe, the substance of this 'stuff'. The objects we identify — body, car, rock, table — can be spoken of in ever-greater detail, but a basic foundational particle or principle has not been found. For quite a while now, scientists have maintained that, in simple terms, matter is energy and energy has mass. As they follow through on Particle Physics and High Energy Physics, they are finding that the so-called building blocks of existence are not substantial: when viewed as particles, atoms and their subatomic constituents are 99.99999% space. But even these extremely empty, spacious particles are not substantial in the way we commonly understand the 'stuff' around us: they are buzzing waves and fields of probability, where one so-called particle can occupy all space simultaneously. I have no expertise in this field, but I'm confident that if some advanced Particle Physicists would chime in, we'd hear a description of a world far closer to the Buddha's description of Interdependent Co-arising than of our habitual relationship to life as a collection of separate, solid objects.</p>
<p>The common, unexamined view of materialism — that we live in a world of stable, solid stuff — is not at all supported by science. But one moment of true insight in meditation will provide a <em>direct</em> experience rather than a theoretical one: you can experience for yourself what the world is made of.</p>
<p>Even setting aside the very foundational nature of science dealing with atomic and subatomic particles and universal forces, what we know of biology contradicts our common materialist view. Because of their attachment to an idea of self, people think the idea is real, and that their body is their 'self'. This requires a view of the body as a separate and stable object, a <em>thing</em> in itself. But we know that the body is constantly changing, in every moment: cells are being generated and sloughing off; air and fluids and food and light are being absorbed and transformed into flesh and bones and blood and hormones and activity; carbon dioxide, uric acid, and many products of cellular activity are produced, circulated, and excreted through breath and sweat and oil and urine and feces. But we don't see our bodies as science informs us, as wildly swirling maelstroms of matter and energy, as unending streams of interrelationship with the world; we don't see our bodies as belonging to the movement of the universe; we see them as "this thing is solid, and this thing is me".</p>
<p>Furthermore, we don't extend this knowledge to all other human bodies and living things, acknowledging and relating to ceaseless inter-flow. We think "this is me; that is you; and that thing over there is a lamppost". Our habitual view is utterly different than what even basic science teaches.</p>
<p>If you look at a photo of yourself as a baby, and another as a toddler, and another as a pre-teen, you then have proof of the absence of any set form. But the way your narrow frame of mind sees the body is stable. This reflects the frozen and limited nature of thought, not the fluid, boundless, and interrelated nature of reality. Your world comes from your ingrained thought, not from the way things really are.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>This is an excerpt of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/3604m1/question_about_taoism/crea6q7">my previous post</a> on r/Taoism:</p>
<p>&gt;Thoughts and words are closed, unmoving, separate, and limited. If they weren't, they wouldn't have meaning. But because they have a meaning that points to something specific, by their very nature words and thoughts are limited.</p>
<p>&gt;On the other hand, what words and thoughts point to is broad and open, ever-changing, interdependent, and not limited to a single meaning or dimension. Consider what we call a 'tree', for instance: we say "tree", and immediately and automatically think we know what that means. "No need to look; that's very easy; I know what that is!" And we think of a certain shape of object, something very definite that we can point to as 'tree', as opposed to everything else which is not 'tree'. But if we use our scientific knowledge we know that 'tree' is really atomic particles (or rather, sub-sub-atomic particles or whatever they're made of) or energy and space. We know this from science, but we certainly don't relate to 'tree' as that.</p>
<p>&gt;Further, we know that everything a tree is comes from earth and water and air and light energy. Everything! There is no tree without earth and water and air and sun. 'Tree' and these elements are completely, and inextricably linked. If we look to the origins of earth and water and air and sun, we also see countless other inextricably linked dependencies. So there is no thing that exists by itself. Everything is completely dependent on everything else. This is scientific knowledge, but it certainly isn't what we see or understand or relate to when we hear the word 'tree'.</p>
<p>&gt;Yet further, 'tree' arises from seed, through germ and sprout and sapling, through constant growth and change through influence by the elements. It is moved and shaped by the wind, by the availability of water, by light and fire and storm. Even the light of the night's stars is absorbed and becomes the substance of 'tree'. Sometimes it is scratched by a bear or pecked by a woodpecker or cut down by a lumberjack. Before it is a seed and after it is cut into boards or rotted into the earth, it is still the same unbroken process; so only our own arbitrary definition of a beginning and ending claim when the tree exists or doesn't; in reality, the tree itself never existed and never failed to exist. The parts of the tree — the earth and water molecules, the solar energy, and the patterns of accumulation and dissipation that form what we call a 'tree' are there long before and long after we can point to something and name it. So 'tree' really is all movement everywhere, in a very real, scientific view. But that is not what we understand in our thinking. Our thinking is like a child's crayon drawing that makes a shape. At first, it is only a pointer, only a short-form way of communicating about something: "Hey, look out for that tree!" or "If you go over to that tree behind the hill you can get some apples." But very soon, we get lazy about distinguishing between thought and reality, and thought becomes our reality.</p>
<p>&gt;So we live in an imaginary world of separate objects, and worst of all we become imaginary objects in this world! We very deeply believe that we are small, separate selves within a vast universe of separate objects. This all comes completely from our thinking. It is a very deep dream, a very deep ignorance about real life.</p>
<p>&gt;And not only, that! Then we add other imaginary ideas, things that don't exist at all until we make them up. The whole realm of superstitious thought is overlayed on our already deep ignorance, in addition to all the projections we make — stories about what other people are thinking, what's going on for animals, what other cultures are like, what the world is like.</p>
<p>&gt;All of our shared suffering comes from mistaking thought for reality, and in particular our suffering comes from misunderstanding who or what we ourselves really are. We overlay the idea of self, and miss the reality. So our lives are very deeply rooted in fear. There is an underlying anxiety to everything we experience and everything we do. We start from a place of helplessness and separation, completely because of our attachment to thought (originally it is not so!). And starting from this weak and fearful place, we spend our lives conniving to amass the things we think will help fill the void. All kinds of neurotic and perverse and horrific behavior appear because of this. The holocausts of history and the daily tragedies all come from our deep attachment to the illusion of separation, which arises because of our mistake about thinking.</p>

<p>Science approaching Buddhist teachings:</p>
<p>&gt; Recent knowledge of the Higgs Boson particle points to an unseen, unknown field behind matter. <a href="http://scientificbuddha.org/post-7-buddhism-and-science-5-higgs-boson-particle-physics/">Buddhism’s own version of particle physics has a particle with a name that precisely describes the function of the Higgs Boson.</a> That particle’s relationship with other subatomic particles is precisely the same as Higgs Boson’s relationship is with the other subatomic particles in the Standard Model of Particle physics.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://scientificbuddha.org/5-buddhism-and-einstein-3-from-inflationary-cosmology-to-multiverse/">Recent String Theory and Multiverse Theory approach Buddhist Cosmology.</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&gt; Neutrino particles, possibly the most abundant particles in the universe and once thought to have no mass, are now thought to have a very small ("almost no") mass; but that presents its own issues:
To extend the Standard Model [of particle physics] so that it incorporates massive neutrinos in a natural way will require far-reaching changes. <a href="http://ctp.berkeley.edu/neutrino/neutrino.html">For example, some theorists argue that extra spatial dimensions are needed to explain neutrino mass, while others argue that the hitherto sacred distinction between matter and antimatter will have to be abandoned.</a></p>
