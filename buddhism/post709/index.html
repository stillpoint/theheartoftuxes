  <h1>I want to join a Buddhist monastery in himalyas. How do i go about it?</h1>

<p>That's wonderful that you want to become a Buddhist monk! It is a very good job, in which your hard study and your hard work will be offered to the benefit of all beings.</p>
<p>There are a few things to be aware of:</p>
<p>First, since the life of a monk is offered to others rather than to get a comfortable situation for oneself, it is necessary not only to support yourself but to even make more of an effort than the common person, in order to support others. That is, you must not be a burden on other sincere practitioners and teachers and generous laypeople, but on the contrary you must do your utmost to give up your self-concern and work for <em>their</em> benefit.</p>
<p>This is the job of a monk. So you shouldn't view it as a free ride, but rather as a way of life in which you take on ever more work in order to relieve others of their burdens.</p>
<p>Next, peace and freedom don't come from getting your favorite situation. The reason for going to the mountains to practice is that it is a helpful place for doing intensive practice; it is a place where you go to do inner work, not a place where you go to escape outer work. And in fact, in most monk training for the first years you will have to do a lot of outer work as well, both to support your community and to train in giving up your own preference and opinion.</p>
<p>That is what leads to peace and freedom: giving up your own idea and your own wanting. So if the motivation to become a monk has to do with avoiding complication, maybe that's not very good training for you; maybe that's a misunderstanding. Yes, it is wonderful to study and learn and practice; but once you have a certain stability in your practice you should be going out to face the world, not escape it. That is training in freedom and peace.</p>
<p>For example, many people are attached to money and possessions and plans. This binds them and causes them suffering. Seeing this, we may think "money, possessions, and plans are bad; so let's avoid them". But that is just a different kind of attachment. Your mind is still moved around by money, possessions, and plans. Real peace begins to appear when your mind is no longer moved by these things — by the formations of life — either toward or away from them. You can be with a situation or you can be without it, no problem. You can have lots of money or you can have little money, no problem. Knowing that money is an illusion, you can use the illusion to benefit yourself and others.</p>
<p>In fact, the Himalayan training (in the Seven Points of Mind Training in Tibetan Buddhism) says:</p>
<p>&gt; <em>After meditation, be a child of illusion.</em></p>
<p>You mustn't let the illusion push you around. But participate in it. Knowing it is illusion, participate in it, let it be a parent to you by helping you unfold. Therefore, money or any other appearance is not to be escaped, avoided, or destroyed; rather, it is to be seen for what it is.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with anything in the everyday world, avoiding it might not help you overcome your problem.</p>
<p>But you have already worked for 3 years, so maybe you have some understanding. Maybe your aspiration to wake up and help all other beings is very strong. If so, that is a very good basis for becoming a monk.</p>
<p>You can go to visit some teachers and practice centers connected to the Himalayas. Perhaps you can find some connections locally, and start learning the practice, studying the forms, and developing a strong basis in a particular lineage of training. You need to go in with open eyes. That is, you shouldn't just throw yourself into the practice setting without knowing what it's about, why it's good for you, what the teacher is like, and so on. You have to be aware and responsible for yourself. This will also provide the all-important foundation for your future practice; because it is essential to eventually be completely free of doubt. If you go in blindly, certain doubts will plague you throughout your practice, and you will not be able to advance.</p>
<p>So maybe you find a teacher and group in your area and start studying and practicing with them. Or maybe you take a few trips to practice centers in Dharamsala or elsewhere, to learn about practice, see what a monk's life is like, and make connections that will help you in your choices.</p>
<p>The more remote and solitary your practice, the stronger you have to be in it. At first, most monk training is almost completely set out by the teachers and senior administrators — there is not much of a concept of 'free time', and every activity of the day is already set out for for the monk in training. This trains the mind not to look here and there but to take care of the task of the moment. It also trains the mind not to attach to habit or preference, but to follow the situation. Later, when a monk has become very stable in practice, it may be possible in some lineages to do solo retreats or other forms of individual practice. But as I said above you will have to be free of doubt about what to do with your mind at any given moment; so going through proper training is all-important.</p>
<p>What have you done so far to learn practice and research possibilities?</p>
<p>If you want to name the area where you're living, maybe someone can recommend a practice place or teacher near you. But you'll have to do some research and experimentation on your own. I researched, traveled, and tried many different teachers and practice situations before I found my root teacher. And it was utterly worth it!</p>
<p>Good luck in your search.</p>
