  <h1>Practicing among many different sects?</h1>

<p>What's important is to see the cause and effect involved in your chosen (or accidental) path. There are advantages and disadvantages to every approach; if you are aware of what you gain and lose then your choices can be effective.</p>
<p>The most vital point is how the various options will affect your awakening. Outside of the issue of waking up to your true nature and living a clear life, all the rest is fluff. If there's a sense that the central point can be achieved by going here and there, plucking bits of wisdom to be added to a pile until it's big enough... well, let's disabuse ourselves of that idea from the start. To address any but the most shallow layers of yourself, the stark reflection, intimate communication, and clear guidance of a good practice and teacher and community are almost invariably necessary. Even the greatest masters — very advanced spiritual beings who were ripe for awakening — required the guidance of a teacher to lead them to the other shore. Only one in many billions of people may get enlightenment without assistance of others, and only because of much (some say aeons of) previous practice and development.</p>
<p>The pivotal cause to be addressed is the illusion of selfhood — the deep-set image and idea we have of ourselves, often called "ego". It is not that we need to destroy this selfhood, because it does many useful and necessary things; but we are trapped and limited if we don't perceive its emptiness, its illusory nature. This illusion is held so dearly that we can actually experience violent life-and-death reactions when it is threatened, as if upending the illusion means killing ourselves. With this ingrained pattern in play, how well equipped are we to guide our own practice? How resolute will we be in addressing and changing our grasping habits? How completely will we let go when push comes to shove at the deeper levels of mind? The assistance of something <em>beyond</em> our ego is needed. A teacher who is able to function beyond ego, a Sangha of companions also committed to awakening, and a clear practice method are all "beyond-ego" assets that can help us in ways that are often beyond our ability to help ourselves.</p>
<p>Having said all that, it may take some time and exploration to find a good fit. While it's not necessary to find your <em>favorite</em> situation, if a situation goes against your bent of nature it can be more difficult to thrive. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing: sometimes we need to experience the "dust work" — the pure trying, with no apparent result — in order to rouse our deep aspiration and devotion. And sometimes there are things we need to learn about ourselves and our relationship to the path before we can settle down well in <em>any</em> situation.</p>
<p>There is no formula for your unfolding. Some people travel around from teacher to teacher for decades before finding the place where they blossom; but then they do blossom. Others are moved to commit early on to a "good enough" situation, gradually deepening their connection and the benefit of the relationship over the years.</p>
<p>When your direction is clear and your center is strong, you can visit many different situations and study many different ways. Clear direction means you always know <em>why</em> you are practicing — the ultimate aim is always cherished and nurtured. Strong center means you can always return to clarity, to the present moment, no matter what you hear or experience; you may be thrown off balance occasionally, but you can quickly return. With clear direction and strong center, everything is a benefit. Good teaching and bad teaching, wisdom and pettiness, ease and difficulty all help you grow.</p>
<p>But if your direction is not clear or your center is not strong, then engaging in different methods and moving from setting to setting will only destabilize you, throw you off. The same words are used different ways, the same attainments are reached by different methods; if you have any propensity to attach to words or environment or personality, then the differences will create misunderstandings or distractions that will get in the way of progress. Occasionally, those misunderstandings or distractions will be inevitable and necessary — you may need to suffer greater confusion before you are able to understand what clear direction means, and commit to it. But as much as possible, beginning students should seek to stabilize before seeking <em>more, more, more</em>. </p>
<p>First get clear on your direction, then you can use any event that arises on your path, whether it is good or bad.</p>
<p>Your writing show that there is indeed some inclination to attach to form and technique. Seeking your own comfortable mix of forms is not a good way for you; it is the distancing activity of the ego, focusing on form and looking to pick and choose rather than surrender. Your true direction doesn't depend on <em>form</em>, okay? Find a practice situation where there is <em>sincerity</em>. As long as the form is clear (without opportunity to slack off or let the mind wander off during practice), and as long as the form can lead to awakening, it will be good enough. (Not every meditation practice leads in this direction! Some may be more about feeling good or gaining personal energy than uprooting ignorance!) Once you have some months or years of experience in facing your own habits of attachment and escape, then you will be more able to choose your practice situation wisely.</p>
