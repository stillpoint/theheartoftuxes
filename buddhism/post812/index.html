  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Meat eating is not allowed in some traditions, with certain exceptions (e.g., if you have not killed the animal and it was not killed for you specifically); but in practice adherents might not eat meat unless it is unexpectedly offered (in which case they would accept the generosity rather than be dogmatic about it). This is the general tendency in Theravada Buddhism, for example. It is based on a very practical standard of karmic response: <em>Will it further or hinder one's progress toward liberation?</em></p>
<p>In other traditions eating meat may be allowed; but just because it is allowed doesn't mean the adherents do it without care and consideration. For example (at the risk of making too broad a generalization), since Mahayana is about practicing and unfolding and awakening together with all beings, the thought leans more toward eating what you need to eat in order to do vigorous together-action and actively save all beings. In contrast, more solitary traditions may tend to limit eating as part of self-discipline and ethical behavior.</p>
<p>But even many Mahayana, Zen, and Vajrayana monks and lay-practitioners may as a rule abstain from eating meat. Vajrayana, these days largely emerging from Tibet where the land doesn't support widespread growth of vegetables, tends to allow for the eating of meat; but its meticulous regeneration of compassion tends to counterbalance that allowance, and as a result many who <em>could</em> eat meat, don't.</p>
<p>Consider whether your practice, your effort in life, is based on rules or on wisdom. Hopefully the two are mutually supporting! When we've proven to ourselves that our wisdom is not always reliable (yet), then we adopt rules and commitments to guide us, to make our karma correct and lead us to the purity and liberation that would not be possible were we left to our own devices.</p>
<p>But by the same token, the rules must be interpreted wisely. If you are not healthy enough to practice well and help others, you may question the wisdom of withholding nutriment. Some traditions may say that even suffering in this way purifies your karma. This is at best a very gradual approach, requiring many, many lifetimes of behavior correction to bear karmic fruit. At worst, it becomes a Jainist approach of self-sacrifice, not the Buddhist Middle Way. Other traditions say that if your heart-mind is clear and loving, all behavior is open to you. Zen, for instance, tends to give responsibility very quickly and fully back to the student, requiring them to rely on their own innate wisdom rather than a set of rules. (Or, rather than <em>only</em> a set of rules. There is still the necessary guidance offered, to help the student connect to their wisdom in the first place.)</p>
<p>But there's also a deeper recognition that the whole debate, and indeed the whole view of life as a collection of separate beings and objects, is moot... fallacious. All forms are projections of mind. At higher levels of practice, this point is emphasized. The 'sin', if you want to call it that, is not primarily that you rely on another's death for your life, but that you <em>conceive</em> of others as separate beings — essentially, that you <em>kill</em> with your ignorance, dividing the one bright, vibrant reality into dead concepts and categories.</p>
<p>Thus in some Vajrayana ceremonies, one takes a sip of alcohol and a bite of meat, in part to establish one's freedom from dogmatism and acknowledge the mind that lives beyond the concept of separate beings, contrived rules, and relative transgressions.</p>
<p>Many masters have pointed out the profound significance of eating. One enlightened Hindu master said (echoing her teacher and many others) that correct eating is at least half of the battle in spiritual practice. I've heard other, Buddhist, masters teach that <em>everything</em> is eating — the eyes eat, the mind eats, we eat each other: if you know how to eat, you know how to live.</p>
<p>The Venerable Maha Ghosananda often teaches on the connection between spirituality and eating. He goes deeper than you might expect. If you're interested, seek out some of his teachings.</p>
<p>Here's a preview of one of his articles in Tricycle Magazine (you need a subscription to read the whole article):</p>
<p>&gt; 
&gt; All beings are dependent on food, that is, eating. There is food for the body, food for feeling, food for volitional action, and food for rebirth.
&gt; 
&gt; The Buddha cried when he saw this endless cycle: the fly comes and eats the flower; the frog comes and eats the fly; the snake comes and eats the frog; the bird comes and eats the snake. The tiger comes and eats the bird; the hunter comes and kills the tiger. The tiger's body becomes swollen; many flies come and eat the tiger's corpse. The flies lay eggs, and the eggs become more flies. The flies eat the flowers, and the frogs eat the flies. . . .
&gt; 
&gt; In Buddhist stories there is a big giant with many mouths and many teeth. This giant eats everything. This giant is Time. If you can eat Time, you can gain Nirvana.
&gt; 
&gt; You can eat Time by being here and now, by living in the moment. Then Time cannot eat you. Time is the eater.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As I've done many times before in discussions on ethics, I want to bring awareness to the fact that clinging to opinion is far more harmful than karmic transgressions like eating meat. Worse than eating meat is the thought "I am right, you are wrong" — regardless of which side of the debate one lands in. Clinging to opinions, and judging others and pitting oneself against them are behaviors that weaken the Sangha and cut one off from the Dharma itself. Indignant opinionation creates a wall that blocks the unconditioned view.</p>
