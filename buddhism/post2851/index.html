  <h1>I can't detect the sensation of breath going through my nostrils</h1>

<p>I hear that there is some curiosity based on your studies in Psychology, and that you have had beneficial and provocative experiences in the past, finding a peaceful gap in the chain of thinking. You also say that you had an experience of losing yourself completely in your breathing, and that it felt like coming home, and was the best feeling you've ever experienced. You say that you want to experience that again for purposes of understanding.</p>
<p>Finally, you say that you thought that counting was somehow numbing your focus, and also that at times in practice you have had disturbance around breathing and have felt like you were suffocating.</p>
<p>So it seems that although you had a profound experience of unity, your relationship to it now is leaning toward the intellectual. It reflects your bent of nature these days. The positive side of this is that you can use your curiosity to bring penetrating energy to the practice; the negative side is that mental activity can get in the way.</p>
<p>If you like plain awareness of breath as a practice, that's fine. Choose a method, as perhaps outlined in Mindfulness in Plain English, and follow it strictly. But there was also nothing wrong with counting breaths as a practice, especially given the nature of your aspiration. It is not the counting that forms an obstacle, but the way your thinking habit relates to the form (any form) of practice.</p>
<p>Focus comes and goes. That is natural. It is necessary <em>not to attach to the condition</em> of your meditation session, and only to try â€” only return to the method. Even with plain awareness of breathing, the quality of your attention will vary. That is not a problem; but if you let that disturb your effort, trying then to manipulate your practice in order to get more focus or in order to get a certain experience again, then <em>that</em> is a problem. That is no longer equanimity and pure effort; it becomes seeking and grasping, which is an ego-based activity. Of course the illusion of self hates to be disturbed; it wants to keep 'living', so it tries to regenerate itself through thought patterns and controlling behavior. This is none of our business in meditation.</p>
<p>(This becomes more vital as you progress. As your mind gradually approaches stillness, many old energies and stuck patterns are released, appearing as strange or powerful experiences. If you attach to those experiences, then you lose your way and create new patterns; but if you continue unattached, your mind will become clean and bright.)</p>
<p>And that is how form helps us: by sticking closely to the form, we develop equanimity and the ability to be present through all kinds of situations. But if we give up the form and try a different form in order to get a different effect, then we are merely practicing the ability to give up and seek a different situation. We already know that practice very well, all of us!</p>
<p>So it is important not to check your mind. Don't try to make your practice deeper, only keep trying evenly and depth will come by itself. This is an expression of faith â€” in yourself, in meditation, in life.</p>
<p>You say you are not really on a spiritual journey and you don't think you will find anything. You <em>are</em> on a spiritual journey; your thinking habit is just denying it. If this moment is not a spiritual journey, then there is no life, no spirit, no presence, no awareness, no waking up to reality. But in fact you have already experienced a moment of waking up when you experienced unity with your breathing, and I would suggest that you have experienced waking up many, many times without noticing it. Many things in your life find the gap between thoughts, where real life lies: perhaps the first taste of a glass of orange juice, or coming across a racoon at night, or the particular quality of a warm breeze on your skin, or making eye contact with a baby or a loved one. You've "been at one" with many things in your life already. So there is somewhere to go.</p>
<p>Doubting that there is somewhere to go or doubting your ability to get there is one of the biggest obstacles you can make for yourself. If you consider the matter, you will see that it is a prejudice, and assumption rather than a full conclusion. So please try to approach meditation free of assumptions about what will or won't happen, and about what you are or are not capable of. You don't know. That is clear: we don't know what will happen. We only know that we choose to go in a certain direction. We want to "come home", as you called it.</p>
<p>As I said before, either method is fine. I do have some concern that since your engagement is quite a bit 'up in the head' (through thinking), and also since in the past you've had disturbing feelings of oppression of the breath, merely focusing on the breathing may pose its difficulties. That is, having counting to focus on could be helpful for you in your situation. But if you decide strongly, then either way will soon bring you to the calm place.</p>
<p>Just don't chase after the calm place. That is not the final destination, only a way-station. Whether you reach the calm place or whether your mind's demons come to fill in the calm place, the practice is the same. Only continue. Without stopping anywhere, that is freedom. That pure, independent, not-stopping practice is a million times better than the calm place.</p>
<p>Good luck in practice and in life!</p>
