  <h1>When practicing shikantaza, can I intentionally think about my day and see the impermanence in things as long as I maintain alert awareness of my surroundings and thoughts as just passing in the moment?</h1>

<p>No, you should not be thinking about anything in shikantaza, and especially not <em>intending</em> to think about anything. Thoughts may (and almost definitely will) arise, but there should be no effort to engage with them, either to grasp and follow them or to push them away or destroy them. The mind should be absolutely stable and unmoved by either thinking or not thinking.</p>
<p>Next, you ask about maintaining alert awareness of your surroundings and returning attention to the external present moment. That is also not shikantaza. In shikantaza there is no internal or external, no distinguishing between you and your surroundings; there is only the still and luminous mind. The practice is not to make any concept (like "external" or "present" or "moment") and not to move the mind in the slightest, and not to try to get or avoid anything.</p>
<p>Shikantaza is also not simply calmness. It is intensely, vibrantly awake. There is just no feedback or checking of that awareness on the part of the meditator. One rests in it without letting it rest in any particular place, without attaching it to any particular object. So it involves a great deal of trust and openhandedness in the practice and in your own essential mind. In fact, the practice, your essential mind, and the world-moment are the same thing in shikantaza. Shikantaza is the embodiment of faith in the unity and perfection of your mind-as-it-is and the world-as-it-is, without adding the slightest extra thing.</p>
<p>"Shikantaza" can be translated as "to hit the mind while sitting". When you get hit in the head by surprise with a snowball, at that moment there is no inside and outside, no you and no snowball and no situation; there is only <strong>BAM!</strong> In shikantaza, we let every moment hit us deeply. There is only the impact of the moment, without checking whether it is impacting you or how deeply it does or what your reaction is or should be. Absolutely open-handed and unmoving.</p>
<p>Another way to describe it is that it is keeping your mind like a mirror. Any kind of event can appear, but the mirror only reflects perfectly without any mark and without any lingering image. The image and the mirror are not separate; but the mirror is also not the image. But the salient point of practice is that the mind is perfectly open and stable, not following the images that appear in it.</p>
<p>This is an advanced practice, and if the mind often wanders off with thinking or often automatically focuses on an object, whether 'internal' or 'external', then there is kind of a diminishing return — it can become not worth it to pursue shikantaza when the mind can't be brought to stability. Rather, it can in that case be most helpful to practice an object-based meditation that teaches you how to concentrate by relinquishing extraneous thoughts (or one might say, that strengthens your power of concentration or stability of mind).</p>
<p>Watching or counting the breath is commonly assigned, among other popular concentration-style meditations. Some of these can be used through your whole spiritual career; others will only take you part-way, and should be let go of once a certain level of concentration can be accessed regularly. Once you are able to let go of distraction more easily and are more comfortable with the emptiness or lack of anything to grasp, it may then make more sense to practice shikantaza.</p>
<p>Of course, if your determination is strong and sincere, there is no obstacle too great. Some may find correct shikantaza by staying with it. But sincerity of determination is not just made by your personal effort; it also comes from your life's conditions and situation. If you don't have the proper conditions, then you simply won't have the energy to persevere in the right way, and your mind simply won't be stable enough. That is why proper conduct, relationship, diet, and many other factors are also very important and in fact crucial. A good teacher will be able to guide not only your formal meditation, but also the proper arrangement of your life to provide the conditions necessary for correct shikantaza.</p>
<p>I would recommend seeking a good teacher and community. I would also generally recommend trying an object-based meditation like counting breath before trying shikantaza. With an object-based meditation it is very important that you take care not to have any acquisitive attitude — don't try to 'win' at meditation, don't try to get any particular state of mind. This is important training for shikantaza. Only keep returning to the method, without judging how it's going.</p>
<p>Finally, at the basis of any practice is your direction. Why do you want to practice meditation? Why do you want to do shikantaza? What would be the purpose of being present or becoming awakened — what would you do with that? This points to the purpose of your life as a whole. When your direction is clear, then your meditation can be clear, and <em>any</em> meditation practice can be correct.</p>
<p>Non-grasping, non-holding. Very important.</p>
<p>Why do it? Also very important.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As others have said, shikantaza is difficult to convey in words. Any attempt is already a mistake. So saying that "we let every moment hit us" may encourage the reader to try to stay in the moment, or to think that there are separate moments that come one after the other. This would also be incorrect. It is not necessary to try to stay in a particular place; but it is necessary not to <em>go</em> to any particular place. Everything must be put down.</p>
