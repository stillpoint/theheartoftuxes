  <h1>Other than the demon mara, has buddhism discussed any other evil entities and how to relinquish them? I'm dealing with something right now.</h1>

<p>Your approach is okay if it helps; but making positive also means negative is there, so it's not quite complete. Best is not to make anything.</p>
<p>There are many, many kinds of entities. They all come from mind. Even the "you" and "me" entities in this conversation come from mind. That is how there appears a being to be harmed at all — our whole situation is a projection of mind. Take care how you feed into the situation, giving it energy with your worry and speculation. Take care how you make plain phenomena (a sound, a feeling, etc.) into stories that spin out of control. The more <em>you</em> involve yourself and make a big deal, the more energy you give the haunting situation.</p>
<p>Take care about leaping to the conclusion "demonic" just because you experience uncertainty or fear; because you create your own situation through your thinking.</p>
<p>People often play into a pattern of haunting through their well-intended resistance. Because they habitually resist, they build the story and its energy into something to be resisted. The more frantic they get about it, the more real and established it becomes. Few people consider that — if there is an actual external entity involved — these haunting beings are essentially the same as us: despondent, lost, frustrated, angry, hurt, hungry, and so on. They are like some people we meet who are beset by their negative emotions and can't seem to find a way out. In fact, they are like we are at times, driven to act in ways that agitate or harm others. Compassion is always in order.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" "How can I help you?" "There's no need for this; it's okay." "May you be well; may you wake up out of your suffering." You can communicate with compassion. Chanting and envisioning light are fine practices; but doing them out of reactivity isn't complete. They should move toward awakening for yourself and all others, including disembodied beings. The awakening is the cure for all suffering. That is why one of the forms of Buddha is as a medicine-giver; awakening is the medicine that cures everything. So you can continue your practices, but out of compassion, sharing awakening with all beings including ones who are troubling you.</p>
<p>The most pure and direct practice is to put everything down and go straight to Unknowing. One famous Zen Master called this "go straight Don't Know." That point is complete; nothing can harm it.</p>
<p>There are many stories of ghosts, demons, and mirages being dispelled by Unknowing. If you understand mind, it is clear why this is the case: there is nothing there to be harmed.</p>
<p>&gt; One story tells of a famous teacher who was very upright and pure in his conduct and thought. His action was wonderful and his Dharma speeches were brilliant, so he attracted large crowds to his talks. But he started to develop a rash on his leg, which grew into a bump, eventually looking like a nose. This was very strange and disturbing, and not the kind of thing a great Dharma Teacher usually has to deal with.
&gt; 
&gt; Doctors tried treating the nose-looking bump with all kinds of medicines, but couldn't get rid of it. Soon it grew into a face. Then the teacher and his doctors were very concerned. They tried burning it off, which was very painful, but to no avail; it would only grow back again. Then eventually the face started to complain and yell obscenities. The great Dharma Teacher had a face on his leg, constantly insulting him and yelling swear words! Obviously, he could no longer give Dharma talks; and he couldn't even go out in public any more.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, after trying every other option to get rid of the obscene face, the teacher yelled back, "What do you want!!?" At that point, the face started talking to him. Soon he learned the reason for the 'possession': in a past life he and the man the face belonged to were enemies, and he did many bad actions causing great hatred and desire for revenge. When he killed his enemy, the enemy's spirit vowed strongly to seek him out in his next life and get him back. But out of concern for being the victim of revenge and out of regret for the warring and killing, this man's mind had already turned around and he started to practice Dharma very sincerely. He only kept clear mind — Unknowing. His good practice and good intentions carried over into his next life, and he gained the causes for becoming a great Dharma Teacher. All the time, he only practiced clearly, so his mind couldn't be found anywhere. The enemy spirit searched, but could find no trace of him. But when these big audiences appeared to hear him speak, with hundreds of people praising him, the teacher started to get some pride — he started to get "I"; so immediately the enemy spirit could find him.
&gt; 
&gt; Through talking, expressing his sorrow and regret, and offering compassion to the tortured spirit of his former enemy, the teacher was able to come to good terms with the being, and the face soon receded and disappeared.</p>
<p>This story has several teaching points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, when unpleasant things beset us or even possess us, our habit is resistance: we try to hide them; we try to get rid of them. But actually talking to them and embracing them with compassion are what begin the purification process. Harmony requires looking at the disturbing thing and understanding why it is there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, all present situations have past causes. Things don't happen arbitrarily for no reason; all forms come together in streams of causes. If there is negativity in our life it is because we ourselves have at some point created or invited it. So ultimate purification of negativity and danger means we have to understand our hand in bringing it about, and changing our karma — changing the intentions and actions we make, from harmful to beneficial, to complete. Your sincere practice of compassion, generosity, ethical conduct, meditation, and correct relationship is necessary if you are to be free of similar difficulty now and in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, clear practice — keeping Don't-Know mind — makes you un-findable by harmful spirits. If you have a mind, all kinds of influences come into play; and then you wrestle with techniques and pit positivity against negativity; but if you don't have a mind, where can these influences take hold?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, "I"-thinking makes you findable and subject to harm. Thoughts like "I am good" or "I am bad" are both incorrect, as they are both based on the illusion of self. This I-thought is the basis of all suffering. In the story, the teacher's pride attracted danger. In your situation, maybe your fearful self-protection is attracting danger. For others, maybe greed, jealousy, or other forms of clinging do it, creating the sense of self, which is then subject to danger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the complete and direct practice is momentary: complete open-handed presence. This is Zen. I've spoken with a Dharma Teacher who had been the victim of possession, and he said as much; he was very clear about it: possession is the result of your karma, and the cure is keeping Zen mind, keeping moment-to-moment Unknowing. This is how you help yourself.</p>
<p>Compassion moves in this direction, open-handed to the complete situation. Unknowing completes it. So those are your best strategies, best tools.</p>
<p>But it sometimes happens that people invite very powerful negative influences into their lives, either by association with the wrong people, submitting to corrupt teachers, dabbling in psychic or spiritualist practices, or even literally calling on other entities to come. In general, your own sincere compassion is very influential, and powerful enough to clear all kinds of negative influences; but some invited beings are very powerful indeed, and not swayed by compassion. These are beings who have held angry grudges and harmful intent for long, long periods of time, over what would amount to many lifetimes for us.</p>
<p>Usually, the negativity we encounter in ourselves and others is a matter of being temporarily lost: we or others can't see the way, but our hearts and minds can be opened and we can change the direction of our activity. But these beings have very strong commitment to aggression, and have accumulated a lot of power. They are not necessarily dull and incapable; they can be very skillful indeed. In these cases, you may need the help of an achieved Master, someone who has the power to subjugate these kinds of beings. There are masters in all branches of Buddhism capable of this. Vajrayana in particular has many, including some who may have special ability in this regard. Unless you have made particular invitations to powerful beings, I wouldn't think you need this kind of help; but if it turns out you do, you'd best seek out some awakened masters in your area.</p>
<p>Right now, your task is to put it all down and return to the simple moment. Return open-handed, without making anything special — no story, no strategy, no resistance. This is your protected state. Keep your mind like that, not in reaction to anything, and I believe you will be okay. May you be well, may all beings be well.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot to mention that there are many protection practices in Buddhism. Some of these are seamlessly integrated with daily practices, such as you may find in most temples. Others are given like prescriptions for specific difficulties. Vajrayana in particular has many remedial practices like these, calling on the power of great masters (living or otherwise), protector deities, or Bodhisattvas (like Black Manjuśri). For the most part, you can continue your own practices with compassionate intent, and do what I've recommended above, and you'll be fine. If you want to try other protective practices it will be necessary to receive instruction and perhaps initiation from a master.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also neglected to mention something very basic, which is taking refuge. This is part of keeping your correct relationship to the moment, but it is a very basic, overt, conscious step to take for your protection. In Buddhism, taking refuge means to go to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha for your safety, and nowhere else. It doesn't mean you can use nothing else for protection, like not being able to use an umbrella against the rain or not being able to travel with a companion for safety. It means that at the bottom of it all, at the most basic level, you put your trust in the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.</p>
<p>Buddha means your original enlightened nature as well as the fully enlightened beings, whose minds are the same enlightened mind. Dharma means the expression of that enlightened nature, as well as the right teachings of Buddhism. Sangha means the beings who participate in enlightenment and its path, as well as the community of Buddhist monks, nuns, and those who hold and transmit the teachings.</p>
<p>Formally taking refuge, you harness your sincere intent to the power that is beyond all entities — the Buddha. You literally rely on the ultimate protection. The historical Buddha, the fully enlightened beings, and your own original enlightened nature are all one and the same. This is where you go for refuge, for protection. It's not like aligning with a gang for protection or calling on a strong friend (or strong entity) for protection, because although they may give temporary protection something stronger can always come along. The situation is subject to impermanence, subject to change. But the Buddha's protection is not subject to comparative strength, and not subject to change. It is the aspect of yourself that is already perfectly pure, safe, complete, unborn and undying and unchanging.</p>
<p>So once or three times per day you can formally go for refuge ("I go to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha for refuge until my enlightenment"), and you can take refuge situation to situation, moment to moment, by entrusting yourself. This is the same as Unknowing, ungrasping. You let it all go and put yourself in the hands of greatness. It is like the Buddha touching the earth in response to Mara's challenge: I rely on the one thing that is beyond all challenge. Not a word of defence needs to be spoken, nor a single technique needs to be performed.</p>
