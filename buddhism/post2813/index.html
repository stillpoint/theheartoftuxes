  <h1>Is Buddhism a religion? - why we need ethics!</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I disagree. I think that his advice was profoundly religious in nature.</em></p>
<p>I agree; I also think His advice was profoundly religious in nature. I've practiced in the Buddhist religious setting for decades. I still don't see the Buddha urging people to <em>think</em> of his teaching in this way. The urging was toward living a holy life, not belonging to a movement. Perhaps religi<em>ous</em>, as opposed to religi<em>on</em>.
Maybe I'm flying off the handle with my words.</p>
<p>It's all everyday life to me. Monks are monks, lay people are lay people. Essentially, we're the same. Our own minds make the world sacred or profane.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Not quite--he urged people to work toward the cessation of suffering. In order to do that, we sometimes have to put off immediate happiness.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, sacrifices sometimes need to be made. I would distinguish between putting off getting what we want and putting off happiness. Happiness/cessation is not caused, so it is never unavailable, it is just that we <em>have</em> things in the way or <em>put</em> things in the way of its unfolding.</p>
<p>Saying that the Buddha urged people to work toward cessation of suffering is correct, but it is splitting hairs. (Even at that, some take issue with translating <em>dukkha</em> as "suffering".) Cessation <em>is</em> happiness and fulfillment, though it may not be like the common person's view of happiness, which is more like joy or good feeling.</p>
<p>In any case, the Buddha taught both short-term and long-term happiness.</p>
<p>In the <em>Kalama Sutta</em>, happiness is mentioned repeatedly:</p>
<p>&gt;...these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness' â€” then you should enter &amp; remain in them</p>
<p>(three times)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&gt;...all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness</p>
<p>(three times)</p>
<p>In the <em>Alagaddupama Sutta</em>, "long-term welfare &amp; happiness" appears seven times.</p>
<p>"Happiness" is riddled through various sutras, along with references to unbinding, abiding in ease, avoiding misfortune, going beyond the Evil One's range, living the holy life, creating and enjoying concord, pleasant abiding, neither-pleasure-nor-pain, being developed in body and mind, being self-awakened, attaining great fruit and reward, joy, and even the rapture of composure. Some of these express stages along the path, others express the end goal. But they are all related to the cessation of <em>dukkha</em>. The important thing is not which words point to the path and goal, but to actually travel the path and attain the goal.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>And, if you read to the end of the sutta, you see that they end up becoming Buddhists and going for refuge in the three jewels. In other words, they embrace Buddhism.</em></p>
<p>They take the three refuges, which some of us <em>call</em> becoming Buddhists. Some may say that equates to becoming Buddhist, some may say it doesn't. But at that time, I don't imagine the Buddha said "good, now you are Buddhists", and I don't imagine the Kalamas said "yahoo, now we are Buddhists". You want to call that Buddhism, and that's fine. Does it add anything to the account of the Kalamas taking the refuges?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Or, more properly-- we grasp to the dharma until we reach the far shore. Once we reach nirvaá¹‡a, we have no longer need for the dharma. But while we are midstream, we definitely should be gripping tightly to the raft.</em></p>
<p>Yes, that's what I was saying. Isn't that what I said? In the next paragraph I bring attention to the need to <em>grasp the Dharmas and cleave to form</em>. No argument here.</p>
<p>So what is understood as the "raft"? Not only form, not only non-form. (And some of us make non-form into a form to be pursued, so not that either.) Gripping tightly to good teaching requires releasing the grip on unreal forms. Gripping tightly to the raft doesn't mean that I have to hold on to something because it is called <em>Buddhist</em>; it means I have to let go of ignorance, allowing myself to be guided by wisdom that may come my way from any corner â€” guided because I have the discernment to see that it is wise.</p>
<p>If practice is conceived of as holding opinions, putting trust in verbal definitions, or belonging to a big spiritual club, that form has to be abandoned even before reaching the other shore. That is a raft that is not heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that "other shore" is an <em>upaya</em>. You don't actually go anywhere else and you don't step into another place to get deliverance.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Converse, and practice.</em></p>
<p>My practice doesn't depend on the Buddha's words, and it doesn't depend on being part of a movement named Buddhism.</p>
<p>Similes are only similes, words are only words. What is the essential point? The Buddha didn't wake up to an argument or definition, He saw a star.</p>
<p>Thank you for the conversation.</p>
