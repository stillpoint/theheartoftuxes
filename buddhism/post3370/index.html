  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong>
...(continued from Part 1)</p>
<p>&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the nuns of the Western temple had a problem. All day they talked about the meeting that they would soon have with the nuns of the Eastern temple. “What can we do?” one nun thought they should approach the Zen master before the meeting to get his opinion. “But how can we ask him?” They were thinking, thinking, trying to come up with a good idea. Then one nun spoke up. “I understand this Zen master’s mind.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, what kind of mind does he have?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Our Zen master’s good friend is Zen Master Such-and Such. He is also my friend. So I know they both like noodles!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Noodles?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yah, noodles. We can make some special noodles, and carry them up to him tonight. Then can ask hi whether Kwan Se-oom Bosal is correct!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, that’s a good idea!” the nuns said. “We must ask him before the other nuns do.” So the nuns of the Western temple started to make very special noodles for the Zen master. Now, making noodles is not easy. It takes a long time. Making rice is simple, but noodles are very difficult to prepare. You must first prepare rice powder, and roll it out, and then carefully slice the noodles, one by one. Then you can only throw the noodles in the broth right before they are served, or else they’ll get too soggy, and there’s not such a good taste. It was very late by the time finished. Then two senior nuns were selected to bring the noodles up the mountain to the Zen master. He is an old monk, so he doesn’t sleep so much. Old monks sleep a little in the day time, but night they sleep so much, you don’t know? [Laughter.]
&gt; 
&gt; KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!
&gt; 
&gt; “Who is it?” Came a voice from the other side of the door.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, we are from the Western nuns’ temple.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, it’s a almost midnight! What is wrong? Come in, come in.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yes, um --- sir, there was a very big memorial ceremony at our temple tonight.” In Korea, when someone dies, the family will have a memorial ceremony. These ceremonies sometimes take place at night. “We had this big ceremony, and made lots of noodles. Now we think about you, up here on the mountain with nothing to eat. Zen Master, you like noodles?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, yes! I like noodles!” [Loud laughter from the audience.]
&gt; 
&gt; In Korea, there is a saying: “Rice stomach, cake stomach, noodle stomach, and wine stomach are all different.” Different people like different things better than other. But this Zen master wasn’t like that. It seemed like he could eat anything. “Oh, I like noodles! That’s wonderful!” He slurped them down in a delicious frenzy. Very good taste! “Oh, wonderful noodles. Thank you very much for your hard work! You think about me, so I am so lucky!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, no problem, no problem, sir. You are welcome.” The nuns were beside themselves with glee that soon they would certainly win the argument. Also this Zen Master was very happy. The nuns waited a few more minutes and then one of them said, “Zen master, we have a question…”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, what kind of question? Ask me anything. No problem.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, our nuns say ‘Kwan Se-oom Bosal,’ but the nuns of the Eastern temple say ‘Kwan Se-um Bosal.’ Zen master, ‘oom’ is correct?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course! ‘oom’ is correct.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, thank you very much! Now we understand why you are a great Zen master. Tomorrow morning at eleven o’clock, we all want to meet with you so you can decide. So at that time you will say that Kwan Se-oom Bosal is correct?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course! Kwan Se-oom Bosal is correct.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, thank you! Thank you!” They were very happy and relieved. They bowed at the door and left. They practically ran down the steep mountain to bring the news to the others. When they got back to the Western temple and told their dharma sisters what the Zen master had said, everyone shouted, “Waah, we win! We win! We win! The Zenmaster said we are correct!” Everybody was very happy. Then they all went to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; The next morning at eleven o’clock, the great temple bells were struck in each temple. Five hundred must gathered in Main Buddha Hall to bring the matter to the great Zen Master Hak Un. He climbed onto the high rostrum and adjusted his long ceremonial robes. All together, the five hundred nuns did there full prostrations to the Zen master. Then two senior nuns appeared, one from each temple. One nun said, “Zen Master, yesterday we all had an argument. We believe that Kwan Se-um Bosal is correct!”
&gt; 
&gt; “No, no! Kwan Se-oom Bosal is correct,” insisted the other.
&gt; 
&gt; “Kwan Se-um Bosal!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Kwan Se-oom Bosal!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, we cannot decide anything. So we all want to ask you. Which one is correct: Kwan Se-um Bosal or Kwan Se-oom Bosal?”
&gt; 
&gt; The Zen master closed his eyes for a few moments. His body bobbed back and forth ever so slightly in his seat on the high rostrum, pondering their profound question. Many of the nuns learned forward, anxious to hear what he would say about this great matter. After a long time, he slowly said to the assembly, “This is a very difficult question!” [Laughter from the audience.]
&gt; 
&gt; “What do you mean, difficult? Yesterday we talked about Kwan Se-un Bosal being correct…”
&gt; 
&gt; Other nuns said, “But, sir, you said ---”
&gt; 
&gt; The Zen master remained silent for a moment, his eyes still closed. “Buts it is very easy…”
&gt; 
&gt; Each group of nuns heaved a sigh of relief. “Oh, it’s very easy!” Each group thought to themselves. “We will be correct after all!”
&gt; 
&gt; He said, “A long time ago, when I was a young monk, I studied the most profound sutras of our tradition. The Rice Cake Sutra says Kwan Se-um Bosal is correct. But the Great Noodles Sutra say Kwan Se-oom Bosal is correct!” [Loud, sustained laughter from the audience.]
&gt; 
&gt; The nuns started arguing with each other. “You made rice cakes for the Zen master! You’re no good!”
&gt; 
&gt; “You gave him noodle! That’s low class!”
&gt; 
&gt; “You’re no good!”
&gt; 
&gt; “You’re no good!!” Back and forth, back and forth. Thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. Checking, checking, checking, checking.
&gt; 
&gt; Suddenly the Zen master shouted, “KAAAAAAATZ!! Put it all down! Kwan Se-um Bosal is Kwan se-um Bosal. Kwan Se-oom Bosal is Kwan Se-oom Bosal. When you’re chanting, only do it!”
&gt; 
&gt; The nuns were very shocked. Instantly their minds became clear. “Oh, thank you very much!”
&gt; 
&gt; ‘Thank you very much for your teaching!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Don’t attach to speech and words,” the Zen master continued. “Only do it!” Then he got down off the high rostrum and went back up the mountain.</p>
