  <h1>Developing a child's mind/contentment</h1>

<p>I'm sure you're right that the emotional baggage contributes to your mental patterns of sloth, torpor, and anxiety. Either you have to come to terms with the emotional baggage, little by little, or it will continue to control you.</p>
<p>Practical ideas for coming to terms with the emotional life? You need to find a way into your emotions that is safe and workable. 'Safe' doesn't mean you don't feel anything; it doesn't mean you don't break down; it doesn't mean you're never confused or at a loss. 'Safe' means you can come out of the experience without harm to your psyche — ideally, more real and sane than when you went in.</p>
<p>My suggestion: express yourself!</p>
<p>What is a good style of expression for you? There are many possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual art</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Writing poetry or free writing</li>
<li>Writing stories</li>
<li>Writing a journal</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Acting or performance art</li>
</ul>
<p>These are ways of engaging with your emotional life and transforming your wounds. Rather than running away from the emotions, as sloth, torpor, and anxiety do, you <em>lean into</em> them; but not for no reason — not without a productive movement. The expression transforms the wound into art, into something creative and alive and real. The emotion that previously only held negative possibility can now have a flow that leads to renewal.</p>
<p>Besides an artistic form of expression, sometimes just crying or having a laugh or yelling into a pillow can start things flowing. You can do this if you don't get swallowed up in the emotion. Express it, and then move on. Often people <em>regenerate</em> the sadness or anger, for instance, and become more and more negative; or they don't return from the laughter, and become manic. A form gives you a better chance to keep your focus and then end the session and move on to something else.</p>
<p>To let these things go, first you have to accept them. In the physical arts, we say you have to <em>embody</em> it. Take it on, dance it out, and then you can move on. You can move on because you've given that little part of you its voice.</p>
<p>If you ever read the Avatamsaka Sutra, there are many, many pages that read like a sort of superhero roll-call. Great being after great being is named, with these amazing descriptive names like <em>Nonregressing Courage</em>, <em>Myriad Subtle Pure Lights</em>, <em>Admirable Mindfulness</em>, <em>Banner of Inexhaustible Wisdom and Virtue</em>, and on and on. Each great being's name reflects his/her exceptional ability and blessing.</p>
<p>But what's very interesting for us who are struggling is that these names and abilities and blessings originally come from these beings' own struggle. The problem they had in life was the gateway to their liberation. Someone who had a problem with distraction was liberated through mindfulness. Someone who had a problem with lust was liberated through purity. Someone who had a problem with fear was liberated through courage. And so on....</p>
<p>So your wounds can actually be your gateway to liberation, if you <em>practice</em>. You already know: if you keep running away, you will keep going around and around in the same pattern. You know this; you can see it in your life. Same reaction, same result. But if you turn around against the usual stream you can start to transform your patterns.</p>
<p>There are infinite ways of expressing yourself. Besides the above list, many spiritual and shamanic practices work with emotional wounds. When you start to express yourself, you find that you are no longer behind in the process, but ahead of it, leading it. You are no longer reacting; you are at the lead of your life.</p>
<p>In more rare cirumstances someone's pain may be too much to even start looking into. If working with emotional wounds directly is too painful, and if you don't find support like a mentor, counsellor, or therapist, you can still express yourself through your daily activity by throwing yourself into work, athletics, relationship, simple tasks. Physicality is a big help; using the whole bodymind and breath together helps digest emotions. (That's why free dance is like the king of expressive arts: it can integrate every aspect of self, the physical, the emotional, the mental, the spiritual, the relational, the energetic.)</p>
<p>In terms of meditation, Unknowing digests experience. Too much checking, doing, and manipulating makes a problem for many meditators. Sitting in an ungrasping but aware state is what digests your life and makes it into wisdom. This can be practiced with a form and object of meditation, or without much form and without an object; but it's essential to incorporate both the ungrasping (or openhanded) attitude and the awareness.</p>
<p>As to Beginner's Mind, you have to generate that yourself. Once you get into a flow (by expressing yourself... or maybe by falling in love) it can be easier; but essentially it is your task to bring forth your Beginner's Mind. You apply your own interest, curiosity, fascination, awe, humility, aspiration, innocence. You apply that attitude to each situation. As you bring it forth it becomes stronger; but it's up to you to bring it forth.</p>
