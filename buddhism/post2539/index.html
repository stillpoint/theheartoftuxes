  <h1>This ego is very strong, what should be done?</h1>

<p>Public transportation is no problem. I've never owned a car myself, and have found ways to travel to teachers.</p>
<p>If you have to save money until you have enough to travel, that's no problem; save up, and then go for it.</p>
<p>If you need to find a job, or a new job, to get the money to travel to a teacher, that's no problem; just do it.</p>
<p>If you can manage to get to a practice group on your own a couple of times you may hook up with someone in your area who drives in to practice meetings and teachings.</p>
<p>An hour is not a long time to travel for the Dharma. In the old days, people would <em>walk</em> for days and weeks just to hear a single teaching. If you don't make it a problem, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>As above, if you have to save up in order to attend retreats, try. If you need to do some odd jobs telemarketing or posting flyers, no problem. Many centers will give a discount or full scholarship if you are willing to do a work-study exchange.</p>
<p>If you really can't do a retreat, do a workshop. If you can't do a workshop, attend regular member sittings. If you can't attend member sittings, go to free events. Do whatever you can to bring yourself closer to the Dharma and to its vessels, the precious teachers.</p>
<p>What borough or area of New York are you in? I or other Buddhitors may be able to help you with recommendations.</p>
<p>I met my teacher by trying, trying, trying. I visited many centers, practiced with many teachers. Sometimes the situation was uncomfortable or strange; but it was always beneficial. It was great to learn how many different approaches there are, and how Truth can be conveyed in so many different styles.</p>
<p>I asked around. I did research. At that time, there was no Google or online forum, so you have an advantage over me. Eventually, a friend of an acquaintance of someone I was staying with gave me a recommendation. It happened to have a connection to a center I had originally visited in my home town. When I arrived at the recommended center, I very quickly realized it was like home for me; the style fit, I trusted the teachers, and although the practice was new to me nothing in the teaching went contrary to my values.</p>
<p>But that's not to say that all the other places I visited would have been wrong for me. I acknowledge my own stubbornness and attachment to opinion. That is what we have to cut off; and if I had persisted in training with any of a number of teachers, I'm sure I could have gone far.</p>
<p>Some people find one teacher and persist. Others have to hop around a lot before they settle. We can't say that the hopping around is bad or even that it's worse than persisting with one teacher. Once a person connects with his or her own true motivation, everything up to that point becomes worth it.</p>
<p>I have had the great fortune to study with many magnificent masters, as well as with many very dedicated practitioners. Both are unique gifts. Both reflect the possibility of our own inner dedication and our own inner master, and their emergence. The enlightened one is already you; but you need the living example so you can come to know it.</p>
<p>As to judging your teacher, there are good resources online for how to choose a teacher. But really, you clarify the point through your own practice. If you don't make a sincere effort, you will never know whether your teacher is right or wrong. But your own sincere effort can make even a less capable teacher into a great teacher.</p>
<p>If you take a step forward, the Dharma will take two steps forward to meet you. If you don't take a step, don't expect any response.</p>
