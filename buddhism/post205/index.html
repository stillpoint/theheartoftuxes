  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>As far as I understand it you're supposed to realize that you are in the ant colony, and you don't matter, the colony does, because you're really the colony. Correct?</em></p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>That doesn't reflect Buddhist view and teaching at all.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>What we might call the 'western approach' — which is very ingrained, very habitual — is to consider a theory, a concept, and try to fit experience into it. This is the approach you are taking. It is not the approach of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Buddhism says "Don't prejudge; don't decide so quickly. Look...."</p>
<p>So there's no philosophy or way of thinking you're "supposed to realize". What you're invited to perceive or realize is the plain truth, the world as-it-is. So it requires the mental discipline of shedding favored opinions and habitual ways of seeing, and returning to <em>looking... looking... looking....</em></p>
<p>It is not conceptual; it is participatory. You trade your idea for real experience.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I have recently gone through a physical change that has been very tough for me.</em></p>
<p>&gt;...<em>By saying that I am the cause of the pain because it is due to an illusion is almost like saying "don't worry, this pain isn't real, nothing is."</em></p>
<p>This is the same 'western' approach, the same habitual way of engaging through theory and philosophy rather than direct experience.</p>
<p>The issue isn't whether we <em>say</em> "that's just an illusion"; because, as you already know, just saying it doesn't help. The crux of the matter is <em>can you actually wake up from the illusion</em>? This is a very different matter.</p>
<p>&gt;So at the time when Buddha was alive, someone else was contemplating exactly these kinds of questions. "What does that mean, 'illusion'? Can you really be free of suffering, or is it just a religious pipe dream? What's the difference between the Buddha and me?"</p>
<p>&gt;This person saw that the Buddha always was joyful and content, and always carried himself with compassion and nobility. It made him wonder whether there was some trick or secret, or whether the Buddha had some kind of superhuman ability.</p>
<p>&gt;So he approached the Buddha and asked, "Sir, we all seem to get sick and injured and feel pain; but you seem to be immune. Do you experience pain?"</p>
<p>&gt;And the Buddha replied, "Yes, I experience pain. But I don't get the <em>second</em> arrow."</p>
<p>Do you understand — do you grasp the meaning of the second arrow?</p>
<p>A very clear person, a person without illusion, is not immune to life. Life for them still has gain and loss, pain, illness, aging, and death. That is the 'first arrow'. But they don't get the <em>second</em> arrow, which is the thought "Oh, alas, poor me! <em>I am in pain!</em>"</p>
<p>That is, for a clear person, pain is just truth. For the rest of us, we make pain into our problem.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Now, once again, just hearing or reading this can't help you. You may or may not believe it; but even if you believe it, it can't help you. You have to <em>attain</em> it; and that's about participating, not thinking.</p>
<p>You want everything explained for you before you take a step to help yourself. That's simply fear. You might have the idea that it's reasonable skepticism or some such notion; but in fact it's only fear. Many people think the same way. Fine, you are allowed to have that attitude. But that attitude forms a cause; and the effect of that cause is that you don't improve, you don't ever move through and out of your problem.</p>
<p>&gt;So the Buddha also spoke very directly to this attitude:  <br />
"It is like a man shot with a poison arrow, who goes to the doctor to have the arrow removed; but before it is removed, the man wants to know what kind of arrow it is, shot from what kind of bow, and from what person, and for what reason...."</p>
<p>&gt;And, and, and.... Well, of course the man dies from the poison. He was so intent on his demands for explanation that he never got to the main point, which was <strong>to remove the arrow</strong>.</p>
<p>The Buddha spoke precisely to your situation and mindset. If you want relief, you have to take steps. If you want only explanation — to try to coddle and comfort yourself with more and more words and concepts — you're free to proceed. It just means you will never get around to removing the arrow.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One final teaching: the great Zen scholar Daisetz Suzuki once said "Freedom is that the elbow doesn't bend outward."</p>
<p>This is a very beautiful, magnificent teaching. It puts the finger on the way we habitually engage with life — the Samsaric cycle we constantly regenerate.</p>
<p>We're always looking 'for our elbows to bend outward'; that is, we're always looking for things to be as they are not. We want a better situation, we want to get rid of what we don't like, we want to get more of what we like, we want our unpalatable history to be different than it is. You want your physical change to be magically reversed. Wanting, wanting... Wishing, wishing... Always looking for something other than <em>what is</em>.</p>
<p>But we forget about our capacity for contentment and joy. We neglect the mind that is unconditionally satisfied and unconditionally loving. So that capacity atrophies and recedes.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches the path of being on good terms <em>with reality</em>, not trying to force our fantasy to happen. The world is full of people trying to get <em>their</em> favorite dream or idea. The million ways we put ourselves ahead of all others; and the million ways we neglect our original nobility and contentment. Corrupt politicians, dastardly businesspeople, neighbors without integrity, colonists and terrorists and genocidal cadres — all of whom think that <em>their</em> way is the best way. So this one mistake creates incredible suffering for the whole world.</p>
<p>If you are willing to take steps, you can turn that around. It is completely up to you whether you do it or not. There is guidance, teaching, companionship, and all kinds of help; but it is completely up to you whether you try.</p>
