  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; Are you Tibetan? There's obviously nothing wrong with that, but it means that I don't think we'll never come to an agreement. </p>
<p>ಠ_ಠ</p>
<p>Is this racist, or just very specifically pessimistic?</p>
<p>Shall we not try?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I've always been taught that Gautama was indeed a person</em></p>
<p>Yes. This is the distinction. Gautama was a person; but then he completely freed himself from identification with personhood, and from limitation from form (including physicality), and from every trace of cause leading to becoming any kind of being. If you want to call that Buddha Nature, I have no problem with that (see? we're agreeing!).</p>
<p>'Buddha' refers to one who has attained these things, one who has forever cast off all becoming, and is no longer any kind of 'being'.</p>
<p>Even a lower-class enlightened being who has attained the Sambhogakaya is no longer limited to human form, and can manifest countless different forms. Sometimes as human-like apparitions, sometimes in physical form, sometimes as other beings, sometimes as light or pure blessing, sometimes as music or landscape.</p>
<p>When Sariputra challenged a female deva as to why she couldn't overcome her feminine form (assuming that it was inferior to a male form), she manifested as male <em>and manifested Sariputra as female!</em> This is only a deva, not even yet a Buddha.</p>
<p>You are still conceiving of Buddha as someone stuck in a human form. That is not Dharma; that is your own limited conception — <em>mis</em>conception. You are still trying to conceive of Buddha within what <em>you</em> understand as a being. Do you think that is what your Zen teachers are teaching you? No, I am confident they are pointing you beyond conception, beyond ideas of being. So why don't you go there?</p>
<p>In the Zen tradition, the first Zen transmission is considered to be Mahakashyapa's attainment of the Flower Sermon. Since you are involved in the great tradition of Soto Zen, here is an account of Buddha's last act of Zen transmission to Mahakashyapa, for your consideration. If we let go of our conception of being, this should clarify the matter at hand:</p>
<p>&gt;There were two sala trees on the hill near the Hiranyavati River. The Buddha entered nirvana under the twin trees. Deeply saddened, disciples of the Buddha were in condolences and sacredly preserved the body of the Buddha in a coffin under the trees. When Mahakashyapa came back from his Dharma journey, he was so devastated to know that he was not there for the Buddha’s last moments. Circumambulating seven times clockwise, Mahakashyapa lamented with his eyes full of tears. At that very moment, with great compassion, the Buddha pushed out his feet and showed thousand-spoked wheel of Dharma sign on the feet to Mahakashyapa.</p>
<p>The author of <em>Introduction To Ganhwa Seon</em> continues:</p>
<p>&gt;It is in this vein that Great Master Seosan said, “Anyone overly attached to words will make the Buddha’s flower or Mahakashyapa’s smile mere pale traces of doctrine, while those who get the true message through mind will make even trivial worldly talks the essence of Seon beyond doctrine.”</p>
<p>Your spiritual ancestor, Zen Master Dogen has this to say about Sakyamuni Buddha:</p>
<p>&gt;Truly you should know that although Sakyamuni the person endeavors at this moment to liberate sentient beings, Sakyamuni of the Tusita Heaven is now transforming heavens. The student of Buddhism should understand that, while Sakyamuni the person has an infinite variety of expressions, activities, and sermons, they constitute glowing lights and auspicious signs in the human realm which is just one corner [of the universe]. Do not be foolish enough to fail to see an infinite variety of edifying activity on the part of Sakyamuni of the Tusita Heaven.</p>
<p>&gt;– <em>Awesome Presence Of Active Buddhas</em></p>
<p>And on a Buddha's attainment:</p>
<p>&gt;Water is not forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables, or mind-objects. But water as earth, water, fire, wind, and space realizes itself. For this reason, it is difficult to say who is creating this land and palace right now or how such things are being created. To say that the world is resting on the wheel of space or on the wheel of wind is not the truth of the self or the truth of others. Such a statement is based only on a small view. People speak this way because they think that it must be impossible to exist without having a place on which to rest.</p>
<p>&gt;— <em>Shobogenzo, Sansuikyo</em></p>
<p><strong>"People speak this way because they think that it must be impossible to exist without having a place on which to rest."</strong> This is the same issue, of someone trying to conceive of the inconceivable, because they need some place to rest, some concept to hang on to. So they conceive of Buddha according to their own limited human view; when the reality is not at all limited in that way.</p>
<p>I invite you, along with me and all others, to let go of trying to be right and trying to hold an understanding, and to actually enter the inconceivable domain of Buddha by shutting the mouth and putting down all conceptions.</p>
