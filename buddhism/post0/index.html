  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There are probably very few people here who <em>haven't</em> experienced romantic heartbreak and loss. And there's no-one here who hasn't experienced <em>some</em> kind of painful loss.</p>
<p>The loss that others have experienced can range from the death of a loved one to loss of a limb or organ, to sudden terminal diagnosis, to lifelong injury or disease that debilitates the body or mind, to rape, abuse, torture, and other forms of violence... just for starters. Although brokenheartedness can seem like the end of existence as you know it, if that's the worst thing that has happened to you, you've lived a charmed life.</p>
<p>In one sense, it <em>is</em> the end of the world as you know it. But every day is. Every change we go through is an end and a beginning. Without ends there are no beginnings. So life is movement, and moving on. Changing, changing, changing -- <em>we can't hold on to anything</em>.</p>
<p>So the Buddha taught that <em>nothing whatsoever is worthy of holding onto.</em></p>
<p>You are getting a direct and strong experience of the ever-changing, impermanent, ungraspable nature of life. You are experiencing the First Noble Truth of Buddhism, which is that there is no inherently satisfying object, relationship, or situation anywhere. You will get things you don't want; and you will lose things you do want; because everything, everything, comes and goes.</p>
<p>But the <em>relief</em> is the main point: how then do you get free of suffering? How do you rise above dependence on the coming and going? The Buddha and many great teachers teach these points (the Second, Third, and Fourth Noble Truths: why you suffer, the fact that you can go beyond your suffering, and what you have to do in order to go beyond suffering).</p>
<p>Your pain is not here because you love the other person. Love doesn't depend on having and holding. Your pain arises because you <em>attach</em> to the other person and require them to be or do something for you. That part is not love; that is self-centered clinging. You make the story "I need you", so you get the result of that story.</p>
<p>But love itself doesn't make that story. True love says only "I am here for you. In your arriving, in our time together, and in your departing, I support you and wish the best for you". You can choose to love so completely that the situation no longer centers around <em>you</em> and <em>your</em> dreams and desires. Your can allow your heart to remain soft and open -- as open as the sky... as open as space. Even as you feel your grief and disappointment, you can also intend spacious and unconditional love.</p>
<p>This is healing for the other person, because it doesn't force them in any way, but frees then to follow their own inner movements -- which is important! If we care about someone, we want them to be free, and we want them to trust what they feel inside and make decisions with integrity rather than feeling guilty or controlled. Love is giving someone back to themselves.</p>
<p>This is also healing for you, as it brings you back to the loving heart that doesn't depend on outside circumstances; it brings you back to your own completion and independence. And it is healing for others, because you become a source of love in the world rather than a source of self-centered anguish.</p>
<p>But there's a hidden cause for despair when we experience this kind of loss. We think that it's a tragedy, and that our overriding existence is grief, but there is a very powerful force <em>behind</em> this experience, and that is <em>fear</em>. When you've made the romantic story in your mind that you depend on someone else for your happiness, when the situation inevitably changes you get a shock, an experience of loss and change. You realize that you don't have what you thought you had, and that you aren't what you thought you were. This leaves you feeling groundless, not knowing what comes next, not knowing what to rely on. It's the basic nature of life: open, changing, ungraspable. It is possibility. It is freedom to do or be anything. So this experience is one of tremendous potential. But we are terrified of tremendous potential..we are afraid of our freedom, afraid of our own power to create our life. We are afraid of the responsibility it implies: that we ourselves bring all goodness or evil into the world.</p>
<p>And this fear is why we cling in the first place. You wouldn't have clung so strongly to this person if you had possessed <em>yourself</em> more fully. Imagining that a relationship would be your 'everything' was an unconscious strategy to avoid the freedom and openness of life. Now that you are very sensitive to life's openness, there is part of you that is terrified of it, and will do almost anything to avoid it, even going to drastic measures.</p>
<p>But how Buddha taught us -- and how he <em>saved</em> us -- is by leading us back to ourselves: <strong>we</strong> <strong><em>are</em></strong> <strong>the openness.</strong></p>
<p>Love is not something you lost, nor something you <em>ever</em> get or lose. Love is what you are. The purpose of relationship, both its gain and its loss, is to teach you that.</p>
<p>You are not a small, incapable being, having lost and being lost within a huge mystery. You are the mystery itself, all of it.</p>
<p>So rather than turning away from the pain and fear, and trying to avoid or end them, if you instead turn toward them and embrace them with open, loving, unconditional acceptance, then in that moment you return to your own power, your own vast, mysterious, unconditional nature.</p>
<p>&gt;You know the story of Nosferatu (Dracula)? The vampire 'loved' in a very clinging, controlling way. To him, that love was sincere; "I <em>want</em> you, I <em>need</em> you, I'm <em>hungry</em> for you!" But of course, it was all about him and his wanting, not about what the girl wanted.</p>
<p>&gt;So Nosferatu pursued, and the girl ran, and that made Nosferatu even more hungry and desperate; and it all became very dark and sinister. <em>He</em> thought he was sincere; but it was self-centered to the extreme.</p>
<p>&gt;And finally he cornered the girl in her bedroom and leaned over her to possess her, to eat her blood -- he wanted her that much.</p>
<p>&gt;But this time the girl didn't struggle or reject or run. She opened her arms and said "okay". "Okay, I love you."</p>
<p>&gt;And with that, Nosferatu dissipated into the atmosphere and disappeared.</p>
<p>&gt;We have Nosferatu in us -- this hunger, this wanting. It wants to consume others; and it torments <em>us</em>. But if we open our arms and say "Okay, whether I <em>get</em> or whether I <em>lose</em>, both are okay; I just love you", then the vampire dissipates. The darkness is replaced by light.</p>
<p>Saying "okay" with sincerity is a very courageous and loving gift to your loved one and yourself and all others. Saying "okay" is maturity and grace. Saying "okay" is your own Buddha-like mind, which embraces gain and loss equally.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The Buddha taught about Eight  Worldly Winds, eight parts of life that tend to blow us around and around because of our attachments. Freedom and relief from suffering come when we practice openhanded stability, essentially saying "okay" without chasing or running away from these parts of life:</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Worldly Winds are...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pleasure and Pain</strong>  <br />
<strong>Loss and Gain</strong>  <br />
<strong>Praise and Blame</strong>  <br />
<strong>Fame and Shame</strong>    </p>
<p>These aspects of life control us through our clinging and avoiding. The cure is to open the hands, open the heart, and say "okay" to all of it.</p>
<p>"Okay; please move freely, because I care about you more than I care about my wanting."</p>
<p>"Okay, sadness. Come in, and stay for a while if it is time for you to be here. Okay, fear. I see you and I feel you, and it's okay. I'm not going to stop being here with all of life."</p>
<p>Your original nature is already <em>okay</em>. From the beginningless beginning, it's what you are. It's just up to you whether you embody it or abandon it.</p>
<p>Wishing you courage to be as-is. </p>
