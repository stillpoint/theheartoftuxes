  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>That's great, good for you!</p>
<p>Consistent teaching is important. Those are wonderful books from wonderful teachers. Much of that sort of 'context' is meant to seep in over the long term, like tea steeping for a long time, intensifying in flavor. Although it may lack the nuts and bolts of practice ("...but what do I actually <em>do</em>?"), the perspective and attitude they offer, and even the rhythm of practice, are more important than we may think at first glance.</p>
<p>But reading from different sources often leads to confusion. They may have the same central point (though we can't assume even that), but they come from different lineages and cultures, they use different methods of teaching, they are presented by teachers who each have their own quality and method and language, and they may even be addressed to different audiences (e.g., beginners, versus experienced students, versus lineage students, versus scholars).</p>
<p>It seems that you are drawn to Zen, is that true, or are you interested in other Buddhist traditions?</p>
<p>I find that many books on Zen, and on Buddhism in general, don't include step-by-step instructions for practice. Maybe this is intentional, so the reader is required to actually go to a living source for that teaching. That can make sense, because there is <em>so much</em> critical information and <em>so much</em> opportunity for misunderstanding or incomplete learning. Even if you happen to gather all the right information, learning it in the right order is necessary. Being face-to-face with a teacher gives you inconceivable benefit.</p>
<p>Having said that, way back when I started practice I did learn first from a book, <a href="http://selfdefinition.org/zen/Philip-Kapleau-Three-Pillars-of-Zen.pdf"><em>The Three Pillars Of Zen</em></a> by Philip Kapleau. The meditation instructions are interspersed here between other commentaries, taken from retreat talks. So this again is not a clear, direct instruction but something teased out of a different kind of situation. The style offered is an American amalgam of Japanese Zen, with its own particular jargon and form.</p>
<p>It was wonderful at the time to have something to try; but it was only years later when I started studying with masters that I began to understand practice in a deeper and broader way. The living example of how a master goes about life and practice is also quite indispensable.</p>
<p>You might find that more actual how-to instruction is available online at Zen Center websites than in books. Here again, if you go this way I'd recommend choosing <em>one</em> method and trying it out consistently rather than trying to blend teachings or jump from one to the other. There's a saying that if you want to dig down to water it's better to dig one hole deeply than start a hundred different ones. For a beginner I'd say that it's important to get clear and familiar with one method, so you can actually get an experiential sense of what it is; but after some weeks or months you may also want to check what else is out there.</p>
<p>The great Zen Master Dogen gave <a href="http://zencare.org/meditation/instructions-for-zen-meditation/">detailed instructions</a> for sitting practice that are still used in many schools. For the 'what to actually do with my mind part', Dogen says little more than 'keep the fathomless state'. This is real Zen, not merely meditation. That's an important distinction in Dogen's lineage as well as other Zen lineages. To say 'the fathomless state' is not vague, though it may seem vague to those of us who attach to words. Since it is fathomless it is also nameless and beyond description. This is why it usually has to be pointed out in person rather than reached for through guessing. But some people seem to have a knack or intuition about it; they can trust the Unknowing that is revealed when all concepts are dropped in a moment. If you can do it, great. If not, you will need more structure and explanation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kwanumzen.org/?teaching=providence-zen-center-meditation-instruction">Here is a podcast of Zen meditation instructions</a> that might be useful since you can listen while you're doing it. The central point is the same fathomless state, but a bit more structure is offered around it.</p>
<p>Probably the most common Zen methods involve counting or following the breath. As in Kapleau's book, <a href="https://zmm.mro.org/teachings/meditation-instructions/">this instruction</a> follows some progression from counting-method to following-method. You might find the posture instructions useful, regardless of what other method you might choose.</p>
<p>Even within Zen, many more methods exist; and if you are interested in other traditions the range of methods fans out spectacularly. There are many ways. Find a good, proven traditional way, and only do it. Also, I would say that finding a good teacher is more important than seeking a perfect fit with the tradition or method.</p>
<p>Let's also note that <em>practice</em> means far, far more than just sitting meditation. The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/2000px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png">Wheel of Dharma, </a> representing the whole path of practice has a three-part symbol at its center, similar to the two-part yin-yang symbol. This represents the three categories of sila (discipline and ethical action), prajna (wisdom), and samadhi (loosely translated as the 'meditation' part of practice). How you go about life and how you think and relate to things are also absolutely essential, and work together with correct meditation to bring about awakening and liberation. These areas, too, you will learn by studying with a teacher and practicing with a community.</p>
<p>Can I or another Buddhitor help you find a teacher and sangha?</p>
