  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's not a matter of being 'required' to do it, as if some set of laws were being followed. It's a matter of cause and effect. What is the effect you seek? You need the cause that will make the desired effect appear.</p>
<p>Unease arises because of our mind's reactive habits. The habits will not go away by themselves; a new cause, a new habit has to be established.</p>
<p>For instance, if someone has a headache maybe they can take an Aspirin and it will feel better. If the headache is not a common occurrance and the person is otherwise healthy, this is possible. </p>
<p>But if the person soon gets another headache, and another, and another, and if the headaches keep coming back day after day, the Aspirin approach is no good. Taking that much Aspirin will harm the person and make his health worse and worse. It's necessary to find the cause of the headaches and correct it.</p>
<p>Likewise, if your anxiety or reactivity is unusual and you are otherwise very stable and calm, a little bit of calm breathing can bring you back to balance. No problem!</p>
<p>But if, like almost all of us, your reactive mind habit is easily triggered by outside situations, you need to find the cause of that habit and change it. If the cause is not addressed, the effect will continue, and you will always be pushed and pulled around by life, not free to follow correct action. This is the purpose of meditation: to clean the dysfunctional mind habit and return us to our original clarity. In that clarity we can then reflect wisdom: we can begin to see things as they really are.</p>
<p>There's a Zen saying about this point.</p>
<p>&gt;Small shout: small echo. Big shout: big echo.</p>
<p>If you only require a small result, a small cause is sufficient. If you require a great result, a great cause — great consistency, great effort, great relaxation — is necessary.</p>
<p>And if you require exceptional result like enlightenment, exceptional cause is necessary.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>So that brings us to the next point. If we establish that consistency is necessary, how can we achieve it? How can you help yourself be more consistent?</p>
<p>You say that your life and character are very changeable. Some of us are like that. Sometimes it's sort of constitutional, an aspect of one's type of body and mind. Sometimes it's the result of external circumstances like unstable living situation and disturbing influences which can range from too much time spent on electronic ('thinking') devices and gaming, to associating with dark or unbalanced people, to experiencing violent trauma, abuse, war, oppression, etc.</p>
<p>Quite often, one's character type tends to find and participate in outer situations that aggravate the tendency; so a changeable type tends to have unstable daily schedules, maybe eating and sleeping at irregular times, and so on. A stable/stagnant type may, in contrast, not have a lot of movement in life and may easily become dull and sluggish.</p>
<p>Some people are changeable like wind; some are irritable like fire; some are solid like earth. Few people are very balanced.</p>
<p>Being changeable can be a gift, but when taken to extremes it can be a problem. So changeable types of people help themselves by bringing stabilizing influences into their lives. Establishing a few daily routines can be very supportive, and in fact life-changing for many.</p>
<p>For you, maybe having a morning routine could be very healthy and helpful. Making a commitment to wake up at the same time every day, and having a very clear meditation practice to go to upon waking, can soon help you develop a sense of stability that may have seemed out of reach. And for spirituality — <em>awakening</em> — to be the basis of that stability is very, very auspicious, very beneficial and fortunate.</p>
<p>You don't have to do it as if you're burdened by a duty. You can do it out of the joy of pursuing the most important thing in life — something vital, thrilling, nourishing, uplifting.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>So this brings us to the question of motivation. <em>Why</em> meditate? How to develop real aspiration that has an energy of its own, rather than slavishly imposing behavior on ourselves without really understanding the reason for it.</p>
<p>In short, how do we get behind ourselves; how do we get our heart in it?</p>
<p>Clarifying life direction is all-important. Life is short! We could die tomorrow! Why do anything, as opposed to doing something else — why spend our time and effort on something? This needs to be clarified, to bring energy and consistency to our life and practice. Life without direction will wander aimlessly, and be subject to habit. It will always go up and down, up and down. Life with direction can be clear and meaningful, and can attain things that can only be attained with focused, consistent effort, like equanimity, independent joy, unconditional compassion, and deep wisdom.</p>
<p>Here's my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/4qej47/i_lost_my_motivation_how_do_i_bring_it_back/d4scc2v">previous post on motivation,</a> with several links to practices for clarifying, developing, and maintaining correct motivation.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/4vh1mr/how_to_deal_with_extreme_laziness_and_low/d5yd8mw">post on motivation</a> that includes suggestions for developing a morning routine. (It links to the above post.)</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Balancing your body and energy type (which sounds like it may be a 'changeable' type) is an aspect of practice available in traditional courses of training. If you connect with a Buddhist tradition and teacher, they will be able to address questions of lifestyle, appropriate schedule for your level, and all kinds of other details.</p>
<p>Outside of Buddhism, Yoga offers a great deal of knowledge and expertise in balancing tendencies. You might look into Yoga, Ayurveda, and especially Yoga Therapy if you are interested in bringing some stabilizing influences into your life.</p>
