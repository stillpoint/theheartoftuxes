  <h1>Laugh your way to enlightenment?</h1>

<p>I wonder if the leader's response, "Why not?", smacks of the flippant, frivolous attitude that sometimes becomes glorified in laughter groups. Of course, one sees benefit in becoming less serious, being able to go with the flow of things. But if it becomes an entrenched stance -- unable to respond with seriousness, or even plain directness -- it is just as much a trap. In short, these groups sometimes take their lighthearted perspective too seriously.</p>
<p>It depends on how it's practiced. Selfless joy is indeed liberative. It is one of the 'Divine Abidings': Mudita, shared joy.</p>
<p>Joy has a very powerful influence that is especially appropriate for our society in this day and age.</p>
<p>And joy can be one of the most direct ways to let go of our self-centered way of moving in the world. So laughing joy is a viable object of meditation, a situation that one may unify with.</p>
<p>But there's a difference between joy and mere laughter, which is just an energetic release. Crying, yelling, running a marathon, and drinking alcohol can also prompt release; it doesn't necessarily make them paths of liberation. Laughter practice can be contrived (as opposed to natural and sincere); and it can regenerate the sense of self ("<em>my</em> laughter", "look at how wonderful and special I am, being able to laugh like this", "oh what a fantastic feeling I get when I do this").</p>
<p>The nature of laughter is also quite ungrounded. It can fly off into a kind of group mania, not that different from other group dynamics like rock concerts, riots, and ecstatic festivals. This is perhaps the effect that users key on: the way in which ongoing shared laughter sweeps you away, takes your mind away. Personally, I see a lot of ego in it, among some people who practice laughing yoga, and I see a lot of attachment to pleasure. These are not foundations of liberation.</p>
<p>The shadow side of joy is flightiness -- an inability to stay grounded. Picture the stereotype of the 'ditzy blonde', giggling at everything, easily distracted, completely caught up in her own experience, unwilling and unable to focus or take something to heart: that's an example of the shadow side of joy.</p>
<p>The shadow side of joy becomes particularly insidious in spiritual contexts where people may indeed have quite a bit of depth, but they get attached to lightness, or to their own expansive and loving vision. The vision and feeling may indeed be very beautiful -- and this is what is so intoxicating and alluring to others -- but it doesn't see anything but its own way.</p>
<p>Check whether the 'lighthearted' laughter is just as lighthearted with <em>your</em> way of doing things, or with other possible ways and visions. If they are not trapped in the shadow of joy they should be able to adapt easily, accept different ways, change moods, and so on. But if they are stuck in the shadow of joy it is as if a veneer is over them. They will laugh and turn away, or vaguely disregard anything that is not their own vision of light. It can be easy to be convinced by someone else's joy; but is it <em>grounded</em>? Is it grounded in reality, or is it more about the person's own light and pleasant experience? Can it relate to many things, in many ways; or is it a one-trick pony?</p>
<p>In some ways, attachment to joy relates to the Deva realm, one of the six realms of rebirth. In the Deva realm, beings enjoy very beautiful and light-hearted lives, with all kinds of lovely possessions and situations. But it is not Dharma. The enjoyment of these things doesn't penetrate into the meaning of birth and death -- there isn't enough suffering to keep many Devas on the path. So after very long lives of pure and joyful living, it is possible for Devas to go straight to extreme suffering in hell, as in their lives they have not looked into the great question nor performed beneficial activities other than preserving their mutual niceness.</p>
<p>There may have been many people who have attained liberation through joy and laughter, or who experienced joy and laughter upon having a transformative experience. Maybe some of these people figured that laughter was the <em>cause</em> of the liberative event, which may or may not be true. But when laughter is then institutionalized as a path, it doesn't necessarily have the same basis as an event that arose spontaneously.</p>
<p>With the right direction behind it (Dharmic motivation, not merely given lip service, but embodied) laughter practice could be a very good way. My main questions, if you want to try it, would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a sense of self regenerated?</li>
<li>Is there attachment to pleasure, or to a particular state of mind?</li>
<li>Can one participate in release without losing touch with reality?</li>
<li>Are people's characters being changed for the better?</li>
<li>Is it open to other views (e.g., can it change easily to appropriate seriousness, appropriate anger, appropriate calmness); or is it stuck in a shadow?</li>
</ul>
