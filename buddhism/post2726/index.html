  <h1>How do you go from knowing what is right, to doing what is right?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>How to you go from knowing what is right to doing what is right?</em></p>
<p>Short answer: do it.</p>
<p>Doing it will bring those mature qualities forward in your being. Doing the right thing will teach you. Doing the right thing will gain the results of doing it, which will establish first-hand for you the benefit of doing the right thing (as opposed to leaving it as a vague and intellectual exercise).</p>
<p>If you know what is right, you must follow up on that. This is where you establish what your life is about — integrity?, or the pursuit of your own comfortable situation?</p>
<p>Your patterns are patterns for a reason: because you repeat them. The future can be predicted from your patterns if you never change. But if you live in the moment you can change in the moment; you can turn on a dime, going completely against what has come before. This shouldn't be conceived of as a fight against your history or mind. Actually, you don't <em>know</em> that you want to hurt her back; you only know that those thoughts appear. Then you make a story of those thoughts and buy into that story.</p>
<p>So <strong>just do it</strong>; and <strong>be momentary</strong>. That is where your right action is expressed. No need to make it into a fight against some idea of who you are and what is easy or hard for you; all of that is just thought-based illusion.</p>
<p>By the same token, you might need to consider whether you really know what is right, or whether the kernel of what is right has been built up into its <em>own</em> story. Yes, non-harm is right; but that doesn't mean you have to be a doormat for others, or that you can't communicate something clearly and assertively, or that you should never disengage or demand your own space. Sometimes these are the appropriate expressions of non-harm — a few expressions among infinite possibilities.</p>
<p>Many meditators and spiritual seekers don an <em>ego character</em> of the 'nice person'. Rather than following the situation, they act from their idea of what a good well-intending person should look like. This is not compassion. (It is what Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche deemed "idiot compassion.") Real compassion, real love includes everyone. No-one loses; no-one has a pound of flesh cut out in order to satisfy the other.</p>
<p>People in the grip of the 'nice person' ego character may jump the gun, offering the right thing at the wrong time. The niceness may be premature, coming before they have fully experienced their own hurt and anger, understood what parts of their being need protection, and set the boundaries necessary for that protection and subsequent correct relationship. It's not that anger is wrong. Anger is your being's experience of injustice and its movement toward protective or corrective action. If the anger is shut off or ignored, the protection and correction lose energy or fail completely. It's just that the anger must not be selfish; it must be experienced, but together with care for the other; it must be expressed, but non-violently.</p>
<p>In this way, anger gets expressed as clear, assertive (sometimes fierce) love.</p>
<p>So besides <em>just doing it</em> and <em>being momentary</em>, another aspect of right action is that it is <strong>uncontrived</strong>. The story-making nature of the mind doesn't play middle-man. If you maintain your integrity moment to moment, you will be able to respond well. So you don't pre-plan what you are going to react against, and you don't pre-plan what reaction you will try to quash. Instead you open your hands, let go of past and future, let go of rumination about the whole thing, and return to neutral, in the moment. It's like releasing your grip on a car's steering wheel after you have made a turn, so the car can return itself to its straight line.</p>
<p>In other words, don't think about what you will do in the future, but just keep returning to open-handedness. You put it all down... it comes back up in your thinking (and then in your gut, or throat, or head)... as soon as you notice, you again open your hands and put it all down... again... again... again.... This is always available to you. It is not difficult to do in a moment; it is a relief. Less than one second's worth of returning to neutral is required.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to mention a fourth aspect: <strong>being sincere</strong>. You already know, yourself, that the all-important difference is whether you actually care. Do you actually care, or are you <em>trying</em> to care? Sincere compassion needs to be trained, built up. And it <em>can</em> be trained and built up. Practices like <em>Metta</em> (lovingkindness) and *Tonglen (exchange of suffering) meditations, Non-Violent Communication, and prayer can all develop sincerity of the heart. But the basic practice is just to be sincere. Recollect sincerity, and try to make it your priority. If yesterday or a moment ago you acted without sincerity, quickly drop it and return to sincerity in this new moment.</p>
<p>͏</p>

<p>͏</p>
<p>Here is a Buddhist Prayer Of Forgiveness, found on many sites online, that you may want to recite or work with. At first rituals like recitation may seem empty; but through repetition the 'empty' ritual becomes a vessel for your sincere intent, and eventually the mere form of repetition can evoke deep, heartfelt involvement.</p>
<p>͏ </p>
<p>͏͏͏<strong>Prayer Of Forgiveness</strong></p>
<p>͏ </p>
<p>&gt;<strong>If I have harmed anyone in any way</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Either knowingly or unknowingly</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Through my own confusions</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I ask their forgiveness.</strong></p>
<p>͏</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>If anyone has harmed me in any way</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Either knowingly or unknowingly</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Through their own confusions</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I forgive them.</strong></p>
<p>͏ </p>
<p>&gt;<strong>And if there is a situation</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I am not yet ready to forgive</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I forgive myself for that.</strong></p>
<p>͏ </p>
<p>&gt;<strong>For all the ways that I harm myself,</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Negate, doubt, belittle myself,</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Judge or be unkind to myself</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Through my own confusions,</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I forgive myself.</strong></p>
