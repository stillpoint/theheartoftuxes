  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>...but there had to be a first time, don't you agree?</em></p>
<p>A first time for what?</p>
<p>Why does there have to be a first time?</p>
<p>It only <em>has to be</em> because you can't imagine otherwise. So in Buddhism, we are careful not to impose our own limited conception on reality. This is crucial if we are to learn, to advance in wisdom like the great awakened beings.</p>
<p>Actually, Buddhism is very practical. The Buddha, whose name means 'one who woke up', refused to talk about things like the origin of the universe. He realized that whether someone can know or not, and whether someone can explain to others what they might know about the origin of the universe — that doesn't actually matter. It doesn't have anything to do with our current, real-life predicament. It doesn't further us in getting free of endless cycles of dissatisfaction, reaction, aggression, avoidance, mistaken behavior, and all the enslaving results that follow from these.</p>
<p>So instead of speculating on that which we can't know (or, maybe, can't know at the moment), Buddha very kindly and very wisely keeps pointing us back to what we <em>can</em> and <em>must</em> influence right now: we need to wake up to our situation, understand our true self, and help ourselves and our world out of suffering.</p>
<p>It is as if we were in a burning building, without understanding that it's burning. Then we distract ourselves with TV and cell phones, and with the dramas of our life — what great or horrible thing happened at work, how our relationship is going, what we're dreaming of for the coming year, and so on — but all the while, the place where we are living is burning, burning!</p>
<p>So the Buddha comes in and says <strong>"Hey! This place is burning! You have to go!"</strong> And then he also offers the way out.</p>
<p>And Buddha is very generous! He doesn't only show one way out. If someone doesn't like one way, he offers another, and another. There are many ways; but the main thing is to wake up and escape the burning.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>How come there are differences?</em></p>
<p>There are differences, and there are similarities. If you are attached to thinking, then Hinduism and Buddhism are different and can't be reconciled. Not only that, but if you are attached to thinking, you can't use <em>either</em> one properly.</p>
<p>But if you cut off thinking, Hinduism is Hinduism, and Buddhism is Buddhism. Hinduism has Shiva the cosmic dancer; Buddhism has Buddha calling the Earth to witness. Not same, not different.</p>
<p>In my experience, if you <em>attain</em> where Buddhism points, then you can understand the real meaning of 'God'. Only understanding can't help you in that regard. Thinking can't reach it. But getting a direct experience with the help of an awakened teacher can put things in the right context.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...how do you know you are on the right path?</em></p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Originally, there is no 'right' or 'wrong'. We only use those words in relation to what we seek or expect. So if <em>you</em> are clear on your direction — if <em>you</em> know what you're on about, if <em>you</em> are clear on the most important point of life — then you can judge which paths and teachers and situations can help you progress toward or express that most important point.</p>
<p>I say "progress toward <em>or</em> express" because it's not a given that there actually is a path. 'Path' is another word we use just to help us talk about things; but if you cut off all thinking and return to present-moment reality, where is 'path'? There is only this momentary unfolding situation and your place in it.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you are clear moment to moment, what we call 'path' appears by itself: When you are standing in the summer sun and it is hot, you put on a hat. When there is important work to be done, you do it. When you are hungry, you feed yourself. And when someone else is hungry, you feed <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>These are the unfolding path, not because there is some rule or philosophy that says so, but because you are clear in the moment, having let go of preconception, having let go of fretting and clinging and being hurled here and there by habit — you have let go of the burning world.</p>
<p>This is where teaching and practice comes in. We need proper teaching and practice in order to overcome our strong, strong ignorance, selfishness, and habit — the things that keep us from being clear. So while some religions and philosophies depend on ideas of good and bad, Buddhism points to how you can be clear.</p>
<p>Therefore it may not matter so much whether Hinduism or Buddhism is 'better', since the main point isn't about good and bad. If you find a clear teacher, and if you find a situation that moves you toward clarity, helps you let go of selfishness and habit and attachment to concept, then maybe that is a good situation for you, regardless of its style or culture or name.</p>
<p>Later, later, when you get clear of the many trains of thought that now control you, you will be able to see better and decide between 'paths'. Right now, my sense is that your path has more to do with letting go of ideas that agitate you, and returning to the simple, real moment.</p>
<p>Where are your feet? What is happening in front of your face? What are the hands doing? Limit your attention and interest to this circle of moment-to-moment real life, and you will be able to attain limitless reality. Because only thought is limiting. If you attain the real moment, that is already limitless. That is already Buddha-mind, Tao, God, Allah, The Spirit That Moves Through All Things, Energy, and Original Mind.</p>
<p>Let go of speculation. Be simple and momentary. Keep letting go and keep returning to simplicity and momentariness. This unfolds your path. <em>You</em> don't do the unfolding. When you are clear in the moment, <em>that</em> unfolds the path by itself.</p>
