  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>How many enlightened individuals do you think there are?</p>
<p>Are you correct in your estimation, or not correct? Or is it just an idea?</p>
<p>Actually, you don't know.</p>
<p>If you look further into the Buddha's spiritual career you will find that there are many hundreds of previous lifetimes in which he (in the form of male or female human, or animal, or other being) performed countless extraordinarily generous, compassionate, integral acts. And before that were many thousands of lives of striving for truth, purifying faults, and struggling and suffering as karma was rectified. In short, before his 'single-lifetime' enlightenment, the Buddha went through innumerable lifetimes purifying obscurations (clearing out blocks to integrity and clear perceptions) and gathering great stores of merit, like piling up enormous mountains of spiritual wealth without squandering them.</p>
<p>I knew a man who was 6 years old when a friend of the family, a musician, happened to leave a musical instrument at his home. When the family and musician returned home, the 6 year old boy was playing songs on the instrument. Before he was a teenager, he was already arranging music for the church choir. His genius was obvious.</p>
<p>But if you leave an instrument with another 6 year old child, maybe they can't do anything with it. Why? It's a question of capacity. When previous cause meets present condition, result is produced. So this man had previous causes for musical genius, and they met the condition of the musical instrument being left at his home, and they produced the result of him becoming a great musician.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Buddha had tremendous, extraordinary previous causes amassed; and when he encountered the conditions that caused him to turn to spirituality (his privileged birth, and his encounter with sickness, old age, death, and the contemplative path), it produced the result of intense and sincere questioning, and eventual enlightenment.</p>
<p>Those with greater capacity can achieve the great. Those with lesser capacity will need to gather beneficial circumstances and develop their capacity.</p>
<p>The Buddha taught how capacity is developed: by giving generously, doing good and kind action, being patient and forbearing, making vigorous and happy effort, performing deep meditation, and participating in wisdom. These are just categories of activity. Much of Buddha's teaching points to the specific ways we can use our activity to develop capacity.</p>
<p>In the gradual and solitary path, it is recognized that this development may take many, many, many lifetimes. So there is tremendous patience, but also tremendous devotion. One keeps a mind that aims with focus a thousand lifetimes into the future.</p>
<p>In the broad path, time is not as much of an issue, and one aims at manifesting enlightened qualities from moment to moment and day to day, with the mind that sees all infinite beings waking up together.</p>
<p>In the path of transformation, life situations are used skilfully as a crucible to transform obscurations into benefits and gain merit (capacity) quickly. One keeps a mind that sees the inherent awakened quality of all phenomena.</p>
<p>So when you ask if it would be possible to read and meditate alone <em>assuming one puts in the work</em>, the key question is what 'putting in the work' entails. It is not the same for everyone. People of low capacity like most of us here won't even recognize what 'the work' is — our perception is still far too crude to even begin to discern what is required and what resources are at hand. Someone of higher capacity will not only be far more clear about what is useful or useless, but will be able to understand many of the subtleties of the teaching, and will even be able to perceive dimensions of great enlightened beings ready to teach and bless and help them along.</p>
<p>Are there states above awakening? The way we use the term, yes. Usually we use 'awakening' or 'enlightenment' to indicate anything from the first direct glimpse of our true nature to complete and perfect understanding of interbeing <em>and</em> complete and perfect freedom from all negative states, conditioning, and even latent tendencies. There is a <em>lot</em> of territory between those way-points; and the stories of great masters often include many distinct enlightenment experiences, or sometimes a continuous and hardly perceptible deepening.</p>
<p>It's not quite accurate to call these 'states', though. A state is a phenomenon or pattern or experience, something that comes and goes based on conditions. Enlightenment is really beyond condition; it doesn't depend on phenomena; it isn't a particular thing that you get. Maybe it's something like a mirror that is first covered, and then merely clouded, and then uncovered and clear: all kinds of phenomena can appear in the mirror — lovely and glorious, or simple and common, or horrific and gruesome — but the mirror's essence is beyond all of the coming and going. When the mirror is clear, reality is reflected; and the clarity doesn't depend on any of the stories that appear in the mirror.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's something like waking up from a dream. The waking up tells you that all of the forms and stories of the dream were made of dream-material, made of mind. Before you wake, your condition depends on the events of the dream; but when you wake up you are no longer dependent on anything that happens in the dream. It is no longer about the dream state: whether nice dream or nasty dream, it doesn't matter. You see.</p>
<p>So enlightenment is not actually caused. It is not a state. It is just a name that we give to the situation of no longer being clouded, no longer being in delusion about where all of these forms and images come from. Therefore there is no such thing as enlightenment; it only exists as a word. That's an important point.</p>
