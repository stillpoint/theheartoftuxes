  <h1>Maybe you guys can help me out. Advice on the origin of suffering?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I've been thinking a lot lately about how the origin of suffering is due to attachment, but I just can't seem to work it out in my brain.</em></p>
<p>What is it that you can't seem to work out?</p>
<p>Relational, romantic, and sexual attachment don't just get rooted out all of a sudden. They will be with you long-term, and your engagement with them will have to be long-term. You can't do anything about that right now. What you <em>can</em> do something about is the moment. You can have an appropriate, healthy, sane, beneficial relationship to the moment. And if you continue that, then the long-term issues will gradually be purified.</p>
<p>These kinds of difficulties are all part of natural process â€” karma. Countless past intentions and actions are now coming around as results, like fruits that are becoming ripe. Some of these intentions and actions you may be able to identify with hindsight, such as a blind spot you had or a bad decision you made early on in your relationship, or more generally looking for fulfillment outside of yourself. But many of the causes are hidden from your awareness or forgotten in the distant past. You can't do anything about the past causes, but you can steer the way they come to fruition and you can refrain from making more causes.</p>
<p>Changing the way karma comes to fruition, and refraining from making more causes, involve the same practice: compassionate, Way-seeking intent and clear, open-handed activity. Compassionate, Way-seeking intent means that you sincerely vow and sincerely try to let go of your own small-minded attitude, and instead use every situation to bring you closer to awakening. It also means that you offer your experience to others, for their benefit.</p>
<p>So, for example, your suffering can bring you closer to the issue: What suffers? Who is this "I" that I keep defending, keep needing to placate? Everything I try to grasp will eventually go away; where is one pure thing that doesn't go away?</p>
<p>But also realize that it is not only <em>your</em> issue, but a situation shared with your boyfriend, and with all the people you interact with. Indeed, it is part of human experience, and is a situation shared by all of us. We all know wanting. We all know loneliness. We all know loss. So compassionate, Way-seeking intent keeps this BIG mind. "This is not just my situation, it is a world situation. How can I help us all?"</p>
<p>To say it another way, at any moment you never reject any part of the world; at any moment, you embrace all of it. Easy time, embrace easy; difficult time, embrace difficult. No being or experience is rejected. Your heart is big enough to do this!</p>
<p>Next, clear, open-handed activity is the essential other part of the remedy. When you have "I", you are making karma, making causes of future unclear situations. When you have no "I", you have clear space, and your karma becomes more clear. This is meditation. It is also called "Unknowing" or "Stopping" or "Disappearing". In this clear space, old karma and present situations both get digested well. You will also experience that the noise of your thinking settles down and you can see your patterns more clearly; you see your own mind, your own karma, and you can change it.</p>
<p>So if you want to help yourself, you need a sincere and compassionate intent, and you need some moments of clarity. You can practice formal meditation, or you can practice letting go in a moment. Many activities can help: chanting and bowing are traditional; simple work and exercise can do well; yoga, taiji, and free dance can also be great. The main thing is to keep letting go, keep Unknowing.</p>
<p>For romantic attachment pain, I'll pass on a way that you can help yourself. Some shamanic practitioners talk about the lines of light that connect us, and maybe you can actually feel these connections in your belly â€” when you think longingly (or angrily or anxiously) of your ex-boyfriend you feel tension and disturbance in your belly. Well, any time your thoughts turn to your ex, consciously let go of those lines of connection. Let him return to himself, let yourself return to yourself. Letting go of those sticky lines will free you both to move harmoniously in the world. Every time your mind turns that way, let it go.</p>
<p>This practice doesn't require you to assume actual lines of connection, and it doesn't require visualization or sensation, although if those things help that's fine. What it requires is repeated letting-go. No drama, no second-guessing, just letting everything return to its natural place by itself. This is the same repeated letting-go that is the true power of meditation. If you continue endlessly, then eventually you will let go completely to things-as-they-are, which is reality, enlightenment, freedom.</p>
<p>But you mustn't require your mind or situation to be a certain way. You mustn't check and see if things are good or bad, better or worse. Your concern is only with the Way-seeking intent and the clear, open-handed activity of letting go. This establishes your right relationship with your heart, your mind, your life. Let it be as it is. This letting-be will become stronger and stronger, and then you will be able to take on <em>more</em> suffering. You will be able to enter the most difficult and terrible situations and help others with the strength of your letting-go.</p>
