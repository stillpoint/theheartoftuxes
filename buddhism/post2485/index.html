  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'm sorry you missed the point of my reply. Maybe I didn't express it clearly.</p>
<p>You're still talking about Samsara as if it's either a theory or an object. Again, Samsara is just a name that points out how you are using your mind right now.</p>
<p>For instance, you ask how you know that on the other side of Samsara is relief; but you don't ask how you know that relief is relief. You just use the word 'relief' to point to relief. That's the difference between Samsara or not-Samsara: the difference between stress or relief.</p>
<p>And, again, your misunderstanding and your stubborn <em>clinging</em> to it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. You see things the way you see them because you insist on continuing to see things the way you see them.</p>
<p>The teaching won't force its way into you, demanding occupancy. You have to make yourself a proper vessel for it.</p>
<p>And, again, all of this seemingly reasonable skepticism, this clinging cogitation and doubt, is rooted in your fear of the new. It's not that you have good reason to doubt the path; it's that you're afraid of looking into it and settling the matter, one way or the other.</p>
<p>"I can handle it myself" is a brave mask, but it's really the voice of fear, because it insists on isolation and rejection of anything that could actually transform your view and your life. So, as I say, you have every right to engage at whatever level you're comfortable with, but at any moment, <em>you</em> are either making Samsara or freeing yourself from it.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Seeking higher truth, higher teaching, improving your mind. That's still clinging, therefore still within the Samsara cycle is it not?</em></p>
<p>Yes. It's dualistic, a supposed self seeking what it supposedly needs.</p>
<p>But what you don't take into account is that you came here seeking something. So already you have Samsara. You just don't have it <em>in theory</em>. But in your everyday reality, you have it. And if you're honest with yourself you will acknowledge that you are often seeking and arranging and avoiding and ignoring. Already, you are deep, deep in Samsara.</p>
<p>The <em>idea</em> of relief can be an actual momentary relief. In that moment you can remember to let go. But just an idea can't help you in the long run. You don't live that way; and your blind spots continue to be blind spots, because there's no one there to reflect them back to you; there's only the owner of the blind spots, driving the bus and saying "never mind, I got this".</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I do not have access to a master I trust</em></p>
<p>Trust doesn't come in a package delivered by UPS. It's a negotiation of relationship. You reasonably start with limited trust, and then <em>you</em> take a step. The teacher's role isn't to kidnap you and force you to learn; you have to take a step. Then the teacher responds to you. You have some good times together, you have some bad times together, you gradually learn what is real and what is imagined, you gradually learn what part of your relationship is human and what part is absolute. Then, when you've got some experience to go on, you can take another step. Thus trust is built.</p>
<p>But everyone wants to show up at the door and ask for papers: "Before I try, give me proof that this is going to work!" That's not how it goes. First you do the thing, then you get the proof.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...enlightenment is just an illusion, an idea, why take it seriously?</em></p>
<p>The <em>concept</em> of enlightenment is illusion. And the <em>concept</em> of no-enlightenment is also illusion.</p>
<p>Enlightenment itself is just that which is not illusion. That which is beyond illusion, we <em>name</em> 'enlightenment'.</p>
<p>You still have wanting and need. You still have clinging and its harm to you and others. Soon you will die, and you haven't resolved the question of your life. So <em>for you</em> the issue is very serious. That doesn't mean dour. It can be light; it can be warm; it can be joyful. 'Serious' means that you, yourself, have a life-and-death issue on your hands, whether you look at it or whether you try to ignore it.</p>
<p>The Zen Masters you fleetingly skirt around without ever meeting -- sometimes they say that life has no meaning. For someone very attached to meaning, they use that teaching. Maybe for you, they will hit you and say, "Of course life has meaning! Don't you feel this hit?"</p>
<p>But one thing is very clear: Zen Masters have shown up for life in a very particular way, with exceptional devotion and exceptional bravery. They have given their lives to something, beyond names, beyond theories. Every moment of the day and night, they express it.</p>
<p>So if you're going to hearken to the words of Zen Masters, you also need to acknowledge the life and activity of Zen Masters. They are very, very, very serious about something. Dead serious -- though that doesn't mean without laughter and glee.</p>
<p>What is that thing about which they are serious? </p>
