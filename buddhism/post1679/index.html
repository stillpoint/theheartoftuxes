  <h1>Any suggestions for dealing with a passive-aggressive spouse?</h1>

<p>Communication, communication, communication. Most relationship difficulties, fights, resentments, irksome situations, and disappointments will be well-served through clear and ongoing communication, if not resolved altogether through it. At the very least, the issue will be brought to awareness so you're not dealing through unconscious habit or knee-jerk reaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, let's remember that your term is a sort of shorthand label, and that it's not the spouse who is (or may be) passive-aggressive, but rather <em>some</em> of his/her behavior. Liberate your spouse from your labeling and see him/her as a human reacting through a collection of needs and challenges, and he/she will feel the greater space and respect offered, and will be more disposed to spacious, respectful behavior toward you.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also not clear whether her/his behavior <em>is</em> passive-aggressive, or whether that's your own take, colored by your own blind spots and neuroses. Sometimes neutral, capable third-party help is in order; and in any case you should take every opportunity to consider your own slanted perspective. We tend to make ourselves the heroes or victims in our own stories rather than seeing shared cause and effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second, you should maintain your respectful, openhanded conduct regardless of what your spouse sends your way. It doesn't mean being a passive doormat, but neither does it mean trying to dominate through aggression or sending back unclear, passive-aggressive jabs. The alternative to aggression, passivity, and passive-aggression, is clarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your attitude and conduct are not solely driven by your spouse. Your reason for maintaining respectful neutrality is not only for her sake, but for the benefit of your own mind, for everyone you meet, and for all beings everywhere. In short, there is more at stake than just an isolated two-way exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than couching the situation in terms of sides, see it as a shared situation that you are working through together. Seek out a win-win solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>That means finding out what unmet needs are behind the unwanted behavior; and <em>that</em> means communicating. Each party should have the space to communicate their needs, or — if unaware of the needs — to explore what they may be without immediately being called to task or given a sob-story in response. This is not dueling banjos where each partner tries to show how hard-done-by they are. This is the conscious offering of care, interest, listening, and reflecting.</p>
<p>There are many sources that provide a framework for communication. If you like Buddhist style, check out Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings on relationship and family. If I recall correctly, his booklet <em>True Love</em> is one of his several teachings on the subject.</p>
<p>A simple framework is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a moment to let go and re-set together, being aware of the breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this moment of mindfulness, assert your presence "I am here."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, offer "Dear One, I am here with you, and I am happy to be here with you." You can add any specific caring thoughts, encouragements, and good wishes to make this statement more real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As needed, continue with "Dear One, I see that you are suffering, and I am here for you." Flesh out this sentiment with what you see and what you want to offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, you can communicate "Dear One, I am suffering; please help me (please be here for me)." Likewise, specify what is going on for you and what you need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another very useful framework is Non-Violent Communication (NVC). There are many free resources on the internet. NVC is based on the premise that when we understand each other's needs we naturally want to respond to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim for all of us is awakening and overcoming suffering. When a relationship difficulty is seen as part of the path of awakening, your relationship to it becomes quite different (as opposed to trying to get your own favorite situation). See yourselves, both of you, as already great awakened beings merely seeking to unfold your true nature. That will naturally give you the strength, patience, and will to persevere. You persevere in mindfulness, in respect, in nurturing your own and each other's awakening.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why it is very important for <em>you</em> to be clear with your spouse. It is your job both as a human and as a spouse to provide yourself and your spouse with the conditions for the unfolding of your awakening. You must not bear things that will keep your partner in the dark about his/her influence on the world; you must find clear and compassionate ways to bring cause and effect to light in your relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you expect greater clarity from your spouse, then you, of course, need to display greater clarity. Not just equal clarity, but greater: if you are calling her/him to move beyond old patterns, you have to show your willingness and effort to enter your own new territory. It will be easier for you in some areas, and easier for your spouse in some areas; you can each teach each other something. But <strong>the whole mandala unfolds from the center</strong>. That is, your entire situation, your entire world unfolds from the very center of your experience. Ultimately, that is what you take care of first and foremost. When <em>you</em> get clear, your mind's light can shine to others and help them to be clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>
