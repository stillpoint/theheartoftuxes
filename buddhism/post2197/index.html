  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I think there are enough sources, online and elsewhere, giving the basics of meditation. The question here is why you feel the need to associate yourself with an instructional article.</p>
<p>The title is very finalistic, suggesting that you are providing the one and only answer. Reading the title "How and Why to Meditate" and then clicking in to the article, it is profoundly disappointing to encounter, essentially, "I'm a beginner, and not qualified to teach or make recommendations, but here it goes anyway...." I mean, good that at least you own up to your level; but if you <em>really</em> owned up to it you might not make these kinds of suggestions at all.</p>
<p>The disclaimer "I'm a beginner" in the article, and the invitation for others to correct your mistakes amount to a shirking of your responsibility.  It is not good enough to just disclaim responsibility for what you share; if you're not sure of it yet (and you're not) keep the mouth closed and just do the practice. Likewise, it's not our job to pick up after you, correcting mistakes so that you can look as if you know something; it's up to you not to make the mess in the first place. Again, close the mouth and do the practice. If you're a beginner, be a beginner and do a beginner's job, which is to learn.</p>
<p>A beginner's job isn't to pose as someone who knows.</p>
<p>I much prefer the title "Why <em>I</em> meditate". Even that will, no doubt, change; but at least it doesn't pose or overreach. Because if the article is attempting to define the 'why' of meditation, it is quite shallow. The reasons you put forth are indeed positive and worthy, but in some paths they would be considered the absolute lowest among positive motivations. So it may turn out that your view will change and you will look back on this as a regrettable misstep.</p>
<p>The shame wouldn't come because people don't think much of your writing; it would come if people <em>do</em> think much of your writing, and take a shallow view because of it, missing the chance at greater purpose, writing off meditation, or performing it incorrectly based on your confused presentation.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that you will act on what I've said here. If you do, it would be a mark of laudable discernment and humility. But if you must share something online, here are my recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the finalistic, highfalutin title and substitute "Why <em>I</em> Meditate."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the 'how to meditate' part and instead just provide a link to an authorized teaching site with the same information. Give the teacher or teaching center the credit; don't try to look smarter by association. And don't pose as someone who has basis for recommending the method, as you haven't yet attained its full fruition and don't really know if it's <em>the</em> way, or the <em>best</em> way, or even a <em>good</em> way. You only know what you've experienced so far, which you can talk about if it's not done in a prideful way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut out all guidance, and talk only about yourself. If you are not basing the guidance you share on the qualified teachings of those who can actually vouch for it, you are playing a guessing game. And if you <em>are</em> basing your guidance on the teachings of others, you should forward students to them and stop posing as if its your own knowledge and expertise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Meditation can lead people to tremendous potential or great ruin; so you must have integrity, you must be responsible in your communication. But trust me, you don't want to start <em>taking responsibility</em> for others when you've only set foot on the path yourself.</p>
<p>&gt; A little learning is a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>The beginner trying to appear as the expert is such a common pattern it is a cliché. It has understandable origins in the somewhat giddy but ungrounded hopefulness a person encounters when starting out on a new and promising path. But its true makeup is ego, with two distinct expressions: fear of the unknown and dissatisfaction with the current situation.</p>
<p>The beginner, of course, is faced with not knowing. In any new teaching, we will come up against what we don't know. But rather than face and experience the truth of that, we try to compensate by using the bit of new knowledge we have gained to pump ourselves up. We 'make something special', we envision ourselves owning special powers or knowledges, we look for people we can feel superior around (more 'beginner' than us), we show off.</p>
<p>If you think about it, this pattern is really very similar to the toddler who, in all his incapacity and naiveté, shows off for mommy. I'm saying this as someone who went through these stages, both as a toddler and as a beginning meditator trying to look like an expert.</p>
<p>The beginner also has a somewhat unique situation of having just a tiny sliver of knowledge, but tremendous energy behind it — the energy of interest, curiosity, aspiration. The yearning to make progress, to go fast, can turn into its shadow side which is disrespect for present reality. We all struggle with the sense that <em>this</em> moment, <em>this</em> situation as-it-is, is not enough; but it's even easier for a beginner to fall into that mindset because of the strong hopeful energy pushing onward. It is at these times that the more experienced students and teachers have to remind the beginner to take care of his own steps. Watch where you're walking, don't try to be further up the path.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with your practice, there is no need to trumpet it. If you're trumpeting it, check your dissatisfaction: something is being avoided. We know this pattern from people who 'talk big'; it shows us that there is something not sitting right with them, something they are actually not confident about. So again, in your situation, close the mouth and do the practice. Attain the <em>basis</em> through experience in practice. Later, later, far down the road when you've taken care of your practice for some years and have been checked by teachers and given approval to teach, <em>then</em> you can say "I recommend such-and-such," or "I don't recommend such-and-such."</p>
