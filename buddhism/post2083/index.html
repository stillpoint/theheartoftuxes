  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There is a tradition in some Vajrayana schools (and perhaps other Buddhist schools) of covering images and shrines when they're not being used. This is also a tradition in Hinduism.</p>
<p>A Dzogchen master commented on this, saying that if you can keep your mind pure from moment to moment, it is no problem to keep the shrine open; but if you may sometimes expect negative thoughts and actions (as most of us will, since we slip into unconscious habit) you may want to cover the shrine to avoid the negative effect of doing bad action in front of an enlightened being.</p>
<p>Some will say that a statue is just a sculpted piece of wood or metal or plastic, and that it doesn't mean anything and you can do any action anywhere. But that is a narrow view. It is true, but narrow. The other side is that an image of Buddha is Buddha him/herself, and this land and your home and bedroom are a Buddha-land. This is also true.</p>
<p>One's view depends on one's perception, which is a matter of attainment. Great, attained beings actually see things as Buddha described on the moment of his enlightenment: "Ah! I see: everything has the nature of awakening!"</p>
<p>If you <em>only</em> think 'a statue is just a statue', then you must also admit a materialist view of self and world. This is one of the false polarities; the other polarity being that there is <em>no</em> material reality. But both eternalism and nihilism are false. If you put down all opinion, all making, then this mind and this moment and this place are all already Dharmakaya â€” perfect truth. That is the Middle Way of Buddhism, and the most important point in this discussion: to keep your own mind correctly, not adhering to either false polarity.</p>
<p>All enlightening beings already know your mind, the positive parts and the negative parts. So you don't really hide at any time, whether you pull a cover over your shrine or not. But our rituals and practices are not for the sake of enlightening beings. We are not protecting <em>them</em> from, say, shame; we are preserving <em>our</em> sense of appropriate self-respect and dignity.</p>
<p>Greater karmic repercussion â€” greater psychological effect â€” comes from willingly doing negative action in full awareness of the Dharma and in the full presence of one's witnesses (teachers and enlightening beings). So some may choose to cover images and shrines.</p>
<p>There is a parallel tradition of 'opening and closing' the shrine, either at the start and end of formal practices or at the start and end of the day. For example, water offerings are usually covered or emptied in the evening and refreshed in the morning. Different schools have different traditions in this regard. In my experience, this kind of practice tends to encourage a greater respect for practice, which is a good thing: one acknowledges the times one departs from practice; and eventually that may inspire one not to depart from practice at all.</p>
<p>If you aren't yet connected to a school or center, it's down to your personal relationship with practice and with enlightening beings. Some people have a different understanding of their witness. They try, in all sincerity, to maintain their practice continuously; and they feel deeply the compassionate presence of enlightening beings throughout the day, whether or not the person manages to maintain pure and attentive mind. In this case, keeping the shrine 'open' all the time is a signal and support for their continuous practice.</p>
<p>And there will be yet others who have a more rudimentary understanding of what is 'sacred'. Their relationship with the shrine and images is perhaps personally more vague, and thus depends on rules that they are given or that they imagine. In Buddhism this is not condemned, but seen as a phase within the great path. In this phase, sometimes sacred objects are 'just objects'; and only occasionally do they take on special meaning. The person goes in and out of practice: although they may have some experience of the sacred, they believe that 'sacred' only happens when they do certain special practices, or when they're in certain special places. So their relationship with a home shrine will be changeable and not so conscious. Since the objects are not usually regarded as sacred, the karmic repercussions of doing negative actions in their presence are diminished.</p>
<p>Even so, just having those reminders, those images of wisdom and compassion, can be of great benefit. Even if not much comes of it in one's life, there is an imprint left on the mind that may (some say <em>will</em>) bring the person back to the Dharma in future lives when the seed finds its appropriate ground.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In terms of placement, be aware that pointing your feet toward someone is considered disrespectful in East Asian cultures; and even in western culture there is a sense that the feet are 'below' the head. So we avoid stretching our legs and feet out toward a shrine (or toward a teacher or holy person), and for that reason we also avoid setting up a shrine at the foot of a bed. The entry of blessings and the ideal, most Dharmic, exit of the mind-stream upon death are both through the crown of the head; halos emanate from the head; and gestures of respect are often related to the crown. (For instance, in Tibet it's customary that if you drop a sacred text or object you immediately touch it to the crown of your head in respect.) So usually we try to keep sacred obects at or in the direction of the head, and higher than us rather than lower. In some cases this is not possible for practical reasons, and that's okay.</p>
