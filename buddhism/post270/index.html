  <h1>What does your sleep-wake regimen look like? Are most of you early risers?</h1>

<p>These days my wake cycle is erratic because of mundane responsibilities, so my routine is based more on 'when I happen to wake up' rather than a certain hour; but I've spent many years living in practice centers with more or less strict schedules, and have done many retreats at monasteries and centers in various traditions.</p>
<p>Most commonly, 5am is the morning practice time in North American centers I frequent, and in many European centers. Full-on mountain temples have 3am wake-up.</p>
<p>One of the personally most vibrant and delightful phases in my life — a time for which I have a very warm spot in my heart — was when I first started practicing Zen. Following the recommendation in one of the books I had read, I would jump up out of bed the moment I actually woke up, whatever time that happened to be. The first dawning of waking consciousness would usually happen before the first daylight on the horizon, between 4:30 and 5am. Sometimes earlier, sometimes later, though — I would let my bodymind have its own rhythm about it rather than follow an alarm clock.</p>
<p>Upon waking, and with an vibrant sense of eagerness, I'd hurry to the washroom and splash cold water on my face, quietly and quickly do necessary washroom things, and then immediately go to my sitting spot and begin practice. At that time I didn't yet have a dedicated mat or cushion. (One of the key benefits to this approach at wake-up is that if you move decisively without sort of hesitating or mulling it over, you immediately express your wisdom mind, and the entire beginning of the day can function from an altogether different place than mundane consciousness — you function from the before-thinking mind.) My sitting would proceed as the day rose, light and life, birdsong and human activity, and inner light all rising together. It was a very, very beautiful time, being alone with the world and experiencing its dawning as my own.</p>
<p>There is much benefit to this approach. It is supposed to be very healthy to rise before sunrise. Rising before dawn (i.e., the first light on the horizon) is not strictly necessary in this regard, but rising before the sun breaks the horizon is said to be best for the rhythms of the bodymind to find their balance and therefore their deep and appropriate function.</p>
<p>Besides this, early morning does have a special calm-but-bright quality to it that is supportive of meditative practice.</p>
<p>If energy cultivation is part of one's spiritual practice — and many traditional paths do include energy cultivation even if it's not spoken of overtly — then 3am and midnight are said to be especially effective times for this. I'm not sure about the reason for midnight practice; I just know that it is a popular and recommended special practice; deep layers of mind that connect on a universal level are said to be more accessible at this time of night. In times of crisis, or in order to develop practice at deeper levels of energy and consciousness (sub-consciousness, I suppose), or to train esoteric energies, or to overcome stubborn obstacles, midnight practice is recommended.</p>
<p>Midnight practice is practiced in various forms: In some temples, for example, chanting starts at 8 or 9pm and continues through the night, with practitioners variously seeing it through for a couple of hours, or to at least midnight, or all the way through to dawn. Some monks are known for never sleeping lying down; they may appear to nod off from time to time in the sitting posture, but their practice may (or may not) be happening in the background. In other styles, or as a special home practice, one would go to bed at the regular time but set an alarm clock for 12 midnight, at which time one would carry out a commitment or vow, doing a certain number of prostrations, mantra, or chanting before returning to sleep. Regular practice would continue in the morning.</p>
<p>As I said above, 3am practice is standard in some mountain temples. In addition, Kung Fu, Qigong, and other paths that aim at least in part at energy cultivation may do 3am practice. 1am to 3am is the phase of the daily energetic cycle governed by the Liver and the Wood element. It is a time when clear Yang energy may rise and thus be harnessed for energy cultivation or spiritual breakthrough. Many people will recognize it as the time of night when strong erections occur spontaneously as the Yang energy emerges; so instead of succumbing to dullness in sleep or, perhaps worse, debasing the energy with attached sexual thoughts, it is uplifted for the use of sublime and noble purposes.</p>
<p>Sex, the turning of the day, and the movement of subtle awareness in the body are all connected; and the ancient sages passed down some very detailed and scientific knowledge for harmonizing and harnessing these processes for the sake of spiritual attainment.</p>
<p>In practice centers where lay people with regular jobs and possibly families live, a more reasonable 5am or later wake-up time is often employed. Just as on the one hand there are a lot of benefits to following your bodymind's own rhythm, on the other hand there are a lot of benefits to submitting to one clear, simple, healthy schedule. For instance, you get to practice repeatedly giving up attachment to sleep, gradually getting more free of some very deep habits of dullness and indulgence. You also get to act together with others, encouraged and energized by the knowledge that everyone else is working on the same project of awakening and facing the same rigors of schedule; and furthermore your self-centered perspective and mountainous ego and attachments are gradually chipped away day by day.</p>
<p>If you only every get your own way… your own favorite… your own style, then transformation — moving into what you have <em>not</em> yet been — is impossible. So external practice structures and acting together with others help you to give up your weak, selfish clinging. Over time the wisdom of the structure itself and the appropriate relationship to each part of the day becomes internalized: you are no longer driven inevitably by your preference, but become free to choose harmonious and appropriate ways of relating regardless of your previous likes and dislikes. This is the emergence of great Compassion and Wisdom.</p>
<p>In terms of health, waking early is said to be very good. The Yellow Emperor's Classic On Medicine, an ancient Chinese text on the rhythms of life, says that while too little sleep can harm the body, too <em>much</em> sleep can harm the spirit, which is far worse. I think we can understand and relate to this: when you oversleep, and especially when you habitually oversleep, a certain dull indulgence can take over and you can become more concerned with getting what you want than with clear spiritual progress. The clarity of your presence can diminish.</p>
<p>But our lives are not the same as they were in ancient China. Relationships with place and people are more complex, responsibilities more numerous and less clear. So while we may have an ideal in mind, it has to harmonize with our reality. The question then is what supports your great direction toward awakening in life, regardless of whatever ideal situations may have been taught in the past or may have worked for other people in other circumstances. What works best for <em>you</em>? Sometimes you know this yourself; sometimes a clear teacher can see it better than you.</p>
