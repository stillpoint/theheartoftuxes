  <h1>Prayer beads and prostrations</h1>

<p>One of the functions of a <em>mala</em>/string of prayer beads is to count practices like mantras or prostrations. Yes, you can wear the beads as a simple reminder of your way of life, and to remind you to bring your mind back to open presence whenever you see or feel the mala.</p>
<p>Another way of using the mala is to move along it bead by bead, letting each new bead be a new moment of simple presence. It is a way to return to simple mind, just having a moment of presence with the sensation of the bead in your fingers. Nothing special.</p>
<p>Different sects and cultures have different customs regarding prostrations. In general, three bows to Buddha are expected when you arrive at a temple and when you leave. Also, if you are visiting a practice temple (as opposed to a cultural landmark), if the master is near you may do three bows to her/him.</p>
<p>You can bow to a statue, a painting, a photograph, or a sacred object. You can bow to your mala or to an empty space. But really, you are not bowing to these things; you are bowing to the <em>real</em> Buddha, the true, living, omnipresent reality of awakening. This is the same as the mind of all enlightened beings, and is the same as your own original mind. Any statue or other object is just a representation of that reality.</p>
<p>But with your sincerity, you allow that reality to unfold. If you think of objects just as empty objects, that is what they are. But if you recognize everything as having the nature of awakening, and if you offer yourself in humble reverence to that reality, then you actualize the representations of that awakening and make them real. So in many traditions, although it is understood that a statue is just a piece of wood or metal, it is also understood that the image of Buddha is the same as Buddha. This depends upon your own sincerity and openness: you make the world a Buddha-world. That is why many people bow with such reverence to statues and images.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also cultural superstitions in the mix. If you keep your own sincere mind, you can participate in local customs without necessarily buying into their superstitions. Just don't add or subtract anything. When bowing, just bow. No need to make a special idea.</p>
<p>In the Zen tradition, the meaning is that simple: you do what you're doing. There is no extra meaning added. So the purpose of bowing is just to bow.</p>
<p>In the Vajrayana tradition, there's a lot more going on: beyond the mere statue or altar in front of you, you visualize and make real the refuge tree, a setting in which all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and other enlightened and enlightening beings are gathered, and together with all beings you take refuge in them, with each prostration. Hand positions, visualized light-emitting jewels, and the creation of a whole rich Buddha-land are involved in the practice; and that is followed by dissolution, in which you and all beings dissolve in the light of the refuge tree, returning all to original emptiness.</p>
<p>In that original emptiness, things are just as they are. This is the same as Zen-style bowing.</p>
<p>So this is just one example of how different styles lead to the same result. Dharma is this moment, as-is. Various traditions and methods use various skillful means to get there.</p>
<p>Prostrations are not only a ritual of obeisance. They are used as a powerful body-mind practice. Many sincere practitioners do 108, or 500, or 1,000 bows every day as part of their practice. Prostrations quickly bring you down out of your spinning thinking head and into a firm groundedness in the body (in reality). Prostration practice is very healthy and centering on many levels. So you will see some people, either out of heartfelt devotion or for the sake of a vigorous personal practice, who will do many full prostrations while others do a few standing bows. (There are online resources teaching the physical and breathing patterns of prostration practice. I have recommended prostration practice many times, so you can also search my previous posts for further information.)</p>
<p>Many forms of practice are possible. The most important points are your direction (<em>why</em> you do the practice) and your moment-to-moment sincerity. Don't think that any practice or object has some special magical power over any other. The magic is the re-application of your sincerity. Unguarded, uncontrived, aware... free of holding, wanting, checking, and making: keep that neutral, Unknowing mind.</p>
<p>Across the various sects of Buddhism, standing bows, sitting bows, and full prostrations each have their place. Injury or other handicap is not the only distinction between forms. Sometimes the less formal half-bow (standing or sitting) is more appropriate than the full prostration. Instead of trying to know everything ahead of time, learn within each tradition. That means you have to be a beginner when you are a beginner. You shouldn't try to be an expert when you are a beginner.</p>
<p>Don't try to save yourself from mistakes and correction, and don't avoid new situations. Go strongly forward with sincerity. If you are sincere, everything will turn out well. You will make beginner mistakes, and you will be corrected; and that is how you will become an expert.</p>
<p>Therefore it is best not to try to arrange your own practice. The notion of gathering advice from various online sources or reading books and then inventing your own practice is a totally misguided (although very popular) approach. We start from a place of ignorance, with deep-set habits and blind spots. Those habits and blind spots condition anything we might invent on our own. But we have access to proven paths of training and to living Bodhisattvas who can guide us; so that is what we should seek and follow.</p>
<p>Thus, while you can use prayer beads on your own to great benefit, if you want to learn their deep meaning and integrate their use into your life you should study within a tradition and lineage.</p>
