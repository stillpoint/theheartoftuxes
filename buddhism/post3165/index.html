  <h1>No Compassion from Parents</h1>

<p>Great things are ahead for you. You don't know how, or when; and that's the way it goes.</p>
<p>Take care of what's facing you, and things will unfold well. Your future unfolds from your present. There is no other pathway than this. If you keep a correct relationship to what's facing you in the present moment, in good times and bad times, easy times and difficult times, favorite times and not-favorite times, then everything that follows will start to unfold clearly.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches that your situation comes from your past good and bad actions. The difficult, suffering parts of your life are the results of negative actions in the past, from this life and previous lives. But the fact that you have a human body, freedom from physical and mental debility, the capacity to communicate well, the intellect to understand well, the opportunity to meet good teachings (the Dharma), <em>the motivation to seek them out</em>, the willingness to receive them, and the ability to put them into practice — these are all extremely, extremely rare and precious factors, and they all result from many positive actions that you have performed in the past.</p>
<p>So how your life goes from here, based on this blend of results, depends on whether you now proceed negatively or positively. Thinking about your situation is sometimes necessary; but dwelling on it, brooding about it, continuing to generate thoughts of condemnation and frustration and shame, are not necessary and not beneficial. So you need to practice putting-down. When negativity arises, put it down like you put down a backpack after a long day, or like you put down a rock that you don't need to carry. This is a practice, a training. It is the generation of positive karma, to create positive results: the conditions leading to your liberation and enlightenment.</p>
<p>When doing a putting-down practice, if your mind is not already mature and stable it is very good to have a clear object to return to, a sort of touchstone or anchor that helps you let go of the grip of thought. Thought takes you away into an unreal world. The thought world <em>feels</em> real, and has real effects on your mood and perception, but it is made of illusory material, mind-material. When you have a clear object to return to, you can let go of the unreal world in which you suffer, and return to the real world where you can make a practical difference in your life. You return to the situation facing you, and establish your correct relationship with it.</p>
<p>When dinner faces you, you eat. When finished dinner faces you, you wash the dishes. When waking time faces you, you get up, splash water on your face, and remember your great purpose as a human being — to wake up. When a suffering being faces you, you ask "how can I help?" Each situation has its correct relationship. And when the situation is that you don't know what to do, then only don't-know; that is correct — don't-know, until things clear up. Meet each situation plainly, sincerely, and your future will unfold well.</p>
<p>There are many instructions available for mindfulness practice, and most of them offer some object of mindfulness for you to return to. You can choose your favorite. The main thing is to keep returning to presence. Gradually you will begin to identify how thinking takes you away and creates your illusory suffering world. And gradually you will get better at returning to the real world where you can take steps toward positivity. Eventually, you will remain in the real world, and thoughts will not have the power to take you away. Then you will have mastery over your life.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Mind is the forerunner of all actions.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>If one speaks or acts with a corrupt mind, suffering follows,</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>As the wheel follows the hoof of an ox pulling a cart.</em></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Mind is the forerunner of all actions.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>If one speaks or acts with a serene mind, happiness follows,</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>As surely as one's shadow.</em></p>
<p><em>- The Dhammapada, v.1</em></p>
<p>Along the way, you will seek out healing. Meditation and mindfulness have their correct functions, but they can't do everything. You will have to find helpers to guide you through healing of the wounds passed down through generations of your family. Therapist, counselor, life coach, crisis line worker — there are many experts in family dynamics who can help you come back to yourself and overcome frustrating patterns.</p>
<p>Love is simple, not fancy, not complex. You already understand it; you just have not received a lot of support for that understanding. But you have been fed and housed and tended to when sick. You have received love even if you didn't recognize it, and even if you needed more. Children <em>always</em> need more. But the world supports you every day. You have the light and warmth of the sun, the air to breathe, the space to move, the possibility to live. A tremendous amount of love comes to you moment by moment. But if your thinking takes you to its illusory world where everything is about <em>me, me, me</em> you don't have the eyes to perceive the love that comes your way.</p>
<p>Turn around <em>me, me, me</em> and offer something simple: a helping hand, a compliment, a smile, a gesture of warmth. Offer it just to offer, without any thought of recognition or reward. This will bring love into your life. You can never <em>get</em> love; you can only be it. Those who try to get it always suffer. (But I hope you get it anyway.)</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>If you want to try an object of mindfulness that will help you with putting-down practice, I recommend returning to awareness of your contact with the ground. When standing or walking, keep some background awareness of your feet on the floor or earth. When sitting, keep returning to awareness of your feet on the floor and your seat on the seat of the chair. When lying down, feel your contact with the bed or sofa or floor. Your physical foundation will help you find the place where you are... it will help you return to the real world, where you can make a difference in your life. Often, just being present is the greatest difference you can make. Sometimes, taking definite action is necessary.</p>
