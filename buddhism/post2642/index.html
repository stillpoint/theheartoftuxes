  <h1>Hello friends. I have been feeling a lot of regret lately about what I have done in my life and what I have failed to do. Fellow Buddhists, how do you deal with the feelings of regret?</h1>

<p>Regret is a very important and useful feeling (or more accurately, constellation of thoughts and emotions). The key is in channeling the energy of regret into determination and action.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First; <strong>look deeply</strong> into the past actions and the causes for regret, so that you can see clearly the cause-and-effect relationship. Investigating deeply leaves no room for doubt and subsequent backtracking ("well, maybe it wasn't so bad..." or "maybe it'll turn out better the next time I do the same thing").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, <strong><em>feel</em></strong> the regret and any other emotions that arise with it. Your will to stay present with the emotions is needed, since we habitually avoid things that don't feel good to us. But <em>seeing</em> deeply (as above) and <em>feeling</em> deeply will seat the lesson firmly in your consciousness, and make the energy of it available for you to use. If these steps are skipped over, the transformation is not as clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also <strong>embrace positive emotions</strong> that may arise. Compassion for yourself and, by extension, to others who may make similar mistakes may arise. Frustration or pent-up feelings may actually indicate your will to move — to change, to take action; and this can easily move into a determination that projects strongly into the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a strong decision</strong>, informed by what you have seen and felt, to refrain from bad action and to undertake good action. <em>Goals</em>, with very clear ends and time frames, can ground the transformation in concrete and achievable terms. <em>Vows</em> that express your unconditional mind, not depending on situations and results, can carry your determination well into the future, like shooting an arrow from a strongly drawn bow. A very strong vow, based on clear seeing and deep feeling, can project through many lifetimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to <strong>root the transformation in action</strong> as quickly and directly as possible. Get rid of the objects associated with the bad action; banish the toxic relationships or take immediate steps to heal them; set in motion your positive activity. If the issue is fear and procrastination, for example, then set the appointment, make the phone call, book the ticket, do the meditation practice, or perform whatever first step you can; and do it as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, rooting your vow with actual <strong>physical actions</strong> will make it stronger and more real. Lighting incense, holding hands in <em>gassho</em> or prayer posture (or even stronger, in 'diamond vow' posture by clasping hands together with interlaced fingers), making bows in front of an altar, and publicly announcing your vows and goals to friends (or, if anyone else was injured by your bad action, directly to them) — all of these help to strengthen the transformation. This is using mudra — embodiment of the quality you seek.</p>
<p>King Ashoka is a magnificent historical example of the power of seeing and feeling deeply. Employing the energy of sincere regret, he transformed his life from one of utter brutality to one of exceptional wisdom and kindness, the benefits of which we still experience to this day. In his day, he was known as "Cruel Ashoka" or "Compassionless Ashoka", and would regularly and violently crush enemies within and outside of his domain, employing his armies to subjugate the largest territory under one rule up to that time. When one opposing force managed to resist, he sent a massive army to decimate them. His wife, a Buddhist, could no longer bear his cruelty and left him, taking their children with her. At that time, Ashoka went to visit the site of his 'victory', and saw the incredible suffering he had caused. It is then that he voiced the famous phrase "What have I done?", no doubt linking his own personal loss and despondency to the desolation he saw around him.</p>
<p>Ashoka's willingness to see the effects of his actions on himself and others brought forth a deep regret. From then on, he established a rule of order, ethical conduct, peacefulness and generosity toward neighboring realms, religious tolerance, and social support within his own country. If I recall correctly, he set in motion the longest period of peace in any nation's history. He established schools (universities, really), hospitals, and veterinary centers. His establishment of vegetarianism is likely the direct cause for the existence of the practice in our modern-day world. All of this, because he was willing to see his actions and feel regret.</p>
