  <h1>Please help, I'm lost.</h1>

<p>Ongoing fear of addiction is another kind of addiction. We need to build the stability and faith that lets us go forward without fear, without reactivity. This faith resides when our understanding is no longer speculative but experiential: the path is no longer something we strongly believe is right, but rather something we know is right because we have seen it in our own experience.</p>
<p>So experiencing good teaching and consistent practice, and their effects on day-to-day life, is necessary. This experience doesn't depend on being in a particular situation, other than having access to good teaching and doing a regular practice.</p>
<p>You can become a monk, no problem. But the choice must come from a place of groundedness and stability, not reactivity. It must not be part of running away from certain challenging issues in your life, because a monk moves with freedom and detachment, unshaken by situations. You wouldn't want to escape habitual clinging to sex, only to fall into habitual avoidance of sex. Sex is empty; it is no monster. Like any temptation, it is not real. The thing to be uprooted is self-concern and misunderstanding of the essential nature of life.</p>
<p>Although you could become a monk, it is also not necessary to jump directly there. The most important thing for you now is to find a good teacher and digest a practice. Learn commitment to practice, go through the process of ups and downs, gains and losses, while deepening your relationship to practice. This is important. It's important to learn that there is no perfect situation, even monkhood. It's important to learn that avoidance is not the same thing as freedom.</p>
<p>But yes, it's also important to preserve the right conditions for your development and to protect your growing energy. Our society is unbalanced and out of control, so a certain detachment is healthy. (Hermetically sealed is not.) When your mind and emotions become more stable through relationship with a teacher and ongoing practice, then you can venture into all kinds of situations without losing your way.</p>
<p>The big illusion that many seekers fall into is seeking their own good situation. Their concern and effort becomes 'all about me'. A drama develops and concern builds: “How will I find <em>my</em> best way?" It insidiously becomes a pursuit of one's favorite situation and avoidance of what is not one's favorite, but it has the added charge of spirituality, the sense that it's urgent and all-important. But this pursuit is led by ego. You can check yourself: Does this anxiousness have grasping behind it? Is the desire to control your experience at work?</p>
<p>Behind all our fears is our discomfort with emptiness. We want things to be certain and graspable; it gives us (the self-clinging self) anxiety when things are up in the air, unsure. Our spiritual maturity is predicated on the ability to be okay with uncertainty, to be open-handed and non-reactive with emptiness. That is the basis of wisdom.</p>
<p>The thing to be uprooted is self-cherishing and misunderstanding about true nature. The spiritual aspirant's practice is to keep a balanced, ungrasping mind in all situations, not just his favorites. So challenge, difficulty, strangeness, and temptation are actually your Dharma friends, helping you develop a balanced, ungrasping mind.</p>
<p>If you are lost, it is because you are thinking. You have created an issue with your mind.</p>
<p>So if you are lost, you need to return to where you are, in reality. Where are your feet standing this moment? What is in front of your face this moment? Ask these questions of yourself, and suddenly you are not lost; you are here. It's just that the ego's agenda of having certainty is not being fulfilled. Never mind that.</p>
<p>Your true way unfolds by itself, through Unknowing. It is arrogance to think that it all depends on your one decision. Your way unfolds moment by moment as you stay in right relationship with reality. Don't think that <em>you</em> make it all happen. “Throw yourself into the abode of Buddha." Entrust your moments to the Buddha, and let the Buddha guide you. Through ungrasping and unknowing, your Buddha -- your innate wisdom -- will guide you.</p>
<p>Then brushing teeth time, just brush teeth. Something falls, pick it up. Someone stumbles, help them. Know where your feet are standing and respond to what's in front of your face. Surrender yourself to each situation like this. This is the Buddha Way unfolding; and this is monk-like activity. It's not about figuring out your own ideal situation and then trying to get it, but about offering yourself to real life, moment to moment.</p>
<p>I hope you soon find a good teacher, become stable in practice, keep returning to real life in the moment, and become a Buddha to save all beings from suffering.</p>
