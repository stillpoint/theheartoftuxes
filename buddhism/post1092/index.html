  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Be momentary.</p>
<p>Make that continuous.</p>
<p>I only learned how that was possible when I spent a lot of time in residential practice and got to witness very devoted, sincere practitioners going to work every day — as journalist, handyman, nurse, businessman, mother, student, artist, office worker, cashier, and monk.</p>
<p>Every day, the resident practitioners would disperse and attend to their work, and every day they would gather again for practice (we had morning bowing, chanting, and sitting; and evening chanting and sitting, and sometimes Dharma talk). So there's that level of 'returning to practice'. But I also got to witness the moment to moment care and clarity that people demonstrated. It didn't mean that things always went like a utopia; there was a fair share of aggravation and contention, but people always returned to practice and always tried to remember or take the hint to let go of opinion and focus on the important point.</p>
<p>There were some teachers and practitioners who were not only very busy in their day-jobs, but who had added responsibilities administrating and teaching in the community; and to see them being very kind to a newcomer, or taking the time to listen to concerns of residents, or just holding a bowl attentively — these examples showed me how intent is expressed.</p>
<p>You know how you come home after a big day and feel like just lazing on the sofa? Well, imagine someone whose work is quite a bit more demanding than yours coming home, and then doing some hours of work for the practice center, and then leading practice and teaching a class with meticulous clarity and kindness, <em>and then staying in the Dharma room after everyone has left, in order to do extra practice!</em> On the one hand, it is kind of mind-blowing how much energy and devotion can be expressed; but on the other hand, you get a very obvious lesson on where that energy comes from. They are able to do it because they keep their mind with Buddha from moment to moment. There is no struggle about where to go, no doubt about where life is aimed. One part of the mind doesn't fight another part. There is no aspect of their life where they 'nip out', trying to escape the clear intent. The clear intent is clear; it is certain and stable... and joyous.</p>
<p>Expressing clear intent is not something you 'figure out' and then have a pat answer for from that day forward. You don't 'have' it; you <em>do</em> it. It is your practice, your moment to moment to moment to moment application of releasing opinion and concept, and taking care of the current situation.</p>
<p>Success is no problem; do your very best, but do it for all beings. Don't just give it lip service. If you know that your mind is miserly, take on special practice of generosity. If you know that your mind is lazy, take on special practice of vigorous effort.</p>
<p>Doing residential practice is sometimes like a crucible or nuclear reactor: the practice place reaches a level of energy where people are inspiring each other and feeding off of each other's efforts, without anyone making a special show. Sometimes you see a fellow practitioner on an early winter morning, when you know they got home late the night before, and they have a spring in their step as they head to the Dharma room. That can be very inspiring, without even a glance being exchanged. But also you may see that person practically <em>dragging</em> their half-dead body to the mat; and that can be every bit as inspiring. We show up in a million ways; but we show up.</p>
<p>The way it's integrated is very simple. Especially in Zen, you only rely on one point. Go straight to openhandedness, to Unknowing. This is Dharmakaya. You rely on this one point for everything; you keep returning there.</p>
<p>This one point digests all the issues, problems, and doubts. It also digests all happy and edifying experiences, as well as all plain mundane experiences, and it makes them all into wisdom. It is like a universal enzyme, making everything into nourishment.</p>
<p>So you keep returning to this one point. If you do mantra practice, you keep returning to the mantra. If you do mindfulness of breath, you keep returning to breath. If you do formless Zen, you keep returning to Unknowing. Let the one point do the work.</p>
<p>Then, occasionally (but far less than many people expect) you may take some time to plan your day or plan your year or your 5-year plan. You do it when it's time to do it, and then you get back to clear practice.</p>
