  <h1>I've got some questions for class, would appreciate some help :)</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> When traveling to a distant shore, one uses a vehicle until the shore is within reach. Upon reaching the shore, the vehicle is unnecessary, and thus is abandoned.</p>
<p>Yes, one cannot reach Nirvana as long as one wants to. In fact, <em>one</em> can not reach Nirvana — if there is a "person", there can't be Nirvana; and if there is "reaching" there can't be Nirvana. So Nirvana is beyond words and ideas. Don't think that getting some words and ideas will mean you understand the crucial elements of Buddhadharma; that would be a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> There is no right and wrong, only cause and effect. Like teachings about aspiration and desire, or path and pathlessness, teachings about right and wrong are adventitious; they are useful for certain people in certain situations, but they don't reflect an ultimate truth.</p>
<p>The question here is what is the overriding aim (of life and death) — what is the purpose? This is something you have to clarify for yourself. <em>If</em> your perspective aligns with Buddha's teaching, you see that our usual life and death are bound up in cyclical suffering. The only release for you is awakening. And if you have true compassion for other beings you also see that helping <em>them</em> to be released also depends on your awakening.</p>
<p>So the question is how one's approach to dying and death contribute to awakening. Are the right causes gathered, or are they frittered away? The two main issues are <em>purification of karma</em>, and <em>clarity of mind at the time of death</em>.</p>
<p>Our great teachers point out that human life presents an extremely rare and precious opportunity to advance toward ultimate Buddhahood. In human life we find the ideal balance in between extremes of pleasant circumstances that would lead to utter complacency and painful circumstances that would completely occupy the mind. If one also has the intellectual capacity to understand the Dharma (the teachings), the compassionate capacity to offer oneself to the Path, and the capacity of wisdom to see and undertake the changes that need to be made, this is the particular configuration of conditions necessary to progress toward awakening; and these conditions are to be found in our human life. Furthermore, the leisure to investigate and practice is available is many of our lives. Some humans live hand to mouth and eke out an existence without the time or energy to consider spiritual advancement; animals and beings in hell realms are too dull or occupied with fear, anger, or intense pain to be able to progress; beings in very sublime states (think: the ultimate yoga spa lifestyle) lose awareness of the cyclical nature of suffering and don't understand that their good situation will end, so they indulge without thought of practice. So this chance — when we have all of these excellent faculties, access to good teachers and teachings, and the awareness of what has to be done — is very, very, very precious. Recognizing that, one would make use of every last moment. Even if it involves great pain and difficulty, one practices to and through the last moments of life.</p>
<p>The pain of aging, illness, and dying is our karmic burden; it comes from our own past causes; and it needs to be clarified in order for spiritual progress to occur. Otherwise, those past causes only bring us more suffering. If life is cut off short, the chance for karmic seeds to ripen in awareness may be lost. There is no guarantee that the next life will offer these opportunities, so the karmic seeds that are yet to ripen may take us far off the path. It may be many thousands or millions of lifetimes before we come around again to a situation where we can actually consciously take steps toward awakening. But in our present lifetime we can encounter the results of our past actions with awareness and equanimity, allowing our karmic burden to be lightened and cleaned, and clearing these obstacles to our development of insight and compassion.</p>
<p>Each moment of life is a rare and precious chance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if one does not have sufficient strength of aspiration and strength of meditation to handle extreme pain, the mind may turn fearful and confused. Since the transitions from one state to the next (for us, birth and death) are very significant opportunities for advancement toward awakening, clarity of mind is extremely important at the time of death. So depending on the situation, one may take measures to ensure as clear and peaceful a death as possible, so that one can move beyond rebirth; or, if rebirth can't be escaped, so that one can take an advantageous rebirth that will aid one along the Path.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> There are (at least) three major vehicles of Buddhist teaching and practice. In the vehicle of renunciation, relations and desires are indeed seen as distractions from the Path. In the vehicle of transformation, relations and desires are seen as the material that is transformed into awakening. In the vehicle of primordial reality, where everything is seen as awakened mind, from beginningless beginning, relations and desires are seen as awakened mind itself, with no distraction and no need to correct. In all of these, there is no difference between hetero and homo relationships in the bearing they have on awakening; how one uses one's mind moment to moment is the pivotal factor.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> I'm answering your question just now.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> When were you reborn from the person you were yesterday into the person you are right now?</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have infinite, boundless love. It is possible for us, and that is our intent and practice. There is nothing it doesn't include.</p>
<p>Mistakes appear when one thinks of a "me" <em>doing</em> the loving (or whatever boundless, enlightened activity is in question). That is an immature view, and as one learns and practices the view will change. There is no person, so no one does the loving. There is no space, and there are no separate beings, so there is nothing the love extends to. There is no time, so "expansion", "end", and "beginning" don't apply. We only use the words in a conventional manner; they don't have any reality of their own. Don't think that getting some words and ideas will mean you understand the crucial elements of Buddhadharma; that would be a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> To borrow a phrase from Christianity, render to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. That is to say; of course relative teachings must apply to each specific circumstance, and must be updated in many ways, not only in social and scientific terms. The updating must be instantaneous and constant, responsive to each new moment. This is beyond society, beyond science, and beyond human thinking; it comes from primordial wisdom.</p>
<p>But that which is absolute is always true, not depending on time or place, subject or object, life or death.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Who asks this question? From whence did this question appear?</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> You should be asking questions of yourself, not only gathering what amount to newspaper clippings from others. Dead words say "this" or "that". Live words have no intent behind them.</p>
<p>I hope you find your true life. Thank you for your time. :)</p>
