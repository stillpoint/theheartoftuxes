  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><strong>First</strong>: "real world"?</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>: When you return from vacation, is there not a let-down? In my experience it's quite common to experience let-down after all kinds of departures from usual patterns.</p>
<p>And the more full the experience, the greater its absence may be felt. Most 'peak' experiences are accompanied by low periods. Whether it's an ecstatic release through dancing, or a high-energy adventure with friends, or a falling-in-love experience, or an intense therapeutic workshop, or a lovely travel vacation, or a meditation retreat, these kinds of events usually come with a swing of the pendulum in the other direction. 'Up' comes with 'down'.</p>
<p>The best way is not to make a big story about it, not to judge it, but to <strong>let it do it's appropriate work on you, and just keep moving</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>: Before and after everything, there is emptiness. When you first receive this experience in a raw way after retreat -- exposed, sensitive, having cleared away much distraction -- it is a very vivid experience of emptiness. Ungraspability and boundlessness are felt down to the bones, and it is unnerving, and easy to think of the experience as 'bad' or wrong. But it is not wrong; it is reflective of the truth underlying manifestation: everything returns to emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>Emptiness is not wrong.</strong></p>
<p>But as one returns to the common, habitual, egocentric relationship with life, that truth of emptiness is perceived as jarring, if not overwhelming. <em>Being</em> emptiness (as can happen in retreat) is not a problem; it is wisdom. But re-becoming a 'someone' who <em>feels</em> empty... that prompts anxiety. After all, the Third Patriarch of Zen said that the shared human sickness is anxiety about emptiness. One feels lost and directionless, adrift in the ungraspable.</p>
<p>The ungraspability <em>is</em> the direction. That is your true practice. All methods just aim there. Let emptiness be. It is correct.</p>
<p>This feeling of drifting is exacerbated by the fact that one has now lost some of the structures that contributed to the sense of being 'found', of having a clear direction: the schedule, practice form, teacher, teaching, and practice companions have all dispersed -- the practice container has dissolved.</p>
<p>The dissolving and dispersing is just part of the cycle of life, but at the time it is experienced in a quite vulnerable way. All things come and go. Gain and loss is the nature of manifestation. The time after retreat is particularly evocative of loss. That is all; it is not wrong, it is just very poignant.</p>
<p>The more one fixates on the 'self' undergoing the sense of drifting and loss, the greater the suffering.</p>
<p>Some strategies can be useful after retreat; and it is unfortunate that more teaching is not offered about this phase of practice. Experienced practitioners tend to figure it out for themselves after a number of retreats.</p>
<p>There is a kind of culture clash between the clear direction and continuous sanity of retreat and the relatively senseless, trivial experience of modern society. It is an important part of training to practice moving between situations freely; but until one becomes very centered and adaptable, switching quickly can 'tear the soul' -- the sudden change disorients, harms one's integrity. Therefore it is useful to <strong>schedule a period of tapering-in</strong> after retreat, to facilitate communication and integration between the two quite different situations. For example, continuing quiet, meditative time in a spa where you can relax and do some body care can be very good after retreat. And some people do residential practice, so their regular practice schedule starts right up immediately following retreat.</p>
<p>You might <strong>schedule more alone time</strong>, you might limit hectic appointments or social interactions. You might plan on regular periods of <strong>self-care</strong>, whatever that means to you at the time.</p>
<p>There can also be a rebound effect where the practitioner becomes very conceptual or sinks into indulgent behavior. The aim is not to wield an iron-fisted control over behavior, but to <strong>be aware of the ways we attempt to fill in that raw experience of emptiness</strong>: through over-eating, consumption of entertainment, taking mood-altering substances, thinking too much, and other indulgent and distracting behaviors. Be aware of the tendency toward self-harm just in order to avoid feeling open, boundless, evanescent.</p>
<p>The tendency to immediately conceptualize experience can be a particularly thorny issue after retreats. "What does it all mean? What happened? What did I get? Was it worth it? What now?" As most people know, trying to figure out one's life through thinking is a special kind of suffering.</p>
<p>Supportive strategies in this regard may include <strong>maintaining silence, and avoiding printed and spoken words</strong> (or at least maintaining mindfulness of right speech by avoiding gossip, trivia, lying, self-aggrandizement, and self-distraction). </p>
<p>You might also make an effort to <strong>keep a very simple mind</strong>, engaged with simple, physical reality: just walking, just washing this dish, just going to the washroom, just sitting down, just breathing, just attending to what the hands are doing....</p>
<p>It may be helpful and important to <strong>avoid abandoning the practice</strong>. After retreat there can be a sense of relief from the effort: "Whew! Now <em>that's</em> over, and I can relax! It's not that you shouldn't relax, but that this kind of thinking can throw away the structure that has been embracing you, giving your life a good direction, keeping your mind from going to dark places, and so on. If you immediately drop it, what will fill the void, other than the old habits of mind and body? This is good to consider.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to <strong>maintain your connection with Sangha</strong>. If you know others who attended the retreat you might get together for practice. Different people digest experience in different ways; some do better with solitude, some do better with community; though of course it also changes for everyone.</p>
<p>Generating and dissolving is the way of the world. As practitioners part of our job is to make friends with that process. It is the same as bowing practice: we stand up into form, then we let go into dissolution. Again, again, again. Becoming expert at these two phases is a kind of mastery within manifestation. Much of Vajrayana practice trains this quite intentionally, as one creates very complex visualizations of Buddha realms, and then dissolves them into emptiness. The repetition of the generating and dissolving develops skill in relating to form: one can use it powerfully, like the dreamer creating a whole world; and then one can let it all go without disturbance, like the dreamer realizing the nature of the dream.</p>
<p>So this post-retreat emptiness is another important part of your training.</p>
<p>From the <em>Seven Points Of Mind Training</em>:</p>
<p>&gt; Post-meditation, be a child of illusion.</p>
<p>Play along with the whole charade of appearances. Enjoy them as they arise, enjoy their passing as they pass. Keep moving on to the next thing without getting trapped in any stance, for or against.</p>
