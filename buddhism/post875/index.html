  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Yes, there is good reason. Result follows cause.</p>
<p>To achieve the result of relative clarity, it is necessary to practice relative freedom from thought (which in turn has its own required causes and conditions).</p>
<p>To achieve the result of <em>ongoing</em> clarity, freedom from thought has to be practiced in a consistent and transformative way, enough to overcome much of the habitual dullness and distraction one has accumulated.</p>
<p>To achieve complete clarity, insight into reality, unconditional life, great wisdom, and great compassion, exceptional practice of freedom from thought has to be practiced, from moment to moment to moment.</p>
<p>We are so trapped and burdened by our own thinking that we don't even begin to realize the extent of it until we have progressed quite far along the path of practice. And even then.... Even then, it is often the case that a practitioner will <em>think</em> of themselves as far along the path, only to be cut down by their own pride or blindness. Commonly, it is the very advanced practitioners who practice most consistently and with the most energy — because they are beginning to realize more deeply how dire the situation is, how deep their attaching mind-habit goes and what kind of effort is required to overthrow it.</p>
<p>Conversely, the more trapped you are in your world of thought, the less you realize it.</p>
<p>Since we are all trapped by our own thought, mere accumulation of thought is no cure; and it is almost a maxim of practice that "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing". The propensity to conceptualize almost every experience easily poisons one's mind, heart, and relationships.</p>
<p>So the basic issue to be attended — the big mess in the middle of the floor, the big elephant in the room — is <em>how can we bring our life's center out of the head where it is caught up in delusion, and down into the body and into clear action and into the real world?</em></p>
<p><strong>"One moment of seeing is better than ten thousand times hearing."</strong></p>
<p>This teaching is not about the senses of seeing and hearing, but about the primacy of direct insight, which only unfolds through practice, not by gathering concepts.</p>
<p>Although some basic knowledge is required to know <em>how</em> to practice, and as one progresses and begins to enter new territory and gain new capacity also new knowledge is required, the required proportion of thinking-style knowledge to practice is utterly the opposite of what most people imagine.</p>
<p>For example, the Sixth Patriarch of Zen was not very well read (some sources say illiterate); and yet he attained supreme enlightenment even beyond that of many of his contemporaries. There are many similar examples. This shows that sincere practice — returning to the primary point of clarity — is most significant, not mere knowledge.</p>
<p>Why do people mistake the amount of thinking and reading required? Because of Spiritual Materialism: the same grasping, attaching, egocentric habit that rules their lives also invades and co-opts their 'spiritual' practice. Although the teaching says otherwise, their own habit and fear says that <em>more</em> is always necessary. More getting, more thinking, more doing, more becoming. And the prospect of actually facing and residing in open presence — that boundlessness, that selflessness, that emptiness — is extremely agitating, if not horrifying.</p>
<p>As the character Richard Brown says in the film <em>The Hours</em>, we're "always giving parties to cover the silence". We're always seeking something to fill the space.</p>
<p>For a clear, sincere person, maybe one phrase from a teacher is all it takes to transform a life. In the old days, that's how it worked for some. Someone, acutely aware of suffering and impermanence, would walk for three weeks and climb a mountain to meet a teacher they only heard about by word of mouth; and in a single meeting, the teacher would hit their mind. Then the person would return to their life, and try to penetrate the meaning of that mind-hit, perhaps for years or decades. Very simple mind; very sincere. Who can do that these days?</p>
<p>These days, we actually need both more teaching and less thinking. We are under much thicker layers of complexity, from the years and years of trivial and ridiculous images and stories and activities we engage in, to the disconnecting effect of virtual reality, to sedentary life that divorces us from our bodies, to far more complex economic interdependence, to all kinds of physical and mental pollution.... Many layers contributing to our disconnection and dullness. We are very stuck up in our heads — some may think irretrievably: our world seems hell-bent for ruin.</p>
<p>So the value and necessity of <em>returning to the root</em> — getting out of the head and into the body, and settling back into that pure presence at the root of mind — can't be overstated. The more we attach to words, the more we need to practice returning to the root. And the more our world goes mad, the more we need to hold the root for it, a tribe of root-holders doing what needs to be done for the sake of all beings.</p>
<p>When we're honest about it, after the first couple of books we already know what has to be done. The ego would just prefer to <em>seem</em> like it's involved without actually surrendering its regime; so instead of going to the pure well of clear water, we pick up another book, get into another line of speculation, and hook up with others who will tacitly agree that it can all be figured out through chatter, and who will encourage each other to <em>talk</em> rather than <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>The kind of teaching we need tends to be more along the line of turning us back to our practice, back to our own minds, time and again. Ten thousand times. Ten million times. More. "Put it all down, and return to the root." "Get out of the head, get clear." Again. Return. Again. Return.</p>
<p>If a person doesn't know <em>how</em> to put it all down, get out of the head, return to the root, get clear (which are all the same thing), then they need (1) proper teaching and (2) to do it. Reading and thinking and reading and thinking become avoidance, wasting this precious life opportunity.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>This all hinges on either doing the practice that leads to liberation, or avoiding the practice that leads to liberation. Avoiding practice in Buddhism is called <strong><em>kausidya</em></strong>: <strong>laziness</strong>. There are three categories of laziness identified.</p>
<p>The first category or type of laziness is <strong>sloth</strong> or procrastination: leaving practice to a later time, never generating the will or energy to return to practice <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>The second category is <strong>self-doubt</strong> and discouragement: thinking of oneself as unworthy or incapable, thinking of the task as unachievable, or doubting the practice itself. Often we think we are somehow noble to belittle ourselves, but actually some pride is required and is very practical. We need to get back to the job of waking up!</p>
<p>The third category or type of laziness is what we're talking about here: <strong>busy mind</strong>, sometimes called 'negative activity': occupying ourselves with things that don't matter, things that don't carry us along the path of Dharma. We'll make up big dramas about mundane issues, imagining that we can somehow 'solve' life and come out on top. And we'll even turn spiritual teaching into poison by using it to avoid actually <em>acting</em> on that which is being taught.</p>
<p>So for someone with very busy mind, or someone very attached to thought, as a great many of us are in this day and age, a ratio of 100 parts practice to 1 part reading is a very reasonable and necessary cure.</p>
