  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's called <em>Upaya</em>: skillful means in matching level of teaching to level of understanding.</p>
<p>Here's a small selection of scholars and masters who disagree with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>This distinction between levels of understanding, between levels of wisdom, is fully acknowledged in the Buddhist tradition, and is worked out as a graded ascent through three distinct levels of wisdom, or <em>prajna</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A Concise History of Buddhism</em>, by Andrew Skilton</p>
<ul>
<li>[In Buddhism]…beings at different levels of understanding and attainment are taught in ways and at levels appropriate to their understanding and attainment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy</em>, edited by Dr Brian Carr, Indira Mahalingam</p>
<ul>
<li>It also incorporates the notion of skillful means (<em>upaya</em>) as part of the style of the teaching, which pays attention to the different levels of understanding and spiritual achievement of different audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy</em>, by Oliver Leaman</p>
<ul>
<li>It is through skillful means (<em>upaya</em>) that the Buddha tactfully adjusts his manifold provisional teachings to the different capacities and levels of understanding of his followers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Upaya Process, the Lotus Sutra, and Soka Practitioners: Manifesting Potential Enlightenment Here And Now</em>, by Susan Goodson Fatherree</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, different beings with different dispositions and predilections can receive compassion no matter what, depending on their levels of understanding and evolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/buddhism/cul/cul02.php</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that Buddhism traditionally operates with hierarchical and developmental notions of spiritual understanding and moral attainment, it follows that beings at different levels of understanding will be given teachings and methods which are appropriate to their level of understanding. This means that general statements about the nature of Buddhist teachings must be treated with caution, as the level of teaching and the kind of group or individual to which it is directed needs to be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Buddhism</em>, edited by Peter Harvey</p>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha presented three levels of teachings, which are called the Three Vehicles or the Three Yanas. The appropriate level for each individual depends upon one’s understanding. These three main approaches have different goals and ways of presenting reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://shamarpa.org/the-three-main-approaches-in-buddhism-an-introduction/</p>
<ul>
<li>One needs to recognize which aspect of Lord Buddha’s teachings are being presented. The instructions on the Four Noble Truths deal with relative reality, those on emptiness address ultimate reality. The final instructions that Lord Buddha imparted speak of the Buddha nature and are extraordinary. If you do not understand the level of teachings that are being presented, you may think that the teachings are contradictory, which is not the case. For example, sometimes it is taught that there is samsara and nirvana. At other times it is said that samsara and nirvana are indivisible. You need to understand why the different levels of teachings are available and presented to students.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.dharmadownload.net/pages/english/Natsok/0010_Teaching_English/Teaching_English_0031.htm </p>
<ul>
<li>…the concept of <em>upaya</em>, or “skill-in-means,” according to which all Buddhist theories and practices are pedagogical tools or expedient devices that must be adjusted to the level of the people’s receptivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Buddhist Faith and Sudden Enlightenment</em>, by Sung-bae Park</p>
<ul>
<li>The Two Levels of Understanding:
 I will review my talk on the two levels of understanding so that you can remember it. The first level is understanding the specific characteristics of mental and physical phenomena. The second is understanding the general or common characteristics of mental and physical phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.buddhanet.net/vmed_8.htm </p>
<ul>
<li>The compassionate lord Buddha Shakyamuni has revealed us many different levels of teachings. Among all the teachings that he has given, if you know how to take the essence of his teachings in terms of instructions and implement these, this would be the best.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.sangye.org/english/four_arguments_2.htm</p>
<ul>
<li>By his compassion and skillful means, Buddha has taught different levels of teachings to meet the needs and understanding of various sentient beings.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://cybershedra.namdrolingmt.net/ </p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhist texts, as a rule, make a distinction between the “assumed” meaning and the “real” meaning of the teachings, a distinction which roughly corresponds to the various degrees of the student’s intellectual acumen. …it is evident from the general trend of Buddhism that the “real” meaning can be understood only when the student’s intuition has been developed to a certain extent and depth.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Levels of Understanding in Buddhism</em>, by Herbert V. Guenther</p>
<ul>
<li>The three levels of teachings given by Buddha Shakyamuni to all his various types of students 2500 years ago which answered all their various needs are still the authentic source of all Buddhist schools today.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.buddyzm.pl/en/meditations-and-teachings/81-buddha-s-teachings</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha set forth many different levels of teachings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Becoming Buddha: Wisdom Culture for a Meaningful Life</em>, by Renuka Singh</p>
<ul>
<li>Since people have different capacities, there are three or nine different levels of teachings, generally known as the nine vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Repeating the Words of the Buddha</em>, by Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Erik Pema Kunsang</p>
<ul>
<li>Of these five levels of teachings, Pure Land teachings are mainly classified as immediate-realization teachings. …In addition, in veiled or explicit statements, Pure Land teachings can also be found in the first three levels of teachings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thinking of Amitābha Buddha</em>, by Rulu</p>
<ul>
<li>The teaching of expedient means (<em>upaya</em>), taught in the <em>Lotus</em> and other Mahayana scriptures, offered a convenient way of dealing with this problem, by which the proliferation of teachings could be explained as the result of the different levels of understanding and spiritual readiness of the audiences to which they were addressed. Different teachings were suited to the needs of different beings. The teachings could then be arranged in a hierarchical order, beginning with the most elementary and advancing to the most profound. The progression of the teachings was often pictured as following the course of the Buddha’s teaching career, with their order outlining a curriculum of spiritual development.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sudden and Gradual: Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought</em>, by Peter N. Gregory</p>
<ul>
<li>After the Buddha reached enlightenment in Bodhgaya, he taught many levels of teachings on how to overcome suffering. From several of these teachings arose the four Buddhist Tenets (codes and those who follow them), which are: Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Madhyamika, and Cittamatra. From the teaching of the Four Noble Truths in Deer Park in Varanasi, India, two tenets arose: Vaibhasika and Sautrantika. From the teaching on Sunyata (emptiness) at Vulture’s Peak (Girdhakuta), arose Madhyamika. From the teaching at Vesali, where he taught the Mind Only School, arose Cittamatra.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.losangsamten.com/files/02_intro_buddhist_path_4_tenets.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li>We could discuss many different levels of teachings and teachers eventually, if we have time and interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A-TibetanBuddhism/Authors/LamaSuryaDas/TheTeacherbyLamaSuryaDas/LamaSuryaDas-TheTeacherLearningfromBoththeFoolish.htm</p>
<ul>
<li>During his teaching career, Khenpo Rinpoche was renowned for his highly original, profound, and engaging presentation of the wisdom teachings. He was particularly revered for his teachings on the “view” of the true nature of reality. Khenpo Rinpoche presented this view in a series of progressive stages, providing a sound foundation for our understanding and meditative experience to gradually develop and mature.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stages begin with the question “Who am I, really?” and an exploration of the true nature of the individual. They move on to examine the nature of the phenomenal world in which the individual lives, as described in the different levels of teachings on emptiness and prajna-paramita (transcendent wisdom).</p>
<p>http://www.wisdomsun.org/index.php/about-wisdom-sun</p>
<ul>
<li>The omniscient Buddha discerned that sentient beings have varying capabilities of attaining enlightenment, he therefore provided different levels of teachings and methods that are appropriate to each level.</li>
</ul>
<p>http://welcomingbuddhist.org/about-3</p>
<ul>
<li>So different levels of teachings are given. Sometimes these teachings may seem to contradict one another and even counter each other’s propositions. However, it is said that the teachings are presented that way in order to reach the widest audience. People require teachings appropriate to their different levels of understanding, aptitudes, and dispositions. Buddha gave teachings in such a way that the meaning could be understood on many different levels.</li>
</ul>
