  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p>&gt; Hinayana Buddhism correct teaching. Mahayana Buddhism is correct teaching. Also Zen Buddhism is correct teaching. The most important point is how you use their teaching to attain your own mind.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There is a very good story that illustrates this. A long time ago in Korea, there was a famous Zen master named Hak Un. He lived alone on a high, craggy mountain. In the valley below his hermitage were two nuns’ temples. One day, there was disagreement between the nuns of the Eastern temple and the nuns of the Western temple. The Eastern temple nun said, “When you chant to Kwan Seum Bosal, you must pronounce it ‘Kwan-Se-um Bosal.’ But the Western temple nuns countered, “No, that’s not correct. It’s ‘Kwan Se-oom Bosal!’” So this sound is a little different for each temple. One group of nuns said, ”kwan Se-um Bosal” is correct, the other claimed, ”Kwan Se-omm Bosal” is correct. In each temple, there were more than two hundred and fifty nuns. So they were always fighting, fighting, fighting. “Ours is correct!” “You’re no good! Oom is correct!” Ha ha ha ha! {Laughter from the audience] So they could not decide which one was correct.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One morning the head nun for the Eastern temple stood in front of her dharma sisters. “We cannot decide anything. So maybe we should ask the great Zen master up the mountain.” All the nuns thought this was a good idea. “So tomorrow night at nine o’clock we’ll talk to the Zen master and get his opinion on the matter.” Ha ha ha ha!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But the abbot had been a nun for more than thirty years. This problem really worried her a lot. “we say ‘um,’ they say ‘oom.’ Maybe ‘oom’ is really correct after all? If we are wrong, we will lose face. How can we be sure we are right?” Then she spoke with some other nuns. They talked back and forth all night. “Maybe we should speak with the Zen master before our meeting. Only how can we ask him the right way? This is very important matter!”
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Suddenly one young nun said, “Last year I was Zen Master Hak Un’s attendant. I know he really like rice cakes. You make some special rice cakes, give them to him, and then ask him. If we do this, maybe a good answer will appear!”
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Then all the nuns said, “Waah, that’s a good idea! You are wonderful!” Now, making rice cake is very easy. You take the rice dough, and roll it around, and slice off rice cakes with a sharp knife. So the nuns quickly prepared a wonderful plate of rice cakes. And they didn’t want the Western temple nuns to see them. In Korean temples, a bell is rung at nine o’clock, and all the light got out and the nuns must go to sleep. So they rung the bell as usual, and worked on the rice cakes in very dim candlelight. After finishing the rice cakes, two of the most senior nuns were selected to make the trip up the mountain to see the Zen master, carrying the helping plate of rice cakes.
&gt; 
&gt; After lots of climbing, the nuns finally reached his tiny hermitage. This old Zen master doesn’t sleep so much, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK. From the other side of the door, the Zen master’s voice could be heard. “Who’s there?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, sir, we are from the Eastern nuns’ temple.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s already past nine o’clock. What’s wrong?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, we have some --- well, um, there was a big birthday party for one of the older nuns. So we make these rice cakes. And now we think about you, alone on this mountain with nothing to eat! You like rice cake?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh! Rice cakes! Wonderful!” He was very happy, you know? So he let them in. the monk was laughing happily as they entered. Mountain monks don’t have so many cookies, not so much of anything, so rice cakes are a very wonderful treat. Monks love rice cakes! Ha ha ha ha! ”Oh, I like rice cakes!” Then the nuns gave him all the special cakes. “Very good! Very good taste! Wonderful! Delicious!”
&gt; 
&gt; The nuns were also very happy. “Oh, sir, do you like them?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, yes! Wonderful! Wonderful! Delicious! Thank you! Thank you!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Zen master, we have to ask you about something…”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh, any kind of question is no problem!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Our question is…” And they proceeded to tell him of the day’s events.
&gt; 
&gt; They told him about the argument with the nuns of the Western temple.
&gt; 
&gt; “They say ‘Kwan Se-oom Bosal. We are Eastern temple nuns. We say ‘Kwan Se-um Bosal.’ Are we right? Is Kwan Se-um Bosal correct?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course! You are correct! Kwan Se-um Bosal is the correct way.”
&gt; 
&gt; The nuns were very, very happy. “Oh, sir, tomorrow we will have to decide together with them. We want you to come and decide. So you will say Kwan Se-um Bosal is correct, right?”
&gt; 
&gt; “No problem!” [Laughter from the audience] Then the nuns hurried back down the mountain, and went to sleep. Their plan worked, so they were very happy! Now they wouldn’t lose face in front of the nuns of the Western temple.</p>
