  <h1>Masturbation and buddhism</h1>

<p>The aim is to move beyond the grip of desire, <em>in an effective way</em>. Until the final stages of Bodhisattvahood the desire is not extinguished, but rather one develops freedom from it -- desire comes and goes, but it doesn't have to be the last word; one don't have to be controlled by it.</p>
<p>One has to have wisdom about the approach. The aim is to move beyond, but realize that it will not happen in one fell swoop; the impulse is deep, so the time frame is quite long, and demands a matching aspiration and a consistently balanced approach.</p>
<p>Suppression will not do. Forcing the issue by applying pressures from the outside will only increase the pressure on the inside. If you define a single act as a failure, you will start to think of yourself as a failure, and that will take you farther from the Path. So wisdom and self-compassion have to balance the intent to do better.</p>
<p>Going beyond desire is not the only issue. Sexual energy is the “basis of bliss", the power of unification. It is like condensed presence; the more consistently present you are, the more this substance is nourished and purified. But this is also the substance that is <em>drawn upon</em> for presence -- for concentration and unification. It is either released in a single brief sexual experience or it is recirculated to feed numerous or continuous spiritual experience.</p>
<p>As one progresses on the path, preserving and purifying the sexual essence becomes more critical, and that is one reason why the vows and commitments may become more strict as one progresses. The requirement is higher, but also one's ability to regulate one's mind and energy is more sophisticated. So these things need to develop step by step, in proper balance with one's actual situation and ability.</p>
<p>So if we accept that letting go of desire and conserving sexual essence are important, and if we accept that suppression is not a helpful strategy, where does that leave us?</p>
<p>First, keep a natural and easy attitude while studying the Way. Don't go too far in either limiting yourself or indulging. <strong>Keep your eye on the prize.</strong> Let the focus be on Dharma rather than getting mired in the details of life. That is to say, at the beginning stages it will be far, far more significant to learn the Dharma, attain the correct view, and stay consistently engaged with spiritual life than it will be to try eradicating desire or fussing about this or that action. Just don't hurt anyone with your action, and you'll be well ahead of the game. That's already positive karma!</p>
<p>Stay mindful of the Dharma, and develop your aspiration to attain the Dharma completely. That karma is inconceivably more significant than this or that negative action in regular daily life. Keeping your eye on the prize will keep you in contact with good influences, and you will keep returning to the path that can liberate you. Gradual spiritual progress will take care of all life issues. On the other hand, if you get caught up in trying to control specific actions you may lose sight of the real goal, and the whole pursuit can become ego-driven.</p>
<p>That is the first and most important point. Keep your eye on the prize. Next, you can use your environment, associations, and activities to help balance and calm your desires.</p>
<p>If you just try to use will power, that's a very difficult way; almost no-one can do it that way. Usually the pent-up energy only gets diverted to another area, so the energy takes hold from the unconscious realm where it becomes much more difficult to purify. Neurosis and perversion develop.</p>
<p>Instead, regulate your energy by regulating your life. The emphasis is on cooling the mind and heart, making your body and your life structure stable containers for energy. Make your environment clean, orderly, and beautiful to calm and inspire the mind. Remove or regulate over-stimulating influences (in this case, pornography, computer access, lowbrow images and influences, excessive electronics and other hot, buzzing, distracting influences). Allow spaciousness, cleanliness, contact with natural elements (earth, water, air, natural fire, flowers, sky, sunlight, etc.). Arrange your living and working space so that you can be reminded of spaciousness, peace, and Dharma. Wherever your eyes land most often, and wherever the focal point of the room lies, let that hold an image of peace and inspiration rather than confusion, triviality, or attachment.</p>
<p>Your acquaintances can be similarly regulated. You don't have to write people off, but consider how you are affected by the people you spend time with. Is it uplifting your life or is it killing time? Or worse, is it keeping you engaged in negative patterns of thinking and acting? As you associate more with people who are self-possessed and of noble intent, your own energy will settle down and come under control.</p>
<p>Hot, stimulated energy is very difficult to control. Just being in a busy city can soon make you too agitated to deal. The electronic-age habits and social media relationships similarly stir up the energy. This has to be balanced; this has to be intentionally countered not only with occasional meditation, but with an overall cool and settling influence in environment and activity. <em>Sila</em>, one of the three divisions of the Path (the others being Samadhi and Prajna), is usually translated as discipline or ethical behavior, but it means literally “coolness". Cool down the influences that make your mind and energy flare up out of control.</p>
<p>Activity, of course, is also to be regulated. In particular, it is very helpful to be “in the body", doing lots of simple physical activity rather than being “up in the head" talking, viewing images, making ideas, etc. Physical exercise or physical work has a simplifying, grounding effect on the mind and energy. It helps you be in the real present moment, and build a vessel that can deal with big energy -- a good Dharma vessel. In general, be aware of how your activity contributes to peace or agitation.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the very best things you can do to regulate your energy is to spend a lot of time with an awakened being, a teacher. Not only will their clear, grounded energy go into you and help you, you will also benefit tremendously by learning the Dharma and seeing first-hand how it is <em>lived</em> moment to moment.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
