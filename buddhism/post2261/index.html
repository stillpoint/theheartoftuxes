  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Yes, it's a very important point: wisdom doesn't come from the teacher. The teacher doesn't make you enlightened. You are originally so. But that doesn't mean the teacher and teaching aren't necessary. It's just that your completion doesn't come from them.</p>
<p>Egotism masquerades as independent thought. Again, there are many who avoid all kinds of teaching situations — not because the teachers or teachings 'aren't absolutely necessary', but because they <em>fear</em> the possibility that they will have to give up their opinions, preferences, and habits. They fear the light shining on them, revealing their shortcomings and errors. It is the self-clinging that is intimidated by anything that could disrupt it. These people champion philosophies of independence and skepticism, but they are actually driven by visceral, emotional avoidance.</p>
<p>Do you want to say that some hypothetical person may not need a teacher, or do you want to hold out hope that <em>you</em> don't need a teacher? This is where ego slips in and takes control.</p>
<p>Reality is always there, always bright and clear. It doesn't vary. There are not degrees of brightness of this 'moon'. What varies is people's ability to perceive it. Therefore the pivotal point is how that ability matures. Because if you're a being, already you have ignorance.</p>
<p>So if we get down to brass tacks, the point is are <em>you</em> awakened? If not, advocating a notion of self-certification — that at some point you will just declare yourself 'finished' — isn't helping you; it has no application to your actual situation other than as wishful thinking or delusional bravado.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The 'self-declared' master Isshi initially studied with the famous master Takuan and did hard residential training at Daitokuji Monastery. He was further confirmed by an enlightened master, and yet further he continued to both practice and teach within his original lineage. When you talk about independent attainment, this is the kind of example to be taken into account: someone with exceptional capacity and exceptional motivation, who studied with an exceptional master within an exceptional training environment, and <strong><em>then</em></strong> for a time went off on his own to unfold his practice... and <strong><em>then</em></strong> returned to confirm his attainment.</p>
<p>The 'self-declared' master Jinul (Chinul) took monk's vows and underwent monastic training <em>from the age of 15</em> (some sources say from the age of 8), and had completed studies so well that he passed the national monastic exams (for advanced positions such as abbot or administrator-monk) at age 25. He took precepts with and studied with Zen Master Jonghwi (Chonghwi). So he was doing daily residential practice under a master for at least 10 years, including whatever monthly and seasonal guided intensives were part of the teaching schedule. He also did a great deal of scriptural study. Disappointed with what he saw as inferior motivation of many monks, <strong><em>after</em></strong> his monastic training he left <strong><em>with other experienced monks</em></strong> to start a training society based on their higher standards. So even in his supposed isolation, he was not only receiving teachings of masters though scripture, but entered a contract of mutual accountability with his companion monks. Together they immediately set to building <em>another</em> training place/monastery, where Chinul practiced. So again, one has to refrain from fantasizing about 'awakening in isolation', and realize that these masters did indeed recognize the necessity of receiving teaching and practicing with others; and only after they had internalized the essential teachings (how to carry <em>prajna</em> from moment to moment in all situations) did they make their own way.</p>
<p>...and even at that, these were very extraordinary beings, with tremendous dedication and capacity. I mean, if you're saying that you are just as extraordinary, and that you have done a decade or so of hard, continuous, all-day practice with an enlightened master... then yes, we can make a case for going off and letting your practice mature 'in isolation'.</p>
