  <h1>Post stream entry question</h1>

<p>I'm not saying you haven't attained stream entry or something significant. But there is a self-involved, and now reactive, quality to your writing that perhaps you don't notice or take ownership of.</p>
<p>My aim is not to put you down or belittle your experience, but to help you find a clear path.</p>
<p>We all have some kind of wounding, difficulty, blind spot, and other conditioning. Peace absolutely is possible even from within the many different formations of suffering mind. But the way things unfold is still almost inevitably shaped by our conditioning. The peace can be very real, and yet ensconced within or alongside neurotic or narrow-minded formations. This is one of the many situations in which a teacher can be so valuable: she or he can shine a light that helps you distinguish between what is essential and what is to be let go of.</p>
<p>You may have very good reason to mistrust institutions or authoritative figures. Even if that were not the case, the unfolding of your path may not be so tied to formal teaching situations; but it could still be of tremendous value to you, and even critical, to receive guidance and other support from someone who has walked the path before you. Not all teachers are attached to tradition; and ones with a high degree of attainment are especially able to speak to what students may think of as their own unique situations.</p>
<p>There is no need to be something in particular. You don't have to be around people. You don't have to relate in old ways. You have always been free to choose or just to move, but now perhaps that freedom is coming into focus.</p>
<p>There may be a period of digestion, during which you assimilate your experience. You shouldn't expect to immediately be clear on its ramifications. But how you digest your experience will depend on the way you keep your moment to moment mind -- not only regarding the experience, but regarding your new perspective. Can you remain unattached? Can you put it down completely and let things unfold without your interference?</p>
<p>Here is yet another case where an external structure can guide you when you yourself don't always see the way, and where a living teacher can help you keep the thread rather than squander it. The fact that you have not yet overcome your difficulty with teaching situations may now become an obstacle to complete unfolding. At some point, whatever style of engagement happens, you will hopefully let go of the need to grasp that control. Perhaps when you feel safe enough.</p>
<p>As Zen Master Dogen said, deep practice feels like something is being forced upon you. This is the impact of training upon the clinging, dependent mind (what is popularly called 'ego' -- one's idea of oneself). Practicing alone, one almost invariably follows one's own preference, which is conditioned by those past traumas; it becomes practically impossible to go beyond one's patterns with one's patterned mind.</p>
<p>There is more than one way. You don't necessarily need to submit to traditional training within a group in order to receive guidance (though that may very well be the best thing for you). But it is the tradition of sincere practitioners to have no obstacle. For example, most of the high-level practitioners I know welcome the opportunity to practice outside their own tradition and method, outside of their comfort zone. It is seen as an expression of their absolute groundedness that they can go to any situation, to any teacher, and harmonize with the way things are done there.</p>
<p>Someone with authentic attainment doesn't need to cling to his own 'way'. Therefore there need not be any fear or doubt about having your experience checked by a teacher (or by several teachers) and taking on structured training.</p>
<p>I do relate to your situation. As your vision changes you are likely to be in more and more rarefied company, as fewer people can relate to you. But real maturity in practice comes when you can hold that pure and broad view, but still relate perfectly with anyone at any level and in any walk of life. So your own (<em>our</em> own) clinging patterns need to be further brought to awareness and purified, especially after gaining special realizations. Yet another reason why an external structure of training and practice with a teacher and group are so important: it's not just about getting attainment, but about relating to many different people and many different situations with effortless ease.</p>
<p>You may naturally need a sort of tapering-in period, like when deep sea divers return to the surface. A quiet time after retreat is often healthy. But soon you should take steps so as not to get trapped in your own mindset, not to think too highly of your attainments, but to allow the light of teaching to expose all the hidden attachments.</p>
