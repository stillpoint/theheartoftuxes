  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>That's why marriage is such a rich practice situation. Your relationship is always teaching you about your attachments; and there's not much opportunity to hide. If you keep your motivation to practice Dharma, this is a precious opportunity!</p>
<p>Do you have a teacher and daily practice?</p>
<p>Does your husband practice? Does he respect you and your practice?</p>
<p>Resentment is not helpful or healthy; but <em>admitting and communicating</em> resentment may be. The emotions all have some truth to them, some good reason why they arose, though not always why they are held.</p>
<p>The main thing is to be clear on the main thing. What are you on about in your life? What is your purpose; what is the bottom line? Awakening and compassion ought to be honored every day, not abandoned even when (or <em>especially</em> when) things get rough. So it's good to keep touching base with these values. It's good to have reminders of them built into your schedule, built into your family routines, built into your physical living space (by way of clean and calm surroundings, Dharmic images, altar, etc.).</p>
<p>Unless we are at the level of a great master, we are all moved by our close relationships. The issue is how fast can you reset? How quickly can you put it all down and return to the open, unmade, central point?</p>
<p>Having an ongoing practice helps. I suggested feet-on-the-ground practice to another Buddhitor recently. Others like mindfulness of breath. Mantra tends to be easy to practice throughout daily activities and is even possible to maintain in the background during charged conversations. Keeping a practice moment to moment through the day is not only possible, it's the aim.</p>
<p>And also, having a time 'to yourself' when you are completely devoted to resetting, to washing it all away and renewing yourself and your connection with Dharma, is very helpful and important. Even a few minutes every day is extremely, extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>After all, if you don't reset, you will be holding this stuff until it discharges on its own through unconscious behavior or illness or calamity. You could be holding it for hours, days, years. But if you at least have <em>some</em> time every day to consciously let go and let be, that is of tremendous benefit.</p>
<p>Don't blame your reactivity. But catch it as soon as possible. That's like saying "don't cry over spilt milk". The more you blame yourself (or others), the more tension will build. But when you catch yourself reacting, return to your practice and reset.</p>
<p>If you have to create certain conditions, like leaving the room for a moment, do that. Refuse to trade awakening and compassion for anything.</p>
<p>In the heat of the moment, find ways to reduce the pressure and relieve the polarization. Rather than 'me against you', look for ways to make it about 'us'. How do you move toward a win-win resolution, even temporarily? Can a different phrasing, or a kind gesture or word, or an invitation or request bring things to a less diametrically opposed shape?</p>
<p>Non-Violent Communication can be a helpful structure, since most family issues come down to communication.</p>
<p>I also recommend Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings on relationship and family.</p>
<p>I also feel I want to remember together that resetting doesn't mean being a doormat. It means you return to a neutral place, a mindset of equanimity and disengagement. For a moment, you 'have no dog in the fight'. What <em>comes</em> of that could have a wide range of possibilities. Sometimes setting a boundary is necessary — with a request ("I need..., would you be willing to...?") or a stronger communication ("You may not agree with me, but I expect to be treated with respect; and this is how I need you to demonstrate that....")</p>
<p>The anger has a reason for being there, to wake you up or to wake up the other party. Work on skilfully translating anger into <em>clarity</em>. Use the energy of anger to become very clear in defining your needs, expectations, and also your commitments and apologies and acts of reparation.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/33alym/how_do_i_let_go_of_anger_towards_somebody/cqjez3e">previous response</a> of mine to the question of "how to let go of anger."</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2cotl2/any_suggestions_for_dealing_with_a/cjhrult">my post</a> on dealing with a passive-aggressive spouse.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/44cys1/what_is_the_proper_attitude_and_response_to_my/czpcpd9">my post</a> on dealing with the harm that <em>you</em> make, including links on Shadow Work (which has to do with extreme or intractable reactivity).</p>
<p>Here are Thich Nhat Hanh's <em>Five Powerful Mantras Of Love</em>:</p>
<p>&gt; * First Mantra, <strong>I’m here for you.</strong> This is for generating your concentrated presence. It should be a statement of fact. Using awareness of breathing we know we are truly present.</p>
<p>&gt; * The Second Mantra, <strong>My dear, I know you are there and I’m so happy.</strong> To recognize the presence of your loved one. Your loved one may be a partner, child, friend, flower, anything.</p>
<p>&gt; * The Third Mantra, <strong>My dear, I know you suffer and I am here for you.</strong> Used when you notice something is not right, not well.</p>
<p>&gt; * The Fourth Mantra, <strong>My dear, I am suffering and I want you to know. I’m doing my best. Please help me.</strong> This can be difficult because it’s when you are suffering and you think your loved one is the cause. We want to punish. After you have tried to cool the flames, maybe 24-hours, then you can practice this mantra. Tell him in a calm voice. If you are not able, then write it down.</p>
<p>&gt; * The Fifth Mantra. <strong>This is a happy moment.</strong> Mindfulness is a source of happiness. This moment is worth living.</p>
