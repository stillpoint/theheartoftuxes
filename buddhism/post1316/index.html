  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Alcohol itself is not good or bad. In some high-level schools they'll drink a bit of alcohol to demonstrate non-attachment to rules. But the other side is that their conduct and compassionate action is otherwise at least as impeccable as other schools, if not more so.</p>
<p>Also, some teachers lead students who are very intrepid, ready to break down ego structures and preconceptions in order to awaken quickly. In these cases as well, alcohol is neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>But there should be integrity to the teacher and teaching. The actions should match the speech. It's sometimes not clear whether this is the case until you try the practice for a while.</p>
<p>Is your feeling intuition, or is it repulsion and judgment based on your conditioning? Do you know the difference between a good teacher and a bad one? Often in practice we run away from the situations that will shine a light on <em>our</em> attachments.</p>
<p>The most important thing you can do to find a good teacher is to become clear about your own life direction. When your direction is clear, then you can know what to accept and what to reject, and why.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>From a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/565ffo/does_meditation_need_to_be_still/d8gstey/">previous post:</a></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>what makes a certain type of studied meditation right?</strong></p>
<p>&gt;There are many good methods, and a few bad ones. If you connect with a traditional path that has a lineage, where teachers are approved and checked by <em>their</em> teachers, you will likely find a good practice. You are still responsible for yourself, though; so your involvement should match your understanding.</p>
<p>&gt;That is to say, go and check out some places and practices that interest you. You're not getting married to them; you're not becoming a monk; you're just trying them out. As you learn something about the practice, and as you see how the teachers and senior students interact with others you will have some more information to go on. Are they clear? Are they compassionate? Is there potential for happiness? Do they let you make up your own mind about things? These are good indicators. When you have more information and understanding, you can take more steps, make more commitments.</p>
<p>&gt;It's when people fantasize about practice and idolize (or demonize) teachers that they go wrong. If you give up your self-responsibility, then you can be manipulated. But for the most part, teachers are there for you, not for themselves.</p>
<p>&gt;You can also ask others who seem to be level-headed who their teachers are and where they practice.</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Where would you say would be a good place to start?</strong></p>
<p>&gt;A good place to start, and a good place to return to repeatedly, is the question "What is my life for?" This question provides your direction and helps you organize any information and experience you will gain along the way. If it doesn't align with your true life purpose (not just your wanting habit-mind), then you might ask yourself if it's worth your precious, limited time and effort.</p>
<p>&gt;Next, try something. Just try. Call, Google, visit, ask, join, email.... There are yoga studios, Buddhist centers, Taoist practice places, retreat centers, directories, classified ads in alternative or spiritual magazines, bulletin board postings at community centers and YMCAs, phone book entries, and of course search engines and Reddit forums.</p>
<p>~
From some of my other previous posts on the topic of finding a teacher:</p>
<p>&gt;I think, as many people as there are in the world, there are that many ways of finding a teacher. Each person will have their own path. But the basic point is to try. Try!</p>
<p>&gt; As you begin to try, your mind already opens to your as-yet unknown teacher, and the path to them also opens.
&gt; 
&gt; * You can ask someone who already has a teacher, someone you respect, about the possibility of meeting and studying with their teacher.
&gt; 
&gt; * You can check out common hubs like the classified ads of magazines like <em>Tricycle</em>, <em>Lion's Roar</em>, <em>Yoga Journal</em>, and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; * You can do an online search. Google 'meditation' and the place where you live, or use your own search terms.
&gt; 
&gt; * You can ask for recommendations in an online forum. Just be aware that advice on a forum tends to be 'shotgun style' — a smattering of various opinions and levels of understanding.
&gt; 
&gt; * You can visit hubs like yoga studios, temples, YMCA and so on. Sometimes even a local library may have community resources like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Just be aware that there are many people who <em>teach</em>, who aren't necessarily <em>teachers</em> in the sense of having the capacity to guide your whole spiritual process. They may have some experience in a particular practice and be able to convey the basics, but even if they speak with confidence there may be much that they don't yet grasp. You can learn from these people but you shouldn't place yourself in their hands.
&gt; 
&gt; A true teacher has attained the full fruit of their practice, and has gone beyond ego or at least has the capacity to go beyond ego with complete consistency — to provide you with the pure view despite whatever crap they themselves may be going through. But a master is completely there for you and infallably reflects the pure view.
&gt; 
&gt; Be even more wary of people who teach <em>without</em> experience, just because it happens to be the way they like to view themselves. "I don't know it, so I will teach it" is all too common.
&gt; 
&gt; Try, try, try to find your teacher. I searched for over a decade before finding my precious root master. I met many good teachers, some masters that I didn't completely connect with, and surprisingly few shady characters; but once I met my true teacher I understood that even a thousand years of searching would have been worth it. Initially the whole process started when, in high school, I looked up 'Zen' in the phonebook.</p>
<p>~
&gt; 
&gt; <strong>The teacher and institution's responsibility:</strong>
&gt; 
&gt; * to proceed with care for all aspects of a student's being, and to consider deeply the ramifications of any advice given
&gt; 
&gt; * to teach only what they know
&gt; 
&gt; * to teach only what they themselves practice
&gt; 
&gt; * to teach according to a student's level and capacity
&gt; 
&gt; * to admit what they don't know or can't skilfully address
&gt; 
&gt; * to distinguish between true teaching and opinion
&gt; 
&gt; <strong>The student's responsibility:</strong>
&gt; 
&gt; * to research the practice setting to determine as well as possible if it is safe
&gt; 
&gt; * to use wisdom in receiving the teachings
&gt; 
&gt; * to distinguish between spiritual matters that can be guided by a spiritual teacher and physical, emotional, and relational matters that are beyond the teacher's jurisdiction
&gt; 
&gt; * to maintain authority over her/his own body, mind, and well-being</p>
