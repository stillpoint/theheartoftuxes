  <h1>Is there a place for confession in buddhism?</h1>

<p>Buddhism is very practical, so rituals like these are not dogmatic or moralistic in nature, but rather ways to return to the path; and that means ways to return to your own original clear mind.</p>
<p>Confession is not as strong a theme as repentance. You always have access to the Enlightened Ones (no priest needed, though living manifestations of enlightenment can also be accessed), and you always have the opportunity to return to neutral in your own attitude. This is true repentance, when your mind lets go of all grasping and making.</p>
<p>For instance, when you are thirsty and you have a drink of cold water, you may have moments of no self-consciousness whatsoever — only drinking cold water. That is true repentance.</p>
<p>Or you may think of yourself as beset, depressed, ashamed, or whatever, but then in a moment something strikes you as funny and you just laugh, without a trace of "I, my, me". That is repentance, the return to original, uncontrived mind.</p>
<p>There are specific repentance rituals in Buddhism, but most practices already have repentance and giving-over as an essential element. I read from your comment lower in the thread that you are starting out in Vajrayana. Whatever practice you have been assigned by your teacher, be it Vajrasattva practice, going for refuge, or something else, likely is already practicing repentance.</p>
<p>In terms of specific confession/repentance rituals, others here have given very good suggestions. You can choose any. The main thing is sincerity; sincerity can make any form into the appropriate ritual. Shantideva's <em>Bodhisattvacaryavatara</em> verses are wonderful; other practices are wonderful.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Altar practice is a simple way to give over guilt, shame, and other negative emotions. You bring yourself to the altar, embodying your approach of sincere mind and awakening. The steps taken toward the altar and the respectful approach already evoke the noble mind, and begin to slough off small-minded negativity.</p>
<p>Changing water, you offer your purity to the enlightened ones. If you can't think of offering purity, just offer clear water. Offering a simple gift is already offering purity, and you receive the blessing of purity from it.</p>
<p>Lighting candles, you recall your own light, and offer it. If you can't recall your own light, just offer a lit candle. It is already lighting your mind and blessing you.</p>
<p>Lighting incense, you connect with <em>samaya</em>, your life's original vows and your compassionate practice that spreads to all beings. If you can't imagine holding vows or offering compassion, just offer incense, and that already is your sincere practice.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Prostrations are very overtly a repentance ritual. Mentally, emotionally, and physically, you repeatedly give yourself over and then stand up under your own power. As your body sinks with gravity, you surrender yourself to the Enlightened Ones, to the Path, and to your own Big Mind. As you stand, you express the mind that rises out of delusion and suffering. So within the space of one breath and one prostration, you embody an entire repentance ritual. This is possible in all schools of Buddhism, any time bowing is performed.</p>
<p>Prostrations are usually carried out over a certain number of repetitions or a certain duration. Some people make vows to complete thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of prostrations; and they are often part of preliminary practices required before initiation into higher practice. The repetitive and effortful aspects of prostrations are very purifying. In fact, the 108 prostrations performed each morning in many Zen and Mahayana temples are seen as a personal purification: one prostration for each of the 108 kinds of delusion. This gives you an even balance sheet for the day, so to speak; and if you want to transform <em>previous</em> karma, prostrations are like a fast-track practice for it.</p>
<p>In Zen, you just do the prostrations wholeheartedly. In Vajrayana, many visualizations are performed: seeing the whole refuge tree, offering and receiving light, shutting the gates of hell with the four limbs, and so on. You can choose which path works well for you.</p>
<p>If you're doing them as your own repentance practice, or if there is an issue weighing on your mind and heart, you can pour out what you are holding as you sink and touch your head to the floor or mat. Imagine yourself an emptying vessel. All negative thoughts, feelings, and patterns, you give over. All positive qualities, you offer up. You give everything over to that which can receive it and transform it into awakening — Buddha, or your own Big Mind. And you can collect yourself and return to clean, fresh, integrity as you rise and stand; a true human, with the same mind of enlightenment as all masters and Buddhas.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Don't write off therapeutic help. <em>You</em> are the one making the idea that it's all babble. That's not the case; at least not always the case. Just as there are good and bad teachers, and good teachers who don't suit your situation, there are right and wrong therapists for your configuration of qualities and needs. The important point is that therapy may have good ways to help you return to balance, understand your patterns, and overcome the obstacles in the way of your giving-over. It is interesting that the topic of your post is about being a lost case and the need for giving over, but you write off a particular kind of help (that may show you're <em>not</em> a lost case) and refuse to give over to it.</p>
<p>Seeing yourself as a lost case is a breach of faith. It is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kausidya">Three Kinds of Laziness</a> spoken of as obstacles to the path: one thinks of oneself as incapable or unworthy, and so doesn't even try the things that can help. (See the Five Obstacles/Faults and Eight Antidotes.) You're not alone; many seekers and practitioners over the ages have had this same kind of laziness. Your "I'm not worthy" is sometimes called <a href="http://www.diydharma.org/four-antidotes-laziness"><em>craving the negative</em></a>.</p>
<p>This very often appears as a strategy of avoidance. It's not that you necessarily think it's true at a deep level, but that it's a useful belief for avoiding self-responsibility. You may not want to make effort, face difficulty, realize that your problems are self-caused, or otherwise own your own power. It may be, as Nelson Mandela says, that your greatest fear is that you are powerful. But this doesn't have to be another burdensome thought. A good facilitator can help you find the motivation that you already have, and help you express your innate power.</p>
