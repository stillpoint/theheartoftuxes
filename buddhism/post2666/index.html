  <h1>I can't detect the sensation of breath going through my nostrils</h1>

<p>Great questions!</p>
<p>&gt;<em>What does it mean to meditate unattached?</em></p>
<p>Here's a formula for you:</p>
<pre><code>Enlightenment = Subject + Object
</code></pre>
<p>Meditation means merging yourself with reality, being at one with things as they are. But to say "merging" or "being at one" is already bad speech, because we are never separate from reality. <em>But we don't know that.</em> We consider ourselves separate entities, and do almost anything we can to preserve our separate existence. Our suffering comes from this delusion and separation. Meditation is our way back, letting go of the notion of separateness and becoming more intimate with reality.</p>
<p>This is done meticulously, often by coming closer and closer with the attention to a single object like either breath, counting, physical sensation, a colored disk, a candle flame, sound, or some other object. One devotes oneself to apprehending the object directly, as it is, without interpretation or discursive thinking. One lets go of any filters, preconceptions, or distractions that may arise — and they <em>will</em> arise; but the wonderful part is in returning instantly and without drama, returning to the object as-it-is.</p>
<p>There are many methods of meditation, and many of these are better named <em>concentration</em> or <em>contemplation</em>. Concentration is as described above: you repeatedly let go of distraction and repeatedly return to the object you're working with, and gradually the mind becomes less apt to follow the distraction. Focus develops, and stillness settles in. When the mind is still like a mirror-calm lake, then reality is reflected in it clearly.</p>
<p>Contemplation usually refers to analytical or devotional practices: in the former, coming closer to reality by really understanding where your thinking goes wrong; and in the latter, coming closer to reality by opening the heart to it.</p>
<p>Self-inquiry, visualization, physical methods like active labor, bowing, or dance, and many other methods exist. Their aim is (or should be) always to bring you closer to reality and merge with it. So in the final analysis, true meditation is the activity of reality itself, without any intermediary. True meditation means that when you sit you are not sitting as someone trying to do meditation, but rather you sit as the universe expressing itself.</p>
<p>The associated attitude may be something like 'letting go of the wheel' or 'taking the Nestea plunge' (remember the TV commercials where people would fall backwards into a pool?) — but in a simple, quiet, noble way. It's a radical openhandedness, without tension in the mind, because you are embodying trust. Through your practice, you express and actualize trust that you and your life are already complete and pure, without needing anything from the outside or needing to achieve anything else in the future. <strong>As such, you don't chase after anything and you don't avoid anything. You don't add anything to the situation, and you don't subtract your presence. Very neutral, very plain, very open-handed.</strong></p>
<p>Perfecting this plain, open-handed practice is what has produced all of the famous stories of masters being calm and responsive in the face of death. Anything comes: "Okay." Anything goes away: "Okay." Anything stays and stays: "Okay." So in meditation, don't try to get concentration or any particular mind state or feeling. Only follow the method. If you need further teaching on this, seek guidance from Nature; any rock or tree or cloud or river will give you perfect teaching on non-attached meditation.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>How should I focus on form so that I can avoid attachment?</em></p>
<p>Your original mind, the foundation of everything you experience in life, is already perfectly awake and perfectly functioning. So one side of practice is trusting that.</p>
<p>But you also, like all of us, have misunderstanding about who or what you really are, and you have many layers of mind-habits built up — patterns of thinking, reactive emotions, patterns of speech and behaviour.... So the other side of practice is uprooting these obstacles and deepening insight.</p>
<p>One side: always already okay. The other side: you have to try, try, try. So correct focus on form balances or embraces these two sides. You try never to abandon the form, but you also always proceed with the faith that you are already perfectly awake, already yourself Buddha.</p>
<p>During meditation, your patterns will continue to unfold. The habits of mind will show up; the habits of speech and behavior will show up. Sometimes these will show up as trains of thought or images, sometimes they will show up as feelings, and sometimes they will manifest as issues in the body like tension or pain. Never mind the things that arise, only do the practice. Maybe understanding that these are the outgrowths of your past activity will help you quickly disengage when they arise; or maybe you will be taken away for minutes, hours, or years. That's all okay; it's all the natural process of your karma. Just, at the moment you realize that you've gone on an excursion, <em>return</em>. Returning instantly and effortlessly is the main 'knack' of meditation. Don't cry over spilt milk, only take care of it and move on.</p>
<p>So when any kind of thinking arises, once you notice it, just return to counting or to following the breath or whatever your chosen method.</p>
<p>Over time, or maybe very quickly, you will see a pattern to the things that take you away from even-minded meditation. That means you will start to see your own mind, your own karma. Hunger or sexual thoughts or physical tension may drag you away, or it may be aspirations and blissful feelings or shining images that distract you. This is all just your karma unfolding. Don't mess with it and create more karma, but rather let it go and let it burn out over time. Then you will become more and more clear.</p>
<p>If you don't have a clear form of practice, it can be more difficult to see your mind. You will confuse diversions for the fruits of practice. Many, many, many 'meditators' confuse sleepy, dreamy states for actual attainment; or without being aware of it they wander after pleasure and avoid displeasure; and so they sabotage the whole aim of merging with reality <em>as it is</em>. Little concessions, little adjustments become more frequent or more drastic until the whole process is under the leadership of the ego, just trying to get what it wants.</p>
<p>But when you have a very clear form — count each breath until you reach "ten" and then start again; if the mind wanders or you lose count, return to "one"; and don't change your posture — then that makes it very easy to identify when you've wandered off. It will not be so easy to make deals with yourself to avoid the current situation, and you will be better able to see how your mind habits try to insinuate themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, take care of yourself. Don't injure yourself or develop too much tension by forcing yourself into a form before you're ready. But then gradually become stronger by taking on more and more discipline, making more and more effort. The Buddha taught the middle way between laxity and rigidity.</p>
<p>Good? Good luck!</p>
