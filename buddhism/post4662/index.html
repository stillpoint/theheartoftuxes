  <h1>Seeking feedback from experienced meditators</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>a consistent format allows us to see our changing thoughts</em></p>
<p>Yes, that's right. But not only that. You'll experience it yourself in practice, and then you'll know first-hand what I'm talking about. When the boundary is set — when, say, your set method is to count breaths to ten and then return to one, and you do that every time, it becomes very clear when the mind is wandering and when it is not. You may not notice your wandering at times, but you know the difference between being <em>in</em> the method and <em>out</em> of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you go back and forth between two or three different methods or 'give yourself a break' on following a method so strictly, it's not as clear when you're <em>in</em> and when you're <em>out</em>. Not only may you not notice when you've wandered off, but once you do notice your what your mind is doing you may not realize that it is functioning outside of the method, outside of clarity. It's like fudging on a diet. "How did I get so fat? I'm on a diet!" So you miss the opportunity to return to clarity, and you miss the opportunity to see <em>why</em> you wandered. That means you fail to see your own karma, so your karma keeps controlling you from beyond your awareness.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>How does one know what works and what is just a struggle worth sitting through?</em></p>
<p>This is a good question. One answer is that you don't necessarily know — you don't necessarily have the perspective and wisdom about practice yet. So a guide who can reliably hold the view beyond the wants and aversions of ego is necessary and very helpful. A good teacher can guide you better, having gone through all that territory him/herself, having led others through that territory, and having taken in your character and situation from an objective viewpoint.</p>
<p>Finding a good fit is important, eventually. But in the early years of a meditation career other factors are much more influential on your progress. While it's common for people to obsess about finding the perfect practice situation and the practice that's 'right for them', such a perfect thing may not even exist outside of the imagination. Much more important is for <em>you</em> to cultivate good practice habits, good attitude, good relationship with a teacher, consistent effort, ethical activity, and other factors of an overall spiritual life. Your consistent and sincere effort makes the style the right one for you, to an extent. Or to say it another way, no style can be right for you if you don't make a sacrifice to it.</p>
<p>There are guidelines for selecting a good teacher. These are passed down in traditional teachings. There are also guidelines for being a good student. You can listen to your own wisdom about situations that are physically or emotionally harmful, or in cases of fraud or other deception. But that just means that you need to take appropriate time and care to investigate. You are not expected to dive in without reasonably vetting a teacher and tradition. There will be a period in which you investigate each other, feel each other out. But when you have good evidence that a teacher's ethical conduct and wisdom are sufficient (if not perfect), at that time, you need to give yourself over more; you need to give it a sincere try, without holding back.</p>
<p>Along the way, if there are specific concerns you can consult your teacher, or another experienced student, or even consult with other Sangha members online. Who you consult depends on the nature of the issue, but in general you should cultivate closeness and trust between yourself and your teacher.</p>
<p>As your experience deepens in synergy with good teaching you will gain wisdom about what to face and what to sidestep. Physical pain, for instance, is a whole issue for practitioners everywhere. I think that there is both more attachment to the body in our modern western culture, <em>and</em> less care; and that's a combination that often creates injury, as people get dogmatic about pain rather than listening to what it's saying.</p>
<p>'What is worth sitting through' also changes according to your own growing ability and your progress along the path. When you are stronger you should face more than when your practice is still like a tender sprout. You may reach a point in your aspiration when you decide on your own that you will face <em>anything</em> that arises; or you may equally cultivate a warm compassion toward yourself and others that avoids unnecessary pain. These things get worked out over time, and each time you progress there will also be new unknown territory. If you keep moving, you will always be a beginner in that you will always be moving into the unknown.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask about particular issues. If your question is a mere concern about the future, let it go, and cross that bridge when you come to it (if ever).</p>
