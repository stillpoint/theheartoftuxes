  <h1>Anger</h1>

<p>Buddhadharma has a very skillful teaching known as the 'near enemies'. Good qualities are easy to understand, and their opposites (their 'far enemies') are likewise pretty easy to understand and identify. Like, the far enemy of love is hate. The <em>near enemies</em> are the tricky areas, the qualities that we can mistake for positive ones, but which are actually negative.</p>
<p>Righteous anger, the mounting sense of injustice accompanied by the mounting resentment or even rage against the world, is very common among spiritual seekers. This is simply because the spiritual seeker is more willing to look at things. Issues that previously didn't even appear on the radar are now taken to heart. Not only seeing but <em>feeling</em> injustice everywhere can quickly become overwhelming. So an anger that either seethes or lashes out in reactivity can appear. Since it is in response to injustice or tragedy, one sees this anger as righteous. This is a near enemy of true compassion. It is not righteous; it is not justified. It may be <em>common</em> and we may understand how it reasonably arises, but it is nevertheless self-serving anger.</p>
<p>And this is what distinguishes near enemies from actual positive qualities: the near enemy has "I"; it has a self-centered component.</p>
<p>So-called 'righteous' anger usually appears to compensate for a sense of helplessness or fear. Seeing all the trouble around you, or being the victim of abuse, you naturally experience moments of helplessness. It is a deeply vulnerable, perhaps even groundless state. There seems to be nothing you can do, nothing to hold onto. The empty, weak, and fearful feelings can be overwhelming. So quite automatically one rouses a feeling of strength, to avoid feeling the vulnerability. And what emotion provides immediate feelings of personal power? Anger. Anger rushes to fill in the perceived weakness of fear and helplessness.</p>
<p>But there are several problems with this dynamic, not the least of which is that the last thing the world needs for its healing is more reactive anger. Anger shuts off other feelings and other possibilities, as you yourself experience (you wouldn't be reaching out here if you didn't realize it was limiting you); it blocks pathways of resolution and prevents you from making wise and compassionate choices that can start to transform the situation that concerns you.</p>
<p>Reactive anger also covers up that initial fear or vulnerability, which is so important. That information is vital! It informs your heart, connecting you to the vulnerability of all life. It humbles you, allowing you to take action from a place of open responsiveness rather than trying to manipulate the situation and impose your opinions upon it. It brings you into acute awareness of reality — of impermanence, of where you stand, of what stands to be gained or lost. Without that initial deeply-felt vulnerability, compassion becomes dogmatic, empty of life.</p>
<p>So the first thing is to understand this dynamic and to see how the near enemy arises.</p>
<p>Next, before you do anything, before any response or plan is initiated, <em>put it all down</em>. You <em>must</em> start from openhandedness. Reset, return to neutral. Physically, let the jaw and hands relax, let the shoulders sink, drop the body weight, release the tension of defensiveness or aggression, release the tension of grasping or avoidance, and return to neutral. Mentally and emotionally, let go of any holding, avoiding, or making. Let it be. That is the rule: start by letting it be.</p>
<p>Only then — when you have felt the pain of others, when you have felt your own vulnerability, and when you have opened your hands to it all — only then are you ready to take action. And when you do take action, offer your heart to the activity rather than asking the activity to give you something for your heart. If you are treated with unkindness, offer your kindness. If you see wounding, offer healing. If you see inequality, offer equanimity. If you see aggression, offer calmness.</p>
<p>The world haunts you because you hold on to 'you'. You have your idea, your opinion, your favorite way, your best plan, and because you hold tightly to those the world becomes a problem. So this is the self-centered component of the near enemy. It is not just that there is injustice; it is that there is injustice <em>and it's a problem for you</em>.</p>
<p>The original cause of the injustice and the cause of your anger are the same: self-cherishing. This is the ignorance, the delusion that drives all of these plagues: holding on to "I, my, me". If you want to uproot the injustices and tragedies, there is really only one true enemy, and that is your own self-cherishing. When you uproot that, you can help your world.</p>
<p>So this is what meditation is for. It is a repeated returning to openhandedness, beyond self-centered agenda, beyond the petty-mindedness of "I, my, me". You offer yourself openly to the moment, whatever feeling or situation appears. Thus you become a force of equanimity, a force of peace in the world.</p>
