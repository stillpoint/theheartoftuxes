  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'll give you two different types of reply (in two separate posts).</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Please understand that my response to you is to help you wake up, not to get you to adopt this opinion or that one. So the emphasis is on <em>actually seeing what is the case</em>, not on dueling philosophies. So please take the time to look into things. Don't just react instantly, rejecting what doesn't fit with your way of seeing things or your sense of how things ought to unfold. Neither should you accept something merely because it sounds amiable. Don't jump so fast to the next point on your agenda.</p>
<p>From your questions and responses, I can see that you haven't taken in my first reply, not deeply. There is a continued insistence that the teaching should come to you on your terms -- in the way you want, at the time you want it, and in the language you expect.</p>
<p>Like many people (and especially modern westerners), you may understand theoretically that you need to experience things directly, through a process over time, supported by your own consistent effort; but in your wanting and your approach you still expect it to all be handed to you on a platter. "No, <em>you</em> make <em>me</em> understand, before I have to take a step." The great obstacle of ego -- it's fear and need for ultimate control -- prevents wisdom from entering you. You are the one who closes the door on Dharma. If you ever study with a teacher you will, hopefully, eventually come to realize this point and avoid wasting life with an attitude of entitlement in the future.</p>
<p>Even if the teaching <em>were</em> to come to you this way, this seemingly perfect way, it would then have no transformative effect. It would only be what you already want and expect; it would not move into <em>the new</em>, which is your concern -- moving into new territory, becoming something different and unique, being reshaped.</p>
<p>Although we may talk boldly about forging ahead and shaping our lives, when it comes to actually opening ourselves to <em>the new</em>, we're loath to do it. This is ego. It's not so much that we really love transformation and evolution; it's that we crave the sense of control, the sense that it is all centered on "I, my, me", that <em>we</em> are the king and creator, and that <em>we</em> get to determine what will happen. It's the delusion and -- honestly -- the <em>terror</em> that goes with misunderstanding who you are in the first place. When you think of yourself as a solitary, separate, needy individual, you will then need to cling to an agenda of control, trying to become Lord and Master over all you survey. The very notion of 'letting it be' strikes fear into your heart. And even that fear itself has to be denied in order for us to maintain our sense of control.</p>
<p>We cling to opinion not because it is correct, but because it is something to hold, something that we secretly hope will quell our fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>This is the agitation that motivates humans: agitation with our essential openness, emotions, boundlessness. Thinking we are small and separate, we require denial and distance from spaciousness, change, and the unknown.</p>
<p>It becomes all the more urgent when we begin to realize that the very nature of reality is spacious, ever-changing, and unknown. We can only contribute labels and categories with our thinking, we don't actually get to hold onto anything.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>These are the things that propel us forward, that make us thrive, and in many ways that make and shape us as people.</em></p>
<p>If I give you a pat answer, you can then either say "yes, I agree with that" or "no, I don't agree with that". You can either affirm or reject -- put it in your pocket, or throw it out. Neither has any transformative effect. You will either get empty satisfaction of being confirmed in your upon or empty satisfaction of rejecting something (which provides a sense of control). What goes against the grain is to neither accept not reject, but <em>look</em>.</p>
<p>In looking, there is transformative possibility. But if you only defend what you already believe, you will not become anything new; and our conversation will easily be forgotten among the noise of the world -- all the other chatter that you accept, reject, or ignore. It is the ego that is behind this process. It is the ego's fear and desperate need for control that gives you the sense of what is reasonable or not. It is the ego's requirement for things to stay the same that is behind your unwillingness to take steps toward actually learning what Buddhism teaches.</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to stand here. You give it to me from over there. You convince me that I should take a step."</p>
<p>That's not how it works. That's not correct relationship with teaching. You have to make yourself into an appropriate vessel. You have to at 
the <em>opinion</em> that wanting motivates great human achievement. You don't know if it's true. <em>I'm not saying it's not true!</em> But you don't know. You haven't yet contacted the Tao, the force that moves through you and all beings spontaneously, bringing everything to fruition, harmonizing with everything else, bringing forth whatever new thing is necessary. You haven't yet experienced creative force that doesn't depend on wanting. You only have an idea that you cling to.</p>
<p>And of course we cling to ideas; because it comforts our ego to do so. It provides us with the sense that we <em>know</em> something, that we have things under control, hemmed in within the boundaries that <em>we</em> set, rather than open to the free movement of the world.</p>
<p>And the <em>type</em> of ideas we cling to also reflect our egoic needs. Maybe we require a particularly heroic personal philosophy. Maybe we feel ineffectual ourselves, hampered by circumstances and held back by timidity; so we adopt ideas that have a bold, cavalier quality. Maybe we feel a lack of meaning, so we drum up opinions that are very high-minded, opinions that could rouse a round of applause from a Roman Senate.</p>
<p>You don't actually know what is the case; you only have an idea to cling to, like floating on a scrap of wood from the Titanic.</p>
<p><em>Actual</em> knowing is radically different. It doesn't have to do with adopting or rejecting opinions. It doesn't follow the process of waiting for someone to convince you otherwise. <em>You</em> have to take steps into the unknown. <em>You</em> have to go against the river of ego, against the fear and control-seeking habit, and be willing to look without knowing.</p>
<p>Because any thought-based argument will only feed the thought-based view and the thought-based way of life and the thought-based palace of ego.</p>
<p><strong>Can you experience a moment directly, without the veil of opinion and philosophy?</strong></p>
<p>Can you have even a moment of true life?</p>
<p>This is the basis, the foundation. From that foundation, all thought and creation can proceed correctly; but without that foundation, you are living an illusion.</p>
<p>You think that all good achievements come from your wanting; so you must know who this 'you' is. Please tell me: who or what is this 'you' that is supposedly doing all these things? Tell me. Is it your body, your mind... what is this one who supposedly makes things happen?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; <em>This I don't agree with.</em></p>
<p>You didn't read what I wrote; you only read what was in your head. If you look carefully at what I wrote in the quoted  section, you'll see that you actually agree with what I said: we are always looking for something other than what we have. <em>You</em> added a judgment, expecting me or Buddhism to say that this is bad. So far, we are just pointing out that this is the case. Neither I not Buddhism make 'good' and 'bad'; we point out what is, and we point out the effects of particular causes.</p>
<p>So you are going too fast, caught up in your own opinion-based approach rather than seeing what is in front of you. This is actually the issue at hand: we don't live in the real world; we live in our thought-made one, reacting to our self-made ghosts.</p>
<p>'Acceptance' doesn't mean "you'll take this bullshit, and you'll like it"; 'acceptance' doesn't mean you are not allowed to exert influence and change things for the better. It means that <em>first</em> you need to get into the real world, and out of the thought-made delusion in which you live. You accept things as they are in order to be with the true situation; and from that basis you can harmonize. But no one wants to do that. Everyone wants to hold onto their view, their opinion, their sense of what's right, their favorite way, their expected outcome, their sense of justice. It's all ego, facilitated by remaining trapped in opinion and concept.</p>
<p>So this is why the teaching doesn't rush out to accommodate you, bantering about philosophies and opinions. It doesn't demean itself by becoming egocentric argument. It doesn't dilute itself by pretending to be about opinion. The teaching is what it is. It invites you to take a step out of <em>your</em> delusion, out of <em>your</em> fear and grasping. If you take a step, the teacher and teaching take a step. If you come halfway, the teacher and teaching come to meet you.</p>
<p>Don't insist on things being your way. Don't insist on the communication being what you expect or like to hear. If you do, you will never move point of your own old, stuck pattern.</p>
<p>And, as you've noted, the Buddhists you know are happier than you. It's often the case that trying to be <em>right</em> doesn't move in the direction of being <em>true</em> and <em>content</em>. When you give up that crusty structure of opinion, you'll get new life. The <em>ego</em> will experience anxiety, because new life is spacious, ever-changing, and unknown; but <em>you</em> will be happy and alive.   </p>
