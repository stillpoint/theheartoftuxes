  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It is all the present moment. Whatever's real is already practice.</p>
<p>Do consistent practice; and do more practice. Study with a teacher and practice group, and participate in retreats and residential practice. That will develop a strong center. You will learn how to apply meditation experience in life at large.</p>
<p>When you have a strong center, there is no such thing as distraction. You can take on more responsibility, more difficulty. You can happily engage with life.</p>
<p>Be careful of trying to groom your life into perfection; it can drive parts of you into the shadows. Instead focus on expressing the Dharma moment to moment, whatever the situation.</p>
<p>But until your center is strong it is indeed important to use environment and schedule to support your clarity.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing is to make your days about Dharma, not about arranging your life. Even if it seems positive, you can easily get caught up in details rather than the main point.</p>
<p>But when the main point is clear, everything else follows: priorities are put in order; you realize what to let go of and what to put effort into; you see better what possessions, activities, and relationships support the main point, and can make your choices accordingly.</p>
<p>So first is to be clear on the central point of your days. Studying with a teacher and group will help keep the central point central.</p>
<p>Next, cleanliness, order, balance, and simplicity are keywords to work with. Not all at once, but little by little, situation by situation.</p>
<p>Respect and support the body, because the body is the basis of practice. Without a body, what can you do to help yourself? Without health and vitality it will be hard to keep focus and consistency.</p>
<p>Keep the body clean. Wash the body early in the morning and wash the mind early in the morning, so the day is begun with freshness. Cleaning the body, remember the mountains of karma yet to be cleaned from your life, and enjoy the possibility of a fresh start.</p>
<p>You may like to wash hands and face whenever you return home, and also before each meditation session. Washing the feet before meditation is also a lovely ritual that reinforces the view of yourself as originally pure and noble-minded.</p>
<p>When ill, emphasize simplicity and ease even more. Ease -- not stagnation or laziness, but remaining in motion with the least amount of stress. If formal practices have to be curtailed due to illness or crisis, at least touch in with altar and practice daily. Three bows and a few moments of remembrance can almost always be done, no matter what what is going on, and establish in your deep mind the right order of things: whatever is going on in life, the central point is always there.</p>
<p>A chiming alarm every half hour or fifteen minutes can signal moments of non-doing and mindfulness throughout the day.</p>
<p>Don't spend too much care and money on adornment; wear clothing that suits the culture and occasion in which you find yourself. But do wear respectable, dignified, and comfortable clothing. Clothing supports your attitude and your energy. If it's too sloppy or too fancy, the mind suffers. If it's too tight or impractical, the body suffers. A simple wardrobe in which all pieces work with each other reduces the time wasted fussing with clothing or concerning yourself with how you look. Simplicity doesn't mean you can't look and feel great in your clothes. Comfort doesn't mean you need to be lazy or participate in slovenly activity.</p>
<p>Eat a simple and varied diet. If you know a handful of healthy, varied recipes you can plan meals and shopping all in one sitting. There's nothing wrong with having a repeating pattern of meals each week, so you don't have to stare at the fridge and figure out what to eat whenever mealtime comes around. A framework of regular meals can still be changed on particular occasions, but it frees the mind from always figuring.</p>
<p>Regulated schedule also frees the mind. You can know, basically, what you will be doing at particular times in the day. You can schedule not only work and social appointments, but also practice time, cleaning, cooking and eating, and personal care.</p>
<p>Clean and simple living environment frees tremendous amounts of mental energy. Appreciate space over possessions. Consider not only the benefit of having things but the benefit of not having them -- not being controlled by your possessions.</p>
<p>However rich or humble, however simple or ornate, a clean and orderly living space is very supportive of Dharmic mind. Clean your abode like you clean your mind in sitting practice and like you clean your character in active practice: don't compromise, don't leave messy spots. For example, the dishes are considered washed when the sink is spotlessly clean. Do even the smallest positive action; avoid even the smallest negative action.</p>
<p>Take care of the environment that allows you to live and practice. This means inside and outside of your home. First thing in the morning, either splash water on the face and immediately go to your mat for meditation, or do five minutes of tidying the living and practice space and refreshing the altar. In a family or shared home, some members can also clean outside and in the neighborhood. At sitting time, sit. If there's still more cleaning to be done when sitting time comes, get back to it after sitting. It's a content, grounded feeling when you start the day by cleaning the world.</p>
<p>Your mind and the world are not two different things. Clean one and the other together.</p>
<p>Schedule vigorous physical activity (enough to sweat), creative time or play, and rest (not only sleep, but gentle movement, calm walking, or relaxation practice) in every day.</p>
<p>Consider whether your relationships are serving the pursuit of truth and peace of mind, or distracting from it. If your center is strong, help others. If your center is weak, associate with those who are wiser and more clear than you (and also still help others, but don't be swallowed up in their dramas).</p>
<p>Open your living space to the elements. Clean the windows. Make windows, doors, drawers, and other infrastructure functional, so you're not fighting your environment. Fix what is broken. Replace what is used. Clean your mess.</p>
<p>Let in natural light, and follow the rhythm of the day. Minimize your use of electricity. Go along with the weather, being hot when it's hot, and adjusting by going slower, and being cold when it's cold, and adjusting by eating well, wearing more clothing, and getting good physical activity and good rest.</p>
<p>Let in the outside air. Periodically open every window and door in your living space, just as you ungrasp the doors of mind, heart, and senses in meditation. Enjoy the rain; enjoy the wind; enjoy the snow; enjoy the heat. Let the front stoop or local park take over from TV and internet. Follow in the footsteps of Thoreau, Gandhi, and Maha Ghosananda, and walk for the benefit of body and soul.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh, and also remember death daily. Take to heart that death is a certainty, and that the occasion of death is unknown.</p>
<p>Many spiritual traditions weave awareness of death into their daily rituals, and even practice the process of dying in visualized meditations. This is because awareness of death has a unique power to bring focus, urgency, and dedication to a life that otherwise tends to wander. It has a strong focusing and prioritizing effect on you.</p>
<p>The moment you wake up from sleep, you can piece the body together mindfully, and then acknowledge "This is a new day and a new chance. I am alive one more day, by a power that I don't control. I may die tomorrow, or before the end of this day. How will I use my time?"</p>
