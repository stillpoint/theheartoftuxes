  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Buddhism is not concerned with sacrilege. It is concerned with the <em>causes</em> that lead to freedom from suffering. So it doesn't really make a big deal about 'badness', sin, insult, and so on. Those things are important mostly in how they prevent you or others from absorbing the teaching and following the path of causes leading to liberation.</p>
<p>In this, all schools are unified.</p>
<p>As to the requirements of a particular school or lineage, we here can't rule on that; you have to consult the teachers and administrators of that school. Schools have various relationships with form, and for very good reasons; but the difference doesn't mean that you can dispense with or invent your own form.</p>
<p>So you can be a good person and a good Buddhist without being closely tied to a particular school. There are just certain repercussions. If you want to progress beyond your current status-quo, you need to expose yourself to something beyond your current patterns. "There is no progress without deviation from the norm."</p>
<p>There tend to be two very different ways of practicing apart from a school:  <strong>The first way is that of a person who assumes they already know what they need to know, and can figure it all out for themselves.</strong> This way is invariably permeated by ego, ignorance, and (though they don't acknowledge it) fear. It tends to require isolation -- so that nothing challenges the practitioner's favorite ways and opinions -- because the practice is built on such a shaky foundation. These people can only be comfortable when they have secured their own favorite situation; they can't venture out into new situations and encounters (and this inability and fear is itself is a looming, gnawing discomfort).</p>
<p><strong>The second kind of 'lone' practice is that of a person who has done considerable training, received deep and consistent teaching, and digested the key points to a level beyond mere thinking-understanding</strong>: the practice has been woven into their lives, they know how to keep their minds at any moment and in any situation (basically, they know what practice <em>is</em>), and they can use practice to work through any kind of trouble or crisis. This practitioner is capable of maintaining practice on their own, with only periodic contact with teacher and Sangha. It is because their center is exceptionally strong and clear; <em>not</em> just because they have a strong opinion or a strong desire to be alone.</p>
<p>The irony is that this second type of practitioner tends to be much more aware of the preciousness of good teaching, much more grateful and respectful of the teacher and the training settings and forms, and <em>much, much</em> more intent on offering compassion through practice than getting something for themselves. This practitioner has little problem going into all kinds of different situations, being led in different kinds of training, being tested by various teachers, and training intensely for long periods both with groups and in solitary isolation. After their core training, they may roam a bit, testing how adaptable they really are; but it's because they have already gained stability in one fundamental training. Essentially, every kind of situation is no problem for them. They are not moved much by their picking and choosing mind, and they don't have doubt about their practice: they only want to <em>do</em> it.</p>
<p>Trying to invent your own form is a bad idea -- not because it is 'wrong' in the sense of going against the rules, but because it sabotages your path. In the modern day, this attitude is called the 'dark side of self-help', which is that we are poorly equipped to help ourselves in isolation because <em>we don't see ourselves</em>. We need mirrors and guides.</p>
<p>It is that simple. You go to a teacher and path of training so you can go <em>beyond</em> your current ignorance, attachment, habit, and deep unconscious tendencies. <strong>If you invent your own path, your ignorance, attachment, habit, and deep unconscious tendencies are in control of the vehicle -- these blind spots and preferences get built into the path and control the outcome.</strong></p>
<p>And if you have the arrogance to continue in that way, and the fear of change that causes you to avoid the interactions that could transform you, <em>arrogance and fear</em> also get built into the path. (Though, like a great many, you may mistakenly think of it as pursuing 'my freedom'.) </p>
