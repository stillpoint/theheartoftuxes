  <h1>There are two things I don't want to give up. Can I still be buddhist?</h1>

<p>Maybe a good question is not at first whether you have to give something up to be a Buddhist, but rather <em>why</em> you want to be a Buddhist. If this is just to think well of yourself while indulging in the same harmful actions, that's definitely not the Buddhist way. And to try to find justification for harmful habits, whether from the story of Buddha's life or from some kind of authority or consensus on this forum, would not only not be the Buddhist way, it would be disingenuous and self-deceptive.</p>
<p>So, why do you want to be Buddhist? Is there a sincere motivation? Is it because you sincerely align with the aspiration to free yourself (and all others) from selfishness and suffering? Being a Buddhist arises from a real awareness of cause and effect. One sees one’s own painful cycle and genuinely aspires to escape it. If your motivation is sincere, then it doesn't matter whether you are called a Buddhist or not. You only follow the truth that moves in you. The Buddha wasn't Buddhist; he only followed his sincere mind.</p>
<p>Buddhism is not rule-based, but compassion-based and wisdom-based. Both compassion and wisdom are necessary. The Buddha way is not judgmental about good and bad, but <em>points out cause and effect</em>. What we make, we get. So we try to perceive this cause and effect functioning. Very few people are clear about cause and effect; and while Buddhists also vary in their level of clarity, they <em>try</em> to become more clear. The basic, shared, understanding is that behaviors born of craving and aggression and ignorance all lead to suffering, and keep us from waking up out of suffering. </p>
<p>So it is not a case of “can I or can’t I” or “tell me if this is justifiable”, but of seeing for yourself the effects of your actions – on your own mind and on the lives of the other beings involved.</p>
<p>The first step on the Noble Eightfold Path is right view. Everything else on the path begins from that. So before forcing yourself into one way or another, the dedication to <em>see</em> more completely and clearly is vital. It is vital because everything else springs from your experience of the truth, and it is vital also in the sense that real life is there, not some artificial system of rules imposed on you.</p>
<p>What would it be like to deeply look into eating meat, to make yourself aware of everything, in meticulous detail, from getting to know the animals to seeing how they live and die, how the flesh is processed, what other beings are involved and in what ways, how it gets to you, and what effect eating it has on your physical and emotional and mental condition? What would it be like to look very honestly and deeply into relationships with women, the source of the desire that underlies them, how they arise and how they end up? You may reach a point where your curiosity and drive to see clearly bring you to experiment or challenge yourself to try going about things differently; or you may find the issue resolved. But at least you will have looked.</p>
<p>It is seldom a good idea to force a structure upon yourself. Trying to make yourself quit something just plants a seed of resentment that will grow in you; part of your mind will resist being repressed, and will create a powerful backlash. So rather than, on the one hand, trying to be completely pure in your behaviour or, on the other hand, giving up Buddhism or giving up trying to live a better life, why not just take the next <em>little</em> step? There are many ways to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>learn about modern 'meat' farming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eat meals in mindful silence, with awareness of how the food has come to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eat <em>less</em> meat per meal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eat fewer meat-based meals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a meat-free day once or twice a week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a meat free week, maybe during meditation retreat</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…and so on. I wouldn't demand any of these; but you may find you want to try, just to see for yourself without having to rely on anyone else's opinion. Anyway, even if for no other reason, it is important and healthy for men to challenge themselves, lest they become soft and self-indulgent and lose their bearings in life.</p>
<p>The middle way is a good way; but also let’s remember that we have developed so many mind-clouding habits that extreme self-indulgence and extreme dullness have become our ‘normal’. The <em>true</em> middle way is a lot more rigorous than we may expect at first; and peace and clarity may even feel foreign and uncomfortable in comparison to our usual condition.</p>
