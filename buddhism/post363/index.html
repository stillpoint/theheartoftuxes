  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'm always puzzled why someone would ask this of participants in an online forum, many of whom may not even have any training experience, much less awakening and expertise in stabilizing it.</p>
<p>Go to someone who knows. See a Zen Master and/or Dzogchen Master. Actually, consult with a <em>few</em> masters over the coming months, to ensure that you don't miss or avoid certain issues. Get checked on your experience. If it was real, you can get practical instruction going forward. If it was not real, much better to know sooner and adjust than to proceed under an illusion.</p>
<p>Take appropriate time, and return to the Masters for clarification and training. Many people will just leave and write off a teacher when they don't hear what they want to hear; but there is a good reason why the Master has attained his/her role. Without your appropriate humility, even authentic attainment is tainted.</p>
<p>If you are serious about refining your awakening, you need to submit to a course of training.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> What many new meditators call 'awakening' is really just a first taste of emptiness or true nature. This glimpse can be experienced by almost anyone, by dint of consistent practice or just through the grace of the moment (based on conducive conditions). Although significant, it is not a big deal, and not enough to go on in practice. Attachment to the experience and making stories about it only leads off the path.</p>
<p>Some traditional courses of training concentrate methods and efforts at getting that first taste quickly. The thought is that the experience will be a guiding light as one then continues in situational training, developing ethics, character, relationship, conception, healthy routines, and so on. But this tends to put things in the wrong order, and these paths are notorious for promoting an aggressive approach and being a breeding ground for shadow constructs (aspects of self pushed into unconsciousness in attempt to live up to the initial 'special' experience).</p>
<p>Although everyone's path differs, and almost none follow a classical, linear route, the more apt and natural process involves creating the proper basis first — or as soon as possible. This means clarifying life direction/motivation, training embodiment, and establishing correct attitude. When motivation is correct, any kind of experience — high or low, pleasant or unpleasant — can be digested and can become wisdom. When motivation is not correct, even authentic insight is soon co-opted by egoic concerns and resident patterns of ignorance.</p>
<p>The right foundation is necessary. As in the process of growing up in common life, if you miss certain developmental lessons in childhood you will only have to learn them later in life. There is not way to cheat on this. And though it is possible to integrate childhood issues later in life, it usually requires a great deal of effort and entails repeated setbacks. Similarly, in spiritual life the foundation is important: <em>Why</em> practice? Only for oneself, only to 'get' knowledge and abilities? Many people can't even <em>conceive</em> of higher motivations until they are pointed out and modeled by a teacher and very devoted practitioners; or if they do conceive of higher motivations, they remain as mere conception and not integrated into life in any real way. This is where training is indispensable.</p>
<p>Embodiment is also crucial. Many people can get special experiences and insights. They are not really so special. But not many people can embody them — putting them in the body, in the momentary activity of daily life. Our online culture cuts us off at the neck, creating divided people — people who think, think, think, but can't communicate with and through the body. Lofty spiritual experience often only increases the rift, as the meditator goes swooning into space and leaves the body, relationship, and accountability to the world behind. This is not compassion; this is not attainment. So embodiment is another important foundational issue that can only be developed in training.</p>
<p>Attitude also is much better corrected at the onset. Because when wrong attitude is carried on over time and in isolation (as is the case for many online meditators) it becomes entrenched as habit and view. One sees through the filter of wrong attitude; one judges teachings through that filter; one judges one's experiences, strengths, and faults through it. It becomes increasingly difficult to let go of one's opinion and habit, and return to right mind, right openhanded, non-manipulative, non-grasping, non-avoiding attitude. We all suffer from this, which is why we meditate in the first place; but many meditators willingly shun teaching. They avoid any situation where the light will be shone on their character and understanding; they reject all transformative situations, and only try to preserve their own favorite view and approach.</p>
<p>These three elements — right motivation, embodiment, and attitude — are the main reasons why so many thousands upon thousands of meditators try and try but don't ever really transform their lives. They are the main reasons why pure and hard-won experiences get frittered away, becoming mere memories. The rise and fall of Samsara swamps you if you don't have unconditional motivation and stable embodiment and attitude. These are trained, passed on by those who have already advanced far down the path, and who can always hold the unmoving, boundless view.</p>
<p>These teachings are passed on <em>in relationship</em>. It is necessary to be there with the teacher, going through real life. Reading and thinking and practicing in isolation are not enough. The situational teaching is what refines the initial awakening. Emptiness is the essence, but how it functions in life is the crucial point. How can you use that view and trust it — unquestioningly, spontaneously — when you're working, when you're falling in love, when you're faced with pettiness or anger, when you encounter overwhelming suffering, when sexual energy rises, when your children need you, and so on, and so on. How does that one clear point function in life? This requires ongoing, in-person training from someone who has digested all of that already.</p>
