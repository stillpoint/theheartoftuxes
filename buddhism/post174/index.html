  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I understand your concern that someone may be imagining Buddha's emotional response; but by the same token, many people tend to imagine Buddha as distant and uninvolved. It's just the other side of the same coin.</p>
<p>Dispassion doesn't mean lack of care, and in this case profound, boundless, unimaginable care. For instance, after his enlightenment the story goes that Buddha was visited by Indra who implored him to teach the Dharma. At first Buddha was reticent because all sentient beings — all of us — are 'covered with dust', but the Buddha's compassion won over and he determined to teach, because some of us are only 'a little bit covered'.</p>
<p>This may be an apocryphal myth to highlight Buddha's compassionate intent and our great fortune. To think we could be <em>without</em> his teaching! Without his tremendous care and determination to save others, none of this teaching, including the many lineages (and including Mahasi Sayadaw's) would have been made available to us. The Buddha doesn't <em>need</em> to teach or offer anything. He's already complete! Job finished! It's not like he was looking for something to do. But he taught and practiced with others for 49 years after his enlightenment. It's all because of compassion.</p>
<p>And our awakened teachers are also like this. They don't teach for their own sakes, to feel important or seem like an expert; they teach for us, for us, for us....</p>
<p>The Buddha sees through illusion — completely and without a trace of misunderstanding. So he knows that no sentient being exists and that all suffering is empty. But sentient beings don't know that. <em>We</em> continue to suffer. And the response of original, awakened Buddha-mind is tremendous compassion. Although the suffering is empty, it is still experienced as real.</p>
<p>It is like the way that you might care for some being weaker and less capable than yourself. For example, if you came across a dog with a broken leg, would you think "this is just happenstance, not real; my job is to detach myself from the situation"? Or would you offer practical care and emotional solace to the suffering dog?</p>
<p>Some people, in fact, <em>would</em> walk by and remove themselves emotionally. That is not enlightenment, that is perversion of the heart. Even a child understands correct relationship in this case. Buddha has just perfected the compassion, abolished its sentimentality, and liberated the compassion to a boundlessness far beyond that which a separate, ignorant, self-centered being can muster. Inconceivable compassion doesn't mean lack of care; it means <em>we</em> don't understand it. But as you practice and as your heart becomes purified, you can see it growing in that direction. You can experience instances of unconditional love moving through you.</p>
<p>Wisdom is the central point beyond relationship. Compassion is how it functions in relationship. If one aspect is missing, there is no enlightenment, no completion.</p>
<p>As to insight and tranquility, in Mahasi Sayadaw's tradition (as in some other traditions) they are trained separately so each can be developed meticulously and fully. Other traditions differ, but in many Vipassana streams it has been found effective to practice the two separately for a time.</p>
<p>Similar to the issue of illusory beings, words and concepts are also illusory. But just as beings have a reality in their own experience, words and concepts have a reality and usefulness in our relative realm. There is only one reality, but we use concepts to separate things out and point the way. You can know that insight and tranquility are originally not separate, but you can still talk about insight and tranquility in skillful ways.</p>
<p>Take care about judging your teachers. It is so easy to take a haughty and judgmental position when reading. It is easy to point the finger at others. It is enabled by the distance and anonymity we indulge in. But that is just the habit of the ignorant mind. To the ego it seems very reasonable and necessary. "Yes, of course I should judge things and determine what is best for me." Unbeknownst to us it is an expression of the ingrained ignorance, a lack of enlightened humility.</p>
<p>This is a very similar distancing to the emotional distancing I was talking about earlier. The ego does it. The ego separates and distances, so it can keep its reign over us. Our ignorant habit is to hold onto our views, our opinions, our way of seeing and doing things, and to always expect to understand everything. When we don't immediately see the purpose for a teaching, of course the ego feels threatened — we never want to be uncertain! So rather than admit and experience the <em>truth</em> of our not-knowing, we start checking and judging and pointing fingers. For the most part, we are petulant children that our teachers put up with, and they demonstrate tremendous patience and care in continuing to teach us despite our arrogance.</p>
<p>That egocentric habit maintains its domain by avoiding all things uncertain, unknowable, expansive, subtle, intimate — anything that threatens the crystallized self-image. So <em>deep feeling</em>, for instance is a no-no for the ego. Compassion that melts the boundary between me and you is out. Patience to rest in unknowing and entrust oneself to the teaching is out. Letting go of the grand framework of opinion is out. <em>Experiencing</em> practice (rather than thinking about it) is out.</p>
<p>So this shows us how our own resistance gets projected onto our teachers. <em>We</em> are afraid of letting go; so we attempt to gain a sense of control by checking and judging teachers and teachings.</p>
<p>Even knowing this, we will still succumb to the judging and conceptualizing habit — perhaps even the very moment we end this conversation.</p>
<p>I think most beginners and intermediate practitioners have little to no idea of the negative effect of trying to learn through their own thinking. They don't yet know their own blind spots and attachments deeply, and they filter the teaching based on them. All this reading and talking only encourages 'practice' to be up in the head, where most people expect it to be. But that's not the place of practice. Practice is in the abode of Buddha, not in the abode of thinking/judging.</p>
<p>So it often happens that people trying to guide their own practice become attached to emptiness, not realizing that it is only one side of practice, and not realizing that their fixation on it is just another way of distancing themselves rather than letting the self melt.</p>
<p>Some teachers are good for some people and not others. Mahasi Sayadaw is somewhat polarizing in this sense; but his is still a great and accomplished practitioner and teacher. Don't judge him until you've attained what he attained. If you were to actually spend time with a great teacher, the experience would be very, very, very different than the scene in your head.</p>
<p>Remember: the ego maintains its control by distancing and separating. Refusal to feel and insistence on conceptualizing are its two major strategies. When you see this distancing reaction in yourself you can consider what's really going on.</p>
<p>Practice lives in the abode of Buddha, not in the thinking-judging mind.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This video also posted today is apropos: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/50mh2n/ajahn_maha_boowa_weeps_with_pity_for_us_all/">Ajahn Maha Boowa weeps with pity for us all</a></p>
<p>See also the teaching of Bodhicitta:</p>
<p>&gt;The enlightened attitude, bodhicitta, which has love and compassion as its basis, is the essential seed producing the attainment of buddhahood. Therefore, it is a subject that should be approached with the pure thought, “May I gain enlightenment in order to be of greatest benefit to the world.”</p>
<p>&gt;If we want to attain the state of the full enlightenment of buddhahood as opposed to the lesser enlightenment of an arhat, nirvana, our innermost practice must be cultivation of bodhicitta. If meditation on emptiness is our innermost practice, we run the risk of falling into nirvana instead of gaining buddhahood. This teaching is given in the saying, “When the father is bodhicitta and the mother is wisdom, the child joins the caste of the buddhas.”</p>
<p>&gt; – Lama Yeshe, <a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/article/generating-bodhicitta"><em>Generating Bodhicitta</em></a></p>
<p>The mother gives birth; the father introduces the child to the world. So as I said above, Wisdom is the mother, the original mind; Compassion is the father, the relationship with the world of beings. Both are necessary for complete enlightenment.</p>
