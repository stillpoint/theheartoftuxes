  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>You don't have to forgive if it's not yet sincere. There may be something else that needs to happen first.</p>
<p>Also, you can forgive and still hold a clear boundary. Is that something you need to learn?</p>
<p>Usually we get those faculties from our parents, and of the parent we model our role in relationship after was not good at holding boundaries, it's likely that we won't be good at it ourselves, and we'll have to make a conscious effort to develop that capacity.</p>
<p>On the other side, your partner should want to do better; the impetus should come from him. After a mistake or mistreatment, his own sense of regret and care should lead him to correct the situation, make amends, and <em>ask</em> for forgiveness. It is then possible for you two to have equal roles in healing the relationship.</p>
<p>Effort on both sides should be made with a compassionate, respectful heart. Otherwise the gestures are empty. If your partner promises to change but doesn't mean it, only making an empty promise to avoid further confrontation, you need to look into the reason care is not present. Sometimes people cling to relationship just to not feel lonely, not because it is actually working well or supportive of awakening together. Sometimes the motive for relationship is more twisted or even sinister, for instance to maintain a sense of superiority, to suppress a side of one's character (in men, often the feminine side), to feel 'in control', and so on. It should be clear that your partner actually wants relationship for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Likewise, there should be a natural heart of forgiveness behind your response, not just forcing yourself to give him a pass. If the overarching thought for you is "I <em>should</em> forgive him", maybe there's something else you need to listen to in your own experience. Emotions are teachers; they point to inner truths. Fear, anger, sadness, frustration, emptiness, disappointment, and other emotions point to things within you calling for your attention. <em>You</em> have to be whole. <em>You</em> have to have integrity. <em>That's</em> the important thing, not merely being a 'Dharma robot' and going through the motions of seeming nice.</p>
<p>Your own wholeness and fulfillment are extremely important. It's they only way you will have a real life, or a real life together with someone, or a real life of benefit to the world. The world needs you to be whole, not to shut down parts of yourself to avoid rocking the boat.</p>
<p>In relationship most issues come down to communication. Tragically, these two useful and necessary abilities in life -- how to hear and respect your own emotions, and how to communicate well in relationship -- are not taught in most schools.</p>
<p>Good communication takes some effort at first because we are not used to it; but it gets easier, and it is far less exhausting -- because it doesn't go against your inner truth. In fact, good communication is enlivening; it brings much positive energy to a relationship, if the partners both basically care for each other. (And if care is not present, good communication can quickly make that clear, so the right steps can be taken to move on.)</p>
<p>Fortunately there are many resources available for learning and practicing communication. Non-Violent Communication is a simple, helpful framework based on the notion that our carrying response emerges naturally once we understand the other person's need. I highly recommend NVC as part of the 'adult toolkit'.</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh has written and spoken a lot on compassion in relationship. He offers practices to maintain mindfulness throughout the various situations that arise. I recommend his book <em>True Love: A Practice For Awakening The Heart</em>, among other teachings. In the book, he offers four aspects of love, with four corresponding phrases that act as reminders and mindfulness practices. (This has been expanded to <a href="http://tnhaudio.org/2012/07/13/the-six-mantras/">Six Mantras</a> of Love.)</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh is a great example of integrity. He radiates compassion everywhere and in every moment; but he is far from a pushover! His peace activism has been relentless, holding authorities to a standard of integrity (holding the boundary), bearing witness to wrongdoing (speaking the truth), and mobilizing effective change (taking action). These are good examples for one-on-one relationship too.</p>
<p>Another tool I'd like to mention is the Hawaiian mantra <em>ho'oponopono</em>. It is not strictly Buddhist, but it is a wonderful practice for both parties to come into their sincere, caring hearts. Repeating the mantra, one also recalls its four qualities or aspects: "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you." You can both repeat these phrases a dozen times or more, followed by a few repetitions of the mantra. (A strong emphasis on the first syllable <em>ho'</em> is said to cut off the ego that is at the root of all problems.) It brings you to your right heart.</p>
<p>A truly compassionate heart is strong, not weak. Only caving in to cruelty <em>does not help the offender</em>. It is not compassionate, but only continues their burden of neglectful, abusive behavior. It doesn't engender happiness.</p>
<p>By the same token, only thinking "I must be strong" and then becoming rigid in your reactions is also not compassionate.</p>
<p>Compassion must have a reality, a real life in the heart. The inclusive care must be real. It is not achieved by going through motions that 'look' like compassion. It is only expressed when the heart embraces all involved: both sides of an argument, and all surrounding beings. It is for the integrity of both, and all.</p>
