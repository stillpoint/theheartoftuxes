  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This is all your thinking. It is not your real situation. So you should know the illusory quality of thought, and not lend credence to it.</p>
<p>I've known people who would <em>daily</em> travel one or two hours to practice at the Zen Center. Judging that it's too far or too difficult is also illusory thinking. For the mind of aspiration, nothing is too difficult; and in fact any difficulty only brings to light the heart of devotion and effort. It is a joyful process. Thinking-judging taints it. This is thinking-judging is called 'checking'. It is the number one problem among spiritual practitioners.</p>
<p>When the mind steps outside of the situation to look at and assess what's happening to 'me', that's checking. Number one bad habit.</p>
<p>So, what constitutes 'progress'? You say that you are not progressing; so what is your idea of progressing? You expect certain results besides the ones you have identified. This is the insidious effect of thinking, of checking.</p>
<p>For instance, you have been going to the Zen Sangha weekly. You brought yourself there although it was an unknown situation. You overcame the obstacles to attending.</p>
<p>Further, you now have a home altar, where before there was none. You make offerings and you do meditation.</p>
<p>How is this all not progress?</p>
<p>But if you have a gaining idea, it is not progress.</p>
<p>If you make an offering sincerely, that is a pure offering, and its effect is inestimable -- beyond our ability to voice or conceive. But if you make an offering with a gaining idea -- i.e., with the thought that you are doing it in order to get some reward for yourself -- then it is not pure; it is limited. You yourself create the limitation.</p>
<p>Likewise, a moment of pure meditation is beyond normal human life. It is expression of the awakened mind, of complete reality. So we sit as the universe expressing itself, not as an individual trying to get something. If instead you sit as an individual trying to get something, you limit the situation with your thinking. You disempower the practice.</p>
<p>Checking and gaining idea go hand-in-hand. They feed each other. It's not that you don't progress, but your thinking about the whole situation is limited. You have made it about 'I, my, me' and "How much am I getting?" That is not pure practice, and therefore it doesn't deliver boundless, unlimited results; it delivers narrow, relative, self-centered results.</p>
<p>As you learn and practice, you will come to gradually digest the true limitless spirit of practice. <strong>Only do it.</strong> <em>That</em> is progress. Live this moment with limitless mind, only offering yourself to it. Then you have limitless life for this moment. You participate in the whole universe and liberate it with the mind that goes beyond self-centeredness.</p>
<p>So you must be aware of the illusory nature of your thinking. You are not in a position to judge your progress. Only a fully enlightened being can know what is happening in the not-yet-manifest process (the fruit still within the fruit tree). Let go of checking at every turn. Know when you are judging, and drop it immediately. Judging creates judging results; pure practice creates pure results.</p>
<p>Throw yourself into the abode of Buddha. Only do it! Only do what you are doing in the moment. That is boundless practice. The universe unfolds itself. If on the other hand you keep yourself separate from the moment, thinking of yourself as a separate being and trying to gain something, you will then get the results of that separation, and your progress will be limited.</p>
<p>This is why Bodhicitta (the mind of compassion) is hailed in Mahayana and Vajrayana practice as the basis of all attainment. Everything worth attaining in practice arises from the wish to benefit others. This is the limitless mind. All difficulty and limitation come from the wish to gain things for the illusory self. This is the limiting mind.</p>
<p>Zen also has this teaching, but doesn't call it Bodhicitta. The first vows of the day, and the first vows of any ceremony are vows of the limitless mind:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Although sentient beings are numberless, I vow to save them all</em></p>
<p>This is not an empty ritual or just idle speech. It points to the very basis of practice, the basic motivation behind every effort. Not checking, not judging, not measuring and weighing how much you're getting, but only working to benefit others, to ease their suffering, to act without contrivance and be a pure influence in the world.</p>
<p>The vows continue:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Although delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to overcome them ("to cut through them all").</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Although the teachings are infinite, I vow to fathom them all.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Although the Buddha Way is beyond conception, I vow to attain it.</em></p>
<p>These vows all point to how you should keep your mind. The motivation moves outward, radiating. Your energy and mind radiate from your center, boundlessly outward. The energy and mind should not turn around and look back on how you're doing, what you're gaining, how far or how fast you're traveling, and so on. When the mind circles back, that is checking. That is limiting mind. Only offer yourself to momentary life, without clutching.</p>
<p>When you sit, be relaxed and awake. This is only sitting, pure sitting. When you take food, do it together with the universe, not only for your small, limited, illusory self. When you walk to the Zen Sangha, only walk; don't think of what's worth it or not, or of what you'll gain by doing it. When you practice with others, express your moment to moment Dharma rather than always seeking something from them.</p>
<p>Beginners have their beginner Dharma to offer, which is very precious, and can help many others. Intermediate students have their intermediate Dharma to offer, which is very precious, and can help many others. Advanced practitioners have their advanced Dharma to offer, which is very precious, and can help many others.</p>
<p>Moment to moment, only do it. Progress is already taking care of itself, as surely as the seasons turn.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'll just point out that reading books has limited benefit, and we tend to rely on them far too much. While we think we're gaining inspiration and knowledge (which may sometimes be true), the bulk of the experience is strengthening the greedy, gaining mind-habit and enhancing the concept-based attitude that brings so much delusion into practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the more concepts we gather, the more our checking mind is fed, and the more complications develop in our minds.</p>
<p>The general attitude regarding reading is very much in opposition to true practice. True practice has a very, very simple and unadorned mind. It is a mind that clings to nothing, seeking no 'kit' but rather relying on its own deep well as the sole resource. But our approach to reading is usually in direct opposition to this: We seek to gain and hold ideas. We think we need them, more, and more, and more of them. We think of ourselves as lacking, and don't recognize the deep well of resources we already possess. And even when confusion sets in from going too fast, or taking teachings out of context, or mixing methods and traditions and teachers, we think the solution is to gain more. We simply don't yet trust our simple, unadorned mind.</p>
<p>One Zen Master calls this indigestion. When you take in ideas without practicing, they remain undigested like an immense meal sitting in your gut. Only by <em>doing</em> moment to moment practice can you digest teachings and make them your own.</p>
<p>After a certain point, reading becomes more of a problem for practitioners than a benefit. And that point tends to be sooner rather than later, though of course we deny it and cling hungrily to concepts.</p>
<p>After the first introductory explorations, I've seen reading become a big obstacle to progress for hundreds, if not thousands, of students.</p>
