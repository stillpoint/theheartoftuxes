<hr />
<p>When you can't tame the mind directly you have to initially use external means — environment, relationship, schedule, physical practice....</p>
<p><strong>The body is the primary means of grounding a wild mind.</strong> The more physically present you are, the more anchoring effect it has on the mind. (This doesn't mean controlling the mind by only having certain thoughts or responses; it means having the ability to disengage — to not be <em>kidnapped</em> by thoughts and responses.) So <strong>taking care of the body and regulating the body</strong> — bringing it to balance — are very powerful ways to help bring the wild mind to a point where you can actually work with it and make progress, rather than an endless up-and-down cycle.</p>
<p>I agree with another commenter that your first target should be <strong>bringing your drinking under control</strong>. Intoxication, as you already know, is the gateway to a thousand other bad actions. In itself, intoxication is already delusion — your remove yourself from reality; but it also makes it difficult if not impossible for you to see clearly, judge correctly, maintain a real view, and live up to your true dignity. The moment you become drunk, you open the door to a chain of bad action, self-blame, further escape and further bad action; and this could very easily become a chain of events that ruin you. Some decisions you can come back from; other decisions are drastically life-altering. Drunkenness makes it far more possible for you to do something that will seriously harm you or others.</p>
<p>So whatever good things you may do for yourself, and whatever merit you may gain through good actions, it could all be swept away through intoxicated wrong view or wrong action. Therefore, your drinking (and other addiction) is the first thing to be dealt with. You may find that this journey actually addresses much of the rest of your issues.</p>
<p>In addition to finding appropriate support in treatment of excessive or addictive behavior, there are some very clear things you can do to help yourself. As I wrote above, the body is your primary ally in staying grounded. So take care of your ally and strengthen its grounding influence in your life. <strong>Take care of the physical basics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sleep</strong> (balanced sleep schedule)</li>
<li><strong>food</strong> (balanced diet — not too much, not too little, and on a regular schedule; healthy food)</li>
<li><strong>exercise</strong> (regular daily full-body-and-breath activity, balanced with calm, restful activity)</li>
<li><strong>cleanliness</strong> (regular daily bathing and body care)</li>
</ul>
<p>These basics will help your life. If they are attended to carefully, they have the power to change your life and turn around many addictions and other difficulties; but even making simple baby-steps toward balance will prove helpful.</p>
<p>When the body is out of balance, it makes the mind dull and/or agitated (both at the same time is common). It's another type of intoxication, making it more difficult for you to be in touch with your authentic thoughts and feelings. When the body is out of balance, it feels uncomfortable, and there will be a frequent urge to escape the discomfort through impulsive sensual actions — drinking, sex, gaming, smoking, drugs, gambling, raging, binging on tv, etc. As the body comes back into balance, the mind will <em>naturally</em> calm down — you don't even have to do anything else, you will just automatically be more calm and stable.</p>
<p>The next steps include <strong>taking care of your immediate environment/living space, and your relationships</strong>, so that they can support your clarity and dignity rather than incite your pettiness and attachment.</p>
<p>Your <strong>environment</strong> starts with your body and extends out from there, so the first part of arranging a supportive environment is cleaning and caring for the body (as above). If you live like an animal (as many of us do, sometimes or all the time), make a point of <strong>keeping your body and clothes meticulously clean and tidy</strong>. Bathe, shower, or otherwise wash several times a day. If the mind is turning to low-class, sub-human thoughts, offer yourself clear water by washing your face and having a cool drink of water. This is actually an offering to your true mind, which is clear like pure water and open like space; it makes your connection to your true mind stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Arrange your living space</strong> so that it is clean, orderly, easy to use, and sends you messages of spaciousness, peace, and nobility rather than confusion and denegration. You can't arrange everything at once, but you can start by clearing one space, which will become your touchstone, your reminder and connection to your true mind. If you want, you can make a small clear space somewhere and keep clear water and a candle on it, to strengthen your connection even more.</p>
<p>Notice what you see when your eyes move around your room. Do your eyes get to take in restful space and images of beauty and dignity? A fresh flower or image of the Buddha can speak to your mind even when you don't notice it, sending messages of harmony and encouraging you to return to contentment, to your true self. In this way your environment provides a support that is there for you when you least expect it and when you need it most.</p>
<p>So the reason for keeping your place clean isn't "because mommy says so"; it's to help you remember and return to your original nature, which is pure and clear and spacious. Your mind makes your environment; your environment conditions your mind.</p>
<p>To this point, all of the above guidelines will be very helpful. Don't expect to overhaul your whole life in one fell swoop, though. <strong>Be realistic</strong>. Step by step. You must understand that there <em>will</em> be ups and downs; there will be difficulty; there will be failure. Don't let that keep you from working toward balance.</p>
<p>At first things swing around here and there, then little by little they get better; but even if there is a big setback, <em>it's what you do next</em> that makes the difference. The addictive mind often uses difficulty and failure as an excuse to go off the deep end and binge. In this sense, simple being aware <em>does</em> save you: aware that you are using failure as a reason to indulge, you can let it go.</p>
<p>Letting go of the addictive impulse should not be seen as forcing it to disappear, making it go away, destroying it, or pushing it down forcefully. Of course we all know what happens then if we do: it comes back with more energy. Letting go means it's okay. It's okay to feel this yearning or vulnerability or discomfort. It's okay to not know what to do. <strong>Just for this moment, being with this situation is okay.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us haven't developed the strength of practice to maintain letting-be over the period of time it takes for addictive impulses to dissipate on their own. So I recommend <strong>changing the channel: just quickly do something else</strong>. It pretty much doesn't matter what it is, so long as it is a positive, or at least neutral activity. Just immediately start to do something else. You might find a go-to activity like hopping on your bike or going to a café (not pub) to read.</p>
<p>Natural outdoor settings tend to be calming and healing. You might visit a park where people are calmly enjoying the day. If you stay aware, you'll start to identify which settings serve as triggers for your addictive impulses, and which help dissipate them. So you can keep to the environments that support you.</p>
<p>When the addictive impulse (or the preceding thought about it) arises, <strong>changing your posture and physical viewpoint</strong> can be surprisingly effective. Straighten up, or stand, or turn around, or walk to another room, or take a walk out the door. Just changing what your eyes see and changing the setup of your body can help disengage from the addictive pattern. Catching the thought or impulse early on is key, so you avoid building it up into something that you fight with and that eventually (in your self-created story) becomes too strong for you to avoid. (It is never too strong for you; you just decide that it is.)</p>
<p>One useful tool is a <strong>mindfulness bell</strong>. Get a timer or use an app on your phone or computer that alerts you every 15 minutes. A timer with a nice bell sound is pleasant, but any timer will do. When that bell or alarm goes off, come to an upright, relaxed, awake posture and just reset for a moment, with nothing else to do. Thus you'll not only have a chance to head off unconscious behavior, you'll also strengthen your connection to your true, noble self many times a day.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong> can also be either supportive of your clear, dignified nature or triggers for your pettiness and attachment. So likewise, relationships are to be regulated. <strong>Find friends or a practice community that value compassion and awakening</strong>, and let go of (so-called) friends that drag you down into low-mindedness. If there is reason to maintain contact with negative influences, then minimize it — have a coffee together and then move on, for example.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if someone can't even bring themselves to apply these healing actions? Then you have to <strong>submit yourself to a trustworthy structure that will do it for you</strong>. In extreme cases of drug addiction, for example, this means going to rehab. In the case of a spiritual seeker who can't control his own life, he may seek out a practice community and teacher. If such a resource is available, one may give up many aspects of one's old life and offer oneself, body-and-soul, to the guidance of a teacher and the schedule and rules of a residential practice center. In the old days it might mean living in the ashram of an awakened master; these days it might mean living in an urban residential practice place for a while.</p>
<p>The <strong>teacher, community, schedule, and environment then hold the boundaries</strong> that the person is not yet able to hold themselves, until that strength is developed and the harmful habits are replaced by functional and beneficial behaviors.</p>
