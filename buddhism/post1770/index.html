  <h1>Does Buddhism as a religion have any negative connotation with psychedelic drugs such as LSD or Psycobilin Mushrooms?</h1>

<p>Buddhism has precepts against intoxicants. Those precepts are interpreted narrowly or widely by different teachers, but because there is a sincere desire to be thorough, for the most part the interpretation is wide and the definition of "intoxicant" includes all kinds of substances and technologies and behaviors that make the mind unclear and don't contribute to awakening. So the million dollar question is "does this contribute to awakening or get in the way of it?"</p>
<p>When looking at the use of psychedelics — or really with any choice that drastically influences your mind — the two major points that have to be considered are <em>direction</em> and <em>effect</em>.</p>
<p>Direction means intent or aim or purpose. This is all-important. Some activities tend to be beneficial, some tend to be harmful (to oneself or others), and others tend to be neutral; but what all activities have in common is that one's intention has a tremendous influence on their effect. <em>Why</em> use mind-altering drugs? <em>Why</em> meditate? <em>Why</em> do anything in life? <em>Why</em> stay alive? All of these questions boil down to the central question in life. When that question is clear, then all kinds of activities can be clear; when that question is not clear, then all kinds of activities will not be clear.</p>
<p>So one should sincerely and carefully look into the motivation for making these kinds of choices. When you're honest with yourself, what is the aim? Is it simply to awaken? If so, then are drugs the most effective method, or an effective method at all? (That brings one to the next major point: the cause-and-effect relationship of the activity.) But if one is honest with oneself, is the aim something more like "I want to get out of my usual mind, and I don't want to do a lot of work to get there"? I'm not saying this is necessarily the aim, but it's certainly an aim that crops up for most of us, much of the time.</p>
<p>The next point is cause and effect. What actually <em>does</em> happen when one chooses an action? In this case, what <em>are</em> the effects of LSD or Psilocybin, not only in how they affect the mind in the short term, but in how they influence your mind and your life over the longer run?</p>
<p>Along with this, one should take into account one's own particular situation. Although one can make use of anecdotal and research information, one should take it all with a grain of salt and understand that both these kinds of information come from particular perspectives that may not be complete. It is important to know and take into account your own situation and character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does your mind easily attach — do you have an addictive character?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you seeking escape?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is your constitution strong or weak — are you easily unbalanced, physically, emotionally, or mentally?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a good support system in your life, a "safe place to fall" if structures within your mind get quickly broken down?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a context that can digest an "epiphany" if it occurs — a regular practice, a stable spiritual guide, clear spiritual friends, wholesome work, an ordered lifestyle — that can help to transform a drastic experience into everyday wisdom; or will the experience just sit there in contrast to the rest of life?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One thing is clear: anything that you can get externally is not awakening.</strong> If you can get something from a technology, it is something created and conditioned; but awakening is not created, and not conditioned; it is absolute and unborn and unconditional.</p>
<p>When psychedelics are used in traditional spiritual or religious settings, the "container" is very important. That is to say, in the proper ritual setting there should be a valid tradition (sometimes thousands of years old), a clear method, a wise and stable guide, a community that shares a good and correct intent, and a safe time and environment in which to proceed. <em>Don't take these for granted!</em> There are many old traditions that are either unclear from the start, or that have gone astray in recent times. There are many methods that are only "nice" or dramatic rather than clear and helpful. There are many confident leaders who in fact are not wise or compassionate. There are many communities that primarily share an implicit contract of mutual co-operation ("let's make our comfortable situation together") rather than sincerely seeking awakening.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you have to be clear about the aim and effect of your decisions. You have to take responsibility over how you influence yourself and your world; no outside power can do it for you.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Looking further into effect, one should know that there is a gain and loss to everything. There is something to be accepted and something to be let go of. With psychedelics, someone with a rigidly structured thinking may experience a loosening of that structure. "Rigidly structured thinking" could mean someone attached to being a Wall Street businessman or it could mean someone attached to being a hippy. It is the attachment to a certain perspective or ego character that is the issue. So one's structured thinking <em>may</em> be shaken, or it may not. But the next point is that the shaking has its benefits and its drawbacks.</p>
<p>With psychedelics, sometimes a person will get a glimpse into the boundless or timeless nature of reality. Often it may be a vague sense in among many other more raw and distracting experiences. And often the material that has built up in the unconscious — the wounds, the dreams, the desires, the stories — gets quickly vented, so that what one experiences is mostly the crud that has backed up over the course of one's life. This can be disturbing, <em>whether it is pleasant or unpleasant.</em> That is, you risk going through the hell of your own mind, but you also risk attaching to a false heaven. Your most intimate dreams can get released; and the dreams that you have suppressed or ignored are very likely to be prominent in that mix. So many drug trips feature spectacular emotions or visions that are <em>just the thing you would dream they would be</em>. Very easy to attach to. Very easy to take it for something real or important. Very easy to get sidetracked by it.</p>
<p>Further, the very process of shaking the mental structure is disturbing. In Buddhism, the effort is toward settling the mind so that it can be a clear mirror and reflect reality sharply and plainly. Mental structures get in the way of that clear mirror, but disturbance also gets in the way. The usual path is to settle the mind and let go of the structures gradually, through one's own effort. Then the whole experience gets well digested and becomes one's wisdom. Drastic swings are difficult to digest, and only become wisdom through much effort in the future, whether that effort is a consistent meditation practice or whether that effort is dealing with the life problems that arise from the disturbance.</p>
<p>It's like trying to eat a whole cow at one sitting. Usually digestion is done gradually, taking in amounts appropriate to the situation; then eventually the whole thing has been assimilated. I'm not saying it's not possible to "eat this whole cow" by getting a big drug-induced experience; I'm saying "how strong is your digestive power?" And are you prepared for the results of not being able to digest?</p>
<p>Experiences that come from outside sources may be like medicine. The medicine should be appropriate to the situation; and you only take it if you need it and there is no better way; and you only want to take it once. Once the medicine has been applied, one turns to lifestyle and one's own daily choices and efforts in order to build a healthy life.</p>
