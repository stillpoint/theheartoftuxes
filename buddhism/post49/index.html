  <h1>Prostrations?</h1>

<p>Yeah, many people have a resentful resistance to bowing. The pride that is being defended is itself a debasement. The bowing doesn't bring us down; the resistance to humility brings us down. Seeking to maintain a self-image, we shame ourselves.</p>
<p>There's also this common religious backlash against prostrations. "Don't bow to golden idols!" Don't worship false gods.</p>
<p>So it's up to <em>you</em> to clear out the false gods. This means clearing out your attachments and opinions — clearing out the mind that makes the world into a collection of objects (false idols). If you attach to an idea (say, of penitence), then you are worshiping a false idol. The fact that someone else gave you this idea is beside the point. <em>You</em> must put that idea down. Prostrations are the practice of putting it all down.</p>
<p>In life, you can never hold anything. Sometimes you have something and sometimes it is taken away; sometimes you win, sometimes you lose; sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. None of these situations is final. You keep moving. Within that movement, one pure non-thing continues endlessly. Prostrations are the practice of revealing that one pure non-thing behind all movement.</p>
<p>If you want to let go of the notion of guilt and penitence, then you have to do it yourself. You are the one who liberates you; no one else. So bowing down to the mat doesn't mean that you are less, or that you are unworthy, or that anything is above you. Bowing down to the mat means you come to your basis — the bottom line, the bare truth of who you are. And standing up doesn't mean you place yourself above anything else. Standing up means that you are originally worthy and noble and complete.</p>
<p>So if you want to let go of the ideas of guilt and penitence, then perhaps prostrations are the very best practice you can do. Touching your head to the mat, ungrasp these ideas and let them flow out into the earth. Standing up, stand up into your new life with a fresh start. Bowing down: let go. Standing up: arrive in your new life.</p>
<p>If you look openly, you will see that each part of a prostration expresses a profound meaning. Bringing hands together... kneeling... touching head to earth... opening hands... gathering... rising up straight... standing at rest.... All of these are very deep teachings. Any one of them could be an inexhaustible exploration.</p>
<p>The plain moment as-it-is = the mind free of defilements. It is not that there is some dirty sin that has to be cleaned. Originally you are clear, but attachment to thoughts and moods obscures that clarity. That is the defilement. Your true life is never defiled. Prostration practice reveals this truth through your very activity of bowing. Bowing down, breathing out: let it all go, let it all be. Standing up: this new life.</p>
<p>I am so often almost enraptured at the chance to let all of my burden of thought and agitation go at the bottom of a bow, and to stand up fresh and clean. To have 30 or 108 or 500 or 1,000 chances to do that is repeatedly wonderful.</p>
<p>Returning to prostrations daily also becomes like a long bow. You offer yourself to the form and you arise from it, so over the course of a month or year or many years you can experience what continues through it all. Offering, emerging, offering, emerging....</p>
<p>Once you get to a certain number of bows in a series (sometimes it's the very first one), your <em>will</em> kicks in. You have to apply your effort and energy in order to continue; you have to stand up for yourself. In this way, prostrations call your resources forth. Good, healthy will and devotion are built. And you get a lesson, established repeatedly in your bodymind, about the pure non-thing that continues through all of the ups and downs. The value of having that lesson grounded in your body and not merely in your thinking-understanding is immeasurable. One pure thing has been there through your entire life. You can actualize — make real and active — that one pure thing through your practice.</p>
<p>You don't need to feel good or bad about prostrations. Only do your practice without being affected by thoughts or moods. You understand this already, given your depth of interest in Zen Buddhism. Zen doesn't attach to mood or thought. Zen is only doing it.</p>
<p>So what "comes out in the wash" is that prostrations are just prostrations. The meaning of a prostration is that you are doing a prostration. Nothing more, nothing less. No concept added, no awareness taken away.</p>
<p>So if you ask me why do prostrations, the complete answer would be: [I get up and do prostrations.]</p>
<p>Very simple. "You can't understand it, you can only be it."</p>
<p>In this way, you can have your real life. But that is just an explanation. <em>Doing it</em> is the living truth.</p>
