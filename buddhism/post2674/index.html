  <h1>Can someone help me understand this aspect of Buddhism?</h1>

<p>I'm very glad if you find something of use in my writing.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If I can help you in anyway now or in the future, feel free to pm me.</em></p>
<p>You can help me by being clear.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>What Buddhist or Non Buddhist books/videos would you recommend?</em></p>
<p>Books are overrated. You have everything you need, you only need to do it. Most people depend on books too much, and delay their true work.</p>
<p>The motivation to collect quotes or build up piles of knowledge is the same grasping, wanting, seeking mind that I spoke of before. It is a suffering mind, because it assumes that you need something from outside â€” it assumes that you are not enough, and that this alive moment is not enough; but that is not so. Identify this suffering mind quickly when it appears, and you can soon be free of it: "Oh, this is wanting mind. It is saying that I am not enough, but it is wrong; I am enough."</p>
<p>I will give you some good instruction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a moment.</li>
<li>Put it all down.</li>
<li>Participate.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Find a moment.</strong>
Don't linger in the unreal past or future, and don't attach to an idea of the present. Trade your idea for the real thing.</p>
<p>The past has finished. The future has not happened. And the present has no duration in which it can exist. All of these "times" are just ideas. Where is real life? Find that.</p>
<p><strong>Put it all down.</strong>
Any time, any moment, open your hands and let it be. This doesn't have to be anything special; it doesn't have to make your patterns go away forever; it is just now letting things be. You put down your thinking, drop your concepts and opinions, let go of holding and making, let go of judging something good or bad. Just be in the middle of the moment, not moving toward anything or away from anything with your mind. In a moment, everything is allowed to be what it is. You don't touch it, you don't try to manipulate it.</p>
<p>When you practice putting it all down, everything in the world is allowed to move in its own correct and natural way. Rivers flow according to the land, lightning finds its own path of least resistance, and your life's innate intelligence finds its own pathway. It is the practice of utter trust.</p>
<p><strong>Participate.</strong>
When you put everything down, it's like re-setting the situation to zero. Your mind becomes clear: it can see and hear and smell and think clearly because it doesn't grasp at anything. Truth appears by itself.</p>
<p>But when truth appears by itself, you must then participate in it. Don't keep yourself separate. Once you see what is in front of you, respond and act in harmony with it. Follow the situation moment to moment. Dirty plate: clean it. Bedtime: go to sleep. Injustice: do the right thing. Nothing in particular: rest.</p>
<p>Get in the habit of throwing yourself into life. Practice trusting the moment and your movement in it, <em>before</em> you know what is going to happen. Then your trust and adaptability will grow and grow. Never mind about gain and loss, success and failure; those measurements are for people still in mind-prison; they are none of your business. Only try.</p>
<p>Some spiritual teachings end at the second point, putting it all down and returning to zero. This is a necessary step but it is not complete; it is not yet compassionate. You have to practice returning to zero so that your old patterns don't cover up your true life; but once you return to zero, you must then use that zero, that clarity, in order to help all beings. That is the inner meaning of Buddhism. Participate, act together with others whenever possible to break down your dead shell and find your vibrant, vulnerable, active heart.</p>
<p>The book to be read is the book of the moment. What do you read right now, in front of your face?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>That is clear and detailed instruction. You can investigate and experiment with that advice for the rest of your life. In books you may find other useful practices like sitting meditation, but if they are real they will all point in this same direction; they will all bring you to this same place: be in the moment, put it all down, and act in harmony with the situation.</p>
<p>In the old days, a person would walk for days or weeks or months to make contact with a teacher. He may have had to wait for more days, or upon reaching the destination may even have been turned away. But if he had the good fortune to sit face to face with a teacher, a single phrase or action may have been all that was transmitted. The seeker would then go back home and investigate that one phrase or action, questioning into it, trusting its action on his mind. One phrase or action to last maybe three or five years.</p>
<p>Deep teaching is like an inexhaustible well. You can keep going to it without ever using it up. Don't get distracted by the ten thousand other voices out there; don't think that there is some other secret to be found. Just find where your real life is. Find the center of it, the source of your own mind.</p>
