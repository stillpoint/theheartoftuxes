  <h1>Waiting for Maitreya. Should we find solace in the decline of Buddhism?</h1>

<p>Karmic merit' is a sort of simplistic way of speaking about controlling your karma and directing it toward awakening rather than continued suffering in Samsara (our usual, unsatisfactory, up-and-down situation life after life).</p>
<p>Karma means creation through intention and action. Whatever you intend in your thoughts or actually carry out in your action creates results. If you have clear and compassionate intentions and actions, you will get clear and beneficial results, results leading toward liberation from suffering. If you have unclear intentions and actions or selfish, negative, harmful ones, the results you reap in life will involve further confusion, pain, fear, including, reactivity, bad decisions, and likely further bad action.</p>
<p>So there is karma and the fruit of karma: cause and result. You plant a seed, and when conditions arise for that seed's ripening, you get the fruit, positive or negative.</p>
<p>If you want to take a step forward toward a better life and eventual awakening, you need the karmic basis to do it. If you've only done bad action, there is no karmic basis for good result. You have to do good action. So to take one step, you need a certain amount of karmic merit.</p>
<p>If you want to take bigger steps, you need more supporting conditions, more karmic merit. It's like when you go shopping: you can buy a piece of gum with pocket change, but if you want to buy a Ferrari you'd better have a large amount of money in your bank account.</p>
<p>Also, even if you have made a lot of money, if you've spent it on other things it won't be available to you for the Ferrari. In a similar way, you may have a fortunate situation right now because of karmic merit built up previously; but if you don't continue making good merit your bank account will dwindle, and if you do bad action or play out aggressive or indulgent scenarios in your mind your karmic bank account will go down.</p>
<p>We are taught that even just existing in our common deluded mindset is already negative, so without doing anything we are drawing on the bank account. So frequent beneficial activity is necessary.</p>
<p>This relationship between our actions and our spiritual potential is well recognized by masters who have successfully steered their karma toward enlightenment. In Vajrayana Buddhism, for example, there is a whole set of so-called 'preliminary' practices aimed at building karmic merit quickly. This provides the conditions for further high-level practice. Without the merit -- without the foundational conditions upon which progress depends -- attempts to do the practice will not bear any significant result.</p>
<p>Meritorious actions include making generous offerings, learning and sharing the Dharma, making and keeping practice vows and commitments, being compassionate to others, supporting and offering to enlightened beings, and making pilgrimages to sacred places. Keeping a clear, non-grasping mind moment to moment is strongly positive. And suffering for the sake of Dharma is also very positive (so keep that in mind when soreness appears in meditation, though you shouldn't persist to the point of self-harm).</p>
<p>Strengthening your connection to Dharma is very meritorious. Even gazing at and respecting images of enlightened beings helps to deepen your connection. Wishing people well on the path and rejoicing in their progress toward awakening also depends your connection.</p>
<p>Visiting a very sacred place like the site of Buddha's enlightenment or other holy places can inspire you and infuse you with positivity, so it's a very good activity from the standpoint of spiritual practice. At these places the sincere devotion and practice of millions of people has been focused, and can influence you at a very deep level (your mind stream can remember it and gravitate to it in future lives).</p>
<p>In regular situations, you are expected to purify your surroundings before performing ceremonies, for instance. And you have to do specific practice to gain merit. But at a few very sacred locations it is said that the power of the place itself is positive, and that you benefit by being there. You don't necessarily have to do the same kinds of purifications or construct the same kinds of ritual offerings because the place itself is so pure.</p>
<p>That is what I've been taught. I don't have vision into pure realms, so I can't verify this personally; but there are many beings alive who have this kind of perception.</p>
<p>But you should know that 'merit' is only a useful <em>concept</em>, pointing at how we should behave in order to get the results of awakening. If we're attach to the word and idea we can fall off the path.</p>
<p>There was a famous exchange between Bodhidharma, the first patriarch of Zen, and the Chinese emperor of his era. The emperor had learned about merit, and was hoping that he could get some recognition or confirmation for all the charitable things he'd been doing. But Bodhidharma said there's no merit, only emptiness. This hit the emperor's mind deeply! He wondered what his life was for, and why Bodhidharma was a 'holy' man if everything is empty. The emperor asked, "So who are you?" Bodhidharma replied: "Unknowing."</p>
<p>This is a yet higher level of teaching about merit. But you still need what we call karmic merit if you hope to understand this teaching and use it.</p>
