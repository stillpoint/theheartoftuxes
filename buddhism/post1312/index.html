  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This just demonstrates the problem with speculation versus experience: it's completely limited by one's limited view — one's ignorance of how things really are. What you see is your opinion and habitual way of seeing, not the actuality. People who have made peace with reality are very functional and happy. They can go anywhere, be with anyone, and do any job — no problem!</p>
<p>Currently, your wandering imagination is formed by your fears and habits. Since you have not traveled half-way to meet reality, you don't have access to reality, you don't experience it; you only experience your own idea.</p>
<p>If you ever actually experience coming closer to reality, or if you ever hang out with people who have considerable experience in practice, you will see for yourself that it engenders clarity, confidence, joy, contentment, ease, functionality, and many other positive qualities.</p>
<p>You're all wrapped up in your thinking without having any real experience. This is a direct example of how unreality bars you from being effective and keeps you in a suffering state.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I understand desire=suffering</em></p>
<p>You <em>don't</em> understand that desire equals suffering. First of all, <em>craving</em> causes (not equals) suffering. 'Desire' would be a mis-translation or misconception. As long as we are human, desire will move through us; it is not only a biological imperative, it is also a spiritual imperative. The persistence of desire is the eternal seeking itself through us. Desire is our movement toward awakening.</p>
<p>It is <em>attachment</em> to desire — or craving — that makes trouble for us. If we can be openhanded about desire, it provides the fuel for our good endeavors; but when we try to get and hold things for ourselves, we participate in the delusion of selfhood and strengthen its hold over us.</p>
<p>But you don't see the connection clearly; if you did, you wouldn't have doubt about these things. Speculating on your own is not the way to get clear. <em>Letting go</em> of speculation is necessary. <em>Letting go</em> of idea, and getting true experience, is necessary. So you need correct teaching and correct practice. If you only rely on your own view, your current limitations will continue. Currently your view is conditioned by fear; so fear is what arises in your speculation. You need proper teaching and practice to go beyond your limiting mental factors.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If my desires cease, so does my slavery to wage-labor</em></p>
<p>This is more speculation, and very faulty logic. It is a view again based on your made-up idea and shaped by fear.</p>
<p>First; <em>you do not know</em> what will happen if your desires cease. You only have your one-track, imagined idea about it.</p>
<p>Second; we are not talking about ceasing desire. We are talking about being okay with reality.</p>
<p>Third; you seem to think that society revolves around slavery based on desires. You can't conceive of society based on other motives, like compassion, joy in creativity, mutual support, and so on.</p>
<p>Fourth; why would you idealize slavery? Are you so trapped by fear that you cannot appreciate free movement over slavery?</p>
<p>Fifth; if you weren't enslaved to wage-labor, would you not still be able to engage in it? Would you not be able to choose wise activities, and choose them <em>based</em> on wisdom rather than enslavement?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Viewing things in the abstract is beautifully hopeful</em></p>
<p>You have not demonstrated that. You have demonstrated that your imagination kidnaps your mind, keeps you limited, and makes you fearful.</p>
<p>But that is not the original, right function of imagination. It happens because you are not clear; you don't have your feet on the ground. If you were able to stay grounded in reality, then you could use your imagination properly, <em>knowing it as imagination</em>, rather than thinking of it as a reality.</p>
<p>Hope is only hopeful if it can be real. How can you make positive visions real? Only by having a relationship with reality. Otherwise, the 'hope' is mere delusion; and deluded people do not find their way through life very well.</p>
<p>Finding your way to fulfill positive motives and visions depends on working with cause and effect. You need to see very clearly how things work, and what brings about positive aims. If you can't see cause and effect, you have no control in life, and you are truly enslaved, at the whim of circumstance and unable to do anything but retreat to your fantasy realm. You theorize that fantasy will keep you happy; but in truth that is not the case. The further you retreat into fantasy, the more tenuous is your relationship with life... and the more tenuous is your relationship with *yourself. You become less capable, more fearful, you retreat and isolate yourself more, and it all leads to suffering. Who has ever been successful by blinding themselves to how things actually work?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I worry that the reality restricts you to monastery life</em></p>
<p>OMG, too much fantasizing! Why would reality restrict you to monastery life? Monastery reality is monastery life. Householder reality is householder life. Solo traveler reality is solo traveler life. Businessman reality is businessman life. City reality. Country reality. American reality. Asian reality. Land reality. Sea reality. Sky reality.</p>
<p>Reality means everything — things as they are. Only <em>you</em> make limitations, with your thinking-imagining. Only <em>you</em> make "restriction to monastery life".</p>
<p>Next; <em>if you were</em> restricted to monastery life, it might go much better for you; because then you could practice letting go of your wrong ideas and becoming friends with the world-as-it-is.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Your thinking is a crazy drunk driver, taking you on a bad trip. If you let this driver control your life you will have disastrous accidents.</p>
<p>Your clear mind must take the wheel, and put thinking in the back seat. Clear mind must be the driver of your life.</p>
<p>When you learn to be grounded in reality, then your thinking can function correctly. You will know that it is just thinking, not reality; and you will be able to use it for work, play, relationship, creativity, problem solving, and so on. But if you are not grounded in reality, then your drunk-driver thinking will control your life and bring you to ruin.</p>
