  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There are many different ways of practicing with mantras, not only one way. Some confusion can appear if you assume that different sources are talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>The practice you should do depends on your aim and the tradition in which you are practicing. It is best to find a good teacher and engage in one course of practice with them. Then you will get the teaching you require, at the time you require it.</p>
<p>Few things are worse than premature knowledge. Knowing something before your not-knowing has had a chance to work on you can sabotage the entire arc of learning. So things are taught in their right order and relationship to each other.</p>
<p>In Vajrayana style, which is sometimes considered quite complex, mantra represents the voice aspect of Buddha or enlightenment, and its practice unfolds what is called the Sambhogakaya. You don't need to know this at the beginning; what's of significance is that body, speech, and mind all have representative aspects of enlightenment, and each aspect is trained. So in Vajrayana practices, there is almost always an action (body), a mantra or recitation (speech), and a visualization (mind); and they are all done at the same time.</p>
<p>In other traditions, there may not be the same kind of granularity within the practice. Zen style, for instance, is 'just do it' style. Only completely recite; or if chanting, only completely chant, with your whole being. The aim is to express yourself completely in the moment. Complete expression is complete moment mind; it goes beyond the small, illusory self. This way is very simple.</p>
<p>There are also mantra practices for healing specific mind sicknesses (and sometimes also body sickness). Mantras are the sound-energy expressions of particular qualities. Often they convey the essence of a great enlightening being; or they may sometimes just have their own quality or power.</p>
<p>For example, consider the impact of yelling "HEY!" to someone across the street. And compare that to the impact of softly cooing to a partner "My dear, I love you very much." The words and the way they are delivered have a particular energy and function. Even before the language meaning, they convey a clear message and impart it deeply into one's being. You could hear similar things being said in a different language, and you'd still get some of the energy of it, you'd still understand something at a gut level. Think of the energy conveyed by "Ahhhhhhhh...." or "Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>Mantras are like this, but with a more seminal substance to them. The sounds themselves are very direct vehicles of enlightening energy in its many different forms. The function of some sound combinations is very broad, while the function of others is quite particular. There are mantras for connecting with various deities and their vows and activities. There are mantras for developing compassion, for cleaning the environment, for repentance and purification, for quickly resolving karma, and for receiving and sharing solace.</p>
<p>But at a very basic level, mantra can simply be an object of concentration, like many other possible objects such as breath or color or physical sensation. In formal sitting, one can recite the mantra and let it be clear in the awareness from moment to moment. When distracted, just return quickly and easily to the recitation. Thus mantra becomes the focus, and excursions and disruptions gradually settle down.</p>
<p>Outside of formal sitting, mantra can be used as a foundation of mindfulness — presence. The mantra is held constantly in the background as you go about your day. It keeps you engaged and aware in the present moment. In this style of practice, it is not necessary to perceive the mantra to the exclusion of other experiences. It just sort of anchors you, keeps your mind from drifting far.</p>
<p>This type of practice gives mantra its name: "mind protection". Since you have a constant anchor, the mind is protected from all kinds of harm. Mental-emotional harm comes to you through thought; so when you constantly let go of the thoughts that threaten to grab and take control of you, you are constantly protected. The mantra helps you constantly let go because it provides something very definite to return to. It also builds your will and your Dharma energy through repetition.</p>
<p>Because this style of practice is so simple (though it requires ongoing effort) it is often prescribed as a cure or literal protection in cases of crisis or turmoil.</p>
<p>Yet another style of practice with mantra starts with concentration — bringing the mind to one-pointedness with the mantra (in which the mantra is perceived very clearly, without distraction) — and then gently turns the mind back to itself, back to the one doing the recitation. The combination of concentration and self-inquiry can be a powerful practice for awakening to the true nature of self.</p>
<p>Mantra can be performed aloud, under the breath, or silently within the mind. When you are more agitated and sitting quietly is difficult, you can use your voice to help you.</p>
<p>Mantra also has the wonderful benefit of adaptability to your emotional state and level of energy. When sad, you can do sad mantra. When angry, you can do angry mantra. When very energetic, you can recite quickly and brightly. When very calm, you can recite very slowly and quietly. (Or vice versa, to apply calming energy when agitated and envigorating energy when dull.) In this way, mantra can merge with your life — as it is. When you, your situation, and the mantra all come together, you attain universal mind and can wake up out of your dream of self.</p>
<p>If you want to practice a mantra, you can choose one of the very common ones practiced by millions of other practitioners. There are many mantras that require instruction and initiation from a guru (this is especially true in the Vajrayana tradition); but there are also many that are open for practice by anyone at any time.</p>
<p>Two very popular and wonderful mantras are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>mani</em> (jewel) mantra: <strong>Om Mani Padme Hum</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repetition of the name of the Bodhisattva of Compassion: <strong>Kwan Se Um Bosal</strong> (Korean) or <strong>Kwan Shi Yin Pusa</strong> (Chinese)</p>
</li>
</ul>
