  <h1>I'm so tired of being cynical</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>How is this a product of my own desires?</em> </p>
<p>The term 'poor boundaries' is a catch-all phrase for dysfunctional relationship where you invite or allow others where they don't belong. It leaves you open to intrusion, invasion, manipulation, being taken advantage of, being fooled, and so on. So you don't set the boundary; you don't maintain proper responsibility for your privacy and integrity.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Because of your own desire or ignorance. These are two of the <em>Three Poisons</em> in Buddhist teaching â€” the three types of mind that create suffering. The third is aggression, which usually can not only hold a boundary but will also intrude on others'.</p>
<p>When you want something from another person it opens you to manipulation. So whether it's companionship, physical intimacy, fame, recognition, or the opportunity to play out a certain role or ego character, your <em>wanting</em> is what causes you to compromise your integrity, allowing others to step over proper boundaries of relationship.</p>
<p>If you only have love in your heart, you will wish the best for others but not need anything from them. Then it is very difficult to manipulate you. You hold the boundary simply because it represents integrity: it is correct for you, and for others.</p>
<p>Ignorance also leaves you open. This means being clueless and unaware about what's going on. It is another compromise you make with yourself, to give up responsibility for yourself. It is buying into laziness and dullness.</p>
<p>There is also the question of what attracted mean-spirited people to you, and what made them think that it would be a good idea to take advantage of you. Their lack of self-respect connected with something in your situation. This is karma. Because of the way you have used your mind and action in the past, you carry around certain patterns and qualities in the present and future. Because you have taken advantage of others in the past (and perhaps in past lives), others now may be drawn to take advantage of you.</p>
<p>You can turn this around. As you already realize, just meditating is not enough. People somehow brand meditation as a cure-all for life; but it is not. Meditation has a specific function. But in order to change your karma, you have to regulate your thinking and behavior in all the rest of your life. It does no good to have a half-hour of relative clarity if during the rest of your day you indulge in the Three Poisons.</p>
<p>So first you need to learn what correct intention and behavior mean. If you didn't get this from your parents, it's a long haul. Expect it to take time. Although you may experience many ups and downs, if you keep at it the general trend will be up, toward happiness. You can learn about correct intention and action through Buddhist teaching.</p>
<p>Next, you have to apply it. Having learned what it's about, you can try it and then soon decide whether you are going to commit to correct intention and action as a way of life. Only doing good action part of the time still makes seeds of future suffering (like poor boundaries and betrayal, or worse).</p>
<p>Sometimes losing a person or group, or even a whole community of people is a great blessing in disguise. At first you may take it very personally and feel it as a reflection on your value. It is not; it is a reflection of how others receive your behavior (or don't receive it). But it may give you the freedom to move beyond and above harmful ties and messy relationships. If the people who don't respect you no longer have much significance in your life, that can be wonderful. Then you can start from scratch, building your own self-respect based on correct intention and action.</p>
<p>So what is the basis of self-respect? Wisdom and compassion. Wisdom means knowing in your direct experience what life is about: understanding impermanence, understanding what is valuable and what is not, understanding the difficulty all humans and all living beings share. This understanding is not just from words and thoughts, but from experience in life situations. So that points to ongoing study and training that you apply to your life.</p>
<p>The second basis of self-respect is compassion. This means developing a heart that truly cares for others, and a life that carries out this care in action after action. If you start asking how you can make others' lives more clear and happy, you yourself will become more clear and happy. And vice versa: if you focus only on what you want, you will not have the basis for happiness and self-respect.</p>
