  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It all depends on the mind, of course.</p>
<p>Whether one's art is true practice, true Dharma, depends on how one keeps the mind. Which one is taking the lead at any given moment, the art or career, or Dharma?</p>
<p>Essentially, music or any creative art is the same as practice. But does it have a deep, clear, Dharmic direction; not just in your talk but in your heart and activity?</p>
<p>In practical terms, being on your own, guided only by your own preferences and patterns, and influenced by others who may have less understanding of Dharma and less respect for it, it can be very easy to stray off the path. So it's a matter of direction: Do you know your direction, and can you keep it?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Love, and do what you will.</em></p>
<p>(Saint Augustine)</p>
<p>If you 'have your center' -- that is, if your direction is clear and unmoved by the worldly winds of praise, fame, gain, pleasure, blame, disrepute, loss, and pain -- then the creative process is your Bodhisattva activity.</p>
<p>You don't have to do things the way others do them. Great artists, like masters of any path, make their own way. Humility, dedication to the craft, study, nuts-and-bolts work (like professional development, marketing, etc.), practice, trying and failing, enjoying, sharing encouragement, making space for something beyond the self, uplifting and awakening others, harmonizing, and losing yourself in music are all the path. Not only what we think of as the artistic/creative part. It is <em>all</em> creative, if you have your center in the moment. You play life; you don't just play an instrument.</p>
<p>Besides training in Dharma I've also done writing, brushwork and visual art, performance art, music, photography, and dance, all at a professional level. In my experience, the paths all have the same essential quality as Zen interview: you come face to face with vastness; you let go of what you used to know and who you used to be; and you entrust yourself to the Source from which all wisdom and creativity arises.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Put it all down; truth appears by itself.</em></p>
<p>(Zen Master Seung Sahn)</p>
<p>That's just my take on art. There are many approaches. One of my pet peeves is that so many artists, especially young artists, are so conceptual. They seem to trust ideas far more than they trust their Unknowing. They think they are responsible for making something great, and it becomes a process of self-aggrandizement rather than creativity. Perhaps this is a side effect of training that emphasizes skill over heart. While an artist's eye or ear is being developed, they are not taught how to provide space for that which is <em>greater</em> than them, greater than their small self. It is left to chance and intuition.</p>
<p>I've been fortunate to have teachers who had the right order of things: First understand the correct motivation, then trust what moves through you, then train the skill. (I mean in terms of priority, not necessarily in terms of <em>when</em> things happen in the course of training.) Skill and ideas should not be in the lead. I encourage you to give yourself space to listen, and space to allow yet-unknown movement, and even just space for the sake of space itself. This is far more powerful than just coming up with ideas or nice but arbitrary sounds. If you get the order of things right, then your ideas have a guiding principle, and you can use them skillfully.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to allow space to do the creating. It takes a level of maturity, of self-trust, to let go of making and let something greater move through. The feminine side -- surrender -- is vital.</p>
<p>It is also important to know when to stop. How many masterpieces have been ruined by overworking? One too many notes; or a hundred....</p>
<p>Direction -- clear motivation --  is the foundation. <em>Why</em> do it? We see a lot of lip service paid to spirituality. Spiritual-sounding words and spiritual-looking costumes and paraphernalia are collected, but the day-to-day action doesn't really reflect spirituality. The creative process must include everything and everyone. It is not just for you, not just for the artist.</p>
<p>So the way you interact with your collaborators and business partners must be transformed. The way you treat your family must be transformed. The way you relate to your audience must be transformed. Is the motive pure? Isn't it wonderful to make a true <em>offering</em>, openhanded and generous? To do your very best and to shine from the depths, without requiring recognition or approval? This is very wonderful. It is sacred.</p>
<p>So I think many great musicians are like shamans: they make the strenuous journey into their own depths, for the sake of others. In the process, everyone gets liberated.</p>
<p>And this brings up another important point: If you are to go into the depths, it's necessary to be able to return. Many artists are good at going but not good at returning. So we see a lot of burnout, ill mental health, and even suicide among artists. Coming back is a practice. The better you train in simplicity, groundedness, non-pretentious attitude, plain momentary reality, the deeper you will be able to go for the sake of others.</p>
<p>Good luck on the path.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>See the recent short article about David Bowie consulting with master Chogyam Trungpa regarding his life direction. Bowie says that he was "about a month away" from becoming a Buddhist monk, but still torn between that and pursuing a career in music. Trungpa told him that he would do more good in the world by creating music.</p>
<p>That's not a set rule; it <em>happened</em> to be true for Bowie. Trungpa could see people's karma. In your case, it could turn out that your glory and benefit would unfold through aerospace engineering, or fathering a family, or skateboard design. Karma -- how your particular life manifests -- becomes Dharma when you have your clear direction: what is your life for? When direction is clear, you then offer space for things to unfold as they will. This is the very same creative process.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It's not necessary to have a Buddhist-sounding band name or Buddhist-sounding lyrics. What's necessary is to make your inner direction clear, and then to act with wholeheartedness and sincerity. Don't put on an act. Just, whatever you do, only <em>do</em> it. Do it completely. A cheesy love song performed with the whole heart is more spiritual than a bunch of pseudo-spiritual ideas rammed down the audience's throat. Trust that spirituality is <em>already</em> within every aspect of life. No need to drum it up.</p>
