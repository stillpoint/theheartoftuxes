  <h1>One of my favorite parts of my practice is maintaining my humble little altar. It's a mirror of myself, and seeing that I just got a mandala to deck it out a little more, I felt like sharing it with all of you. Post pictures of your own altars if you feel up to it, I love seeing other peoples'!</h1>

<p>Many functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To maintain a centering, spiritual presence among the other formations in your life. Everything you touch has not only physical but psychological and energetic impact: dinner plates represent nourishment, bed represents rest, desk represents work.... So having a physical and symbolic representation of your practice helps to balance your life. The mundane objects aren't the last word. Psychologically, the importance and respect you place on practice has its voice among all the other forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the altar itself is given prominence, placed in a central position or a place of focus or honor, kept well, furnished with items that are of high quality or meaningful provenance, your connection to what it represents is all the more augmented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The items on an altar are highly symbolic, and speak to the archetypal level of your mind, a level that is deeper than your separate individual being, and where you connect to shared and universal truths. Participating in these symbols further connects your mind to their meaning, informing and conditioning your deeper mind. This plants seeds that later ripen into aspiration and faith, attainment, stability in practice, and ongoing connection with the Dharma (even beyond death, through future lives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the altar you experience Dharma in many dimensions. The tendency in the West is to engage with Dharma almost solely through concepts — through reading and discussing and trying to understand — but this is a very weak approach that often fails to significantly transform people's lives. In fact, we can get very stuck in concept and unable to move on beyond to real wisdom. So the opportunity to experience multiple dimensions of Dharma is very precious: devotion can arise, informing not merely the head but also the heart; faith can be engendered and supported; the good qualities of the Buddha (or whatever representative of enlightenment is featured on the altar) such as balance, nobility, virtue, equanimity, compassion, concentration, and so on, can be witnessed repeatedly, contemplated in relaxed and peaceful moments, and absorbed into one's own being. Light of a candle can be seen directly, and the meaning of 'lighting your own light' and 'lighting the way for all others' can be experienced on a primal, physical level. The radiance of warmth can be experienced. The uplifting fragrance of incense, like the wafting of our vows and virtue among all beings, can be enjoyed. (The sense of smell in particular reaches very directly to mental layers of memory, establishing Dharma in us deeply.) The freshness of water offerings, like the freshness of our uncontrived, momentary mind, can be given to the process of awakening. And so on, all the senses and levels of self engaged in positive activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approaching the altar respectfully and bowing to it and to the Buddha reminds us of our correct relationship with life: when we surrender to our original mind, we are uplifted. (And on the contrary, our common, habitual effort to put ourselves first ahead of other beings debases us and keeps us enslaved to ego.) Even one instance of offering a thought of respect toward the Buddha is tremendously auspicious, generating the causes for future awakening. How much more so to make that moment of respect overt, conscious... to participate physically and emotionally and with focus... to bring your entire being to it. Aside from the merit gained that later blossoms auspiciously, a moment of complete activity like this is already Buddhic activity, already awakened life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeating the ritual forms connected with practice develops a power of its own, like rivulets of water forming broader and deeper channels as they run, creating powerful, unstoppable torrents. For instance, if you have associated sincerity, humility, devotion, and mindfulness with your altar for a few simple moments every day, in times of crisis your association with the altar will help you return to those qualities — even if you would otherwise be incapable of doing so. Even in times when meditation becomes difficult, the ritual itself carries you along. The movements of body and mind then naturally gravitate toward Dharma, and eventually may even have the power to overcome your negative habits like laziness: the sight of the altar will inspire the will to practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treating the altar objects with care and respect, cleaning them and handling them both gently and confidently, without hesitation, trains us in correct relationship with worldly things. Worldly things are worldly only because of our minds. Because we think of something as ordinary, as '<em>just</em> that', it then becomes ordinary. Our own ignoring makes a mundane world. But when attention and care are brought to the moment and objects facing us, we transform them into the pure land. The altar, then, becomes our gateway to the pure land, the place where we practice purity and correct relationship. It trains us in mindfulness and directness. Lighting a candle without being fancy, ringing a bell in just the right spot, filling a water bowl generously without hemming and hawing — all of these actions train us in how to live well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the altar, traditionally, all the elements are represented. The altar platform, rice, salt, and/or rice or ashes in the incense bowl represent Earth. Candles represent Fire. A water bowl or multiple bowls represent Water. Incense represents Air. The Buddha image, in some cases a mirror or other objects, and the space around the altar represent Space. (In some teachings the various objects are said to represent different things; like, salt can represent purification.) Each of these things in turn points to the relationship of manifest things and to the makeup of ourselves: Earth items demonstrate supporting and nourishing energies; Fire items demonstrate luminous, radiant, and penetrating energies; Water items demonstrate fluid and reflective energies; Air items demonstrate transformative and dissipating energies; Space items demonstrate the unifying substrate of emptiness and stillness. Our physical body, our warm activity, our cool fluidity, our breath and subtle energy, and our mind are further reflected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, all phenomena and qualities of the manifest and unmanifest universe are represented in the altar. Faced with this, we can experience both awe and comfort: having the universe in front of us is mind-blowing, but also we can feel very much at home because nothing is missing. It reflects our own original completion back to us, and our nature as both the interpenetration of all things and the empty clarity behind all things. So approaching the altar can help take our minds away and quickly bring us to a very clear meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond these functions, the altar can figure prominently in many different kinds of practices. For example, the statues, <em>stupas</em> (pagoda-like structures), and paintings in Vajrayana and some other traditions are not merely decoration but are used very intimately as supports for practices that involve visualization. In many Zen traditions, the instruments that lead chanting and the 'incense boards' that cut off mind with a hit are kept on the altar. Contrary to popular belief that sees Zen as dry and sparse, altar practice is so highly regarded in some Zen traditions that the senior student in charge of leading practice is given the duty of preparing the altar at the start of each session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the hang-ups people have about altars comes from their previous religious or materialist conditioning. Either they have heard in their religion that false idols are evil and mustn't be worshiped, or they have been told (and chastized) that the spiritual dimension is new-age quackery and that only material things are real. These are both exceedingly immature understandings of the true meaning of an altar. Yes, of course, one should not worship false idols. So don't make it false! Don't make the mistake of thinking that Buddha is in the statue; just as you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that you are your body. Your mind is Buddha; it is your job to reveal that, and to free yourself of attachment to 'false idols' — attachment to names and forms. And to write off the spiritual dimension is to deprive yourself of not only the psychological benefit of healing the personal mind, but the enlightened benefit of realizing universal mind.</p>
<p>The functions of an altar can be spoken of almost endlessly. But it is in engaging with the altar that the real understanding emerges. Thinking isn't understanding. <em>Doing</em> is understanding. When you pour water, you attain understanding of the essence of water. When you light incense and smell its fragrance, the truth of it is completely beyond words. This is high-level practice.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>At any time, what you see, what you hear, and what you smell all becomes part of your consciousness. So when you see the candles, smell the incense, see the Buddha, and listen to the chanting, it all creates good feeling in your consciousness. When you come to the dharma room, your outside condition and situation disappears and a good feeling appears. Your small mind disappears and for a little while you have Buddha mind. That’s how we use the items on the altar and in the dharma room.</em></p>
<p>&gt;– Zen Master Seung Sahn</p>
