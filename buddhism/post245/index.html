  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>For the sincere practitioner, there is never a conflict. That is because the practice is within your mind — it is for your mind to be free and flexible and equanimous and stable and harmonious with any situation. <strong>Freedom doesn't mean you get your favorite situation and everything goes well for you. Freedom means you can be in any situation, with anyone, and you don't lose your presence and compassion.</strong></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/37xesu/is_homelessness_a_poor_choice/">previous post</a> on spiritual homelessness, in its entirety:</p>
<p>If you are a saint, having attained enlightenment through tremendous effort and consistent discipline, then yes you might choose homelessness. But the homeless fantasy tends to be an escape for others, an avoidance of doing what has to be done to come to terms with life.</p>
<p>The reason most 18-year-olds might think of homelessness as an option is really their fear of change: they fear that the habits and opinions they hold dear will have to be given up. They can only see themselves in one way, one self-image, not having gained the ability and confidence to take on new roles. While the fantasy might involve some spiritual ideal, the reality is that their motivation doesn't involve actually giving themselves over — surrendering. Instead the motivation has to do with avoiding circumstances that challenge their preferences.</p>
<p>This teenage-to-twenties age is a chaotic phase where the self-image is not clear. The child has started to let go of the parents (but many people don't let go of the parents until much later), but has not yet formed their own self-supporting life. The benefit of the chaotic phase is that much experimentation is possible. So a young person may try on a different style every year, or every season. They may try different ways of presenting themselves to others, they may try different clothing, different circles of friends. So the possibilities are just starting to be explored. But what happens is that each new persona is adopted with such grasping, such certainty. It is the mask of certainty, because behind it is utter vulnerability: the young person has not yet had a lot of experience in making their way in the world, so there is tremendous doubt, which they cover up with airs of cool bravado or obsessive identification with a certain group or ideology. (Thus this is the ideal age group for forming soldiers and ideological zealots.)</p>
<p>If we are being honest about it, most young people have a right to be terrified, as they are going off on their own into some pretty overwhelming and shitty situations. And this fear can harden into strategies of avoidance, whether they are conscious or unconscious strategies. Kids may linger at home under their parents' protection (though they also long to get away); they may tune out through video games or sex or drugs or risky behavior; they may wander aimlessly or create sort of hippy fantasies. These are all ways of avoiding the thing that is felt under the skin — the terror at facing the future.</p>
<p>The future is not faced all at once. It is faced by going forward into the present moment, into the next new thing. Just as a sapling grows into a mighty tree by always reaching into the unknown, a human grows into greatness just by not avoiding this next new thing. Always taking the next single step is the way you eventually find yourself having traveled thousands of miles and having become an expert traveler.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, homelessness is not freedom. There is a lot of suffering involved, not the least of which is what you start to think of yourself. Your self-view becomes more limited, perhaps even shame-ridden; and the circumstances of your life, without money to ensure good conditions that promote healthy body and mind, become very difficult to overcome. If you are working, you can at least at some point leave your job and look for other work; but if you are not working it may be very, very difficult to do anything to improve your situation once you decide it needs changing. No money, sometimes no food or good clothing, no work experience, no experience in living with others, no good connections... your mind and your body could both become very stuck.</p>
<p>People have this notion that getting rid of their things will rid them of their attachments. While it's certainly true that having a clean and open living environment can help your mind and heart to stay clear, the source of attachment <em>is in the mind</em>. Just getting rid of the money and possessions will not dislodge attachment to money, to things, to preferences, to opinions. Getting rid of attachment requires correct and consistent practice of letting-go. In many cases, this means that work and relationship will provide a better training than isolating yourself. When you are alone, you automatically follow your own idea and your own preference. Your waking moments are spent deepening the pursuit of "I want...", and your sleeping moments may be spent dreaming of what you don't have. This is not freedom; it only deepens your attachment. And if your outside situation is unpredictable, dangerous, unclean, and frequently uncomfortable, your mind will turn more and more to "I want...." This is not the kind of training you need; it is training in slavery. Living and working with others trains you in letting go of opinion, finding ways to work to mutual benefit, and calling on your own resources to find solutions.</p>
<p>An enlightened being may be able to do homelessness, because they have already banished the "I want..." kind of thinking. Their choice is not for themselves, but for others. This is not at all the motivation that most people have in imagining a free and easy lifestyle that abandons work.</p>
<p>If you want to test your freedom, work hard at something out of your comfort zone. If you want to test your ability to let go of possessions, keep a home but don't buy frivolous things.</p>
<p>And if you <em>really</em> want to do the homeless, possessionless life correctly, then become a monk. Completely give up your expectation of anything for yourself, and devote your life 100% to the benefit of others. That means getting training in correct conduct and freedom of mind, and living in monastic training settings that require you to put down your own opinion (so that you can reveal your original mind, which doesn't depend on opinion and preference). And it means making total effort every day, working to the betterment of yourself and others.</p>
<p>The Japanese term for a Zen monk in training is <em>Unsui</em>, which means 'cloud water'. The heart and mind of a true monk are free of attachment, so he is like water that can completely dissipate and then take any form. There is nothing that you can hold onto to manipulate him; it would be like trying to grab a cloud. This is the true homelessness, the mind that doesn't cling to or avoid anything. The monk is free to drift like a cloud, not because outer circumstances have been arranged to his liking, but because his devotion to the path is completely independent of circumstances: because <em>the mind</em> is free, the outside situation is no problem.</p>
