  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>What do you imagine that to mean? Do you think someone just randomly erupts with awakening, without gathering the conditions for it?</p>
<p>Even if we set aside the <em>false</em> claims of enlightenment that are far more prevalent, self-declaration still follows profound teaching and training. It's not that these self-declared never had a master or never engaged in a course of training.</p>
<p>Far from it: if you look into their biographies you will see that they committed strongly to training, far more than the common person. Many were monks, for heaven's sake! That's a serious commitment to training. It's just that at some point their path diverged. Either they eventually found something lacking in their current training, or their creative principle birthed a new approach. But that was all built on the foundation of training.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you follow their biographies forward you will see that most self-declared masters themselves took students, out of compassion and the zeal to pass on their own best, most complete teaching. If they did not recognize the importance of the master-student transmission and the causal necessity of training, why would they take students?</p>
<p>Those who think of Buddha only as a self-awakened being, for instance, miss both the fortunate teachings he received and the <em>intense</em> process he undertook to fulfill them. He took the teachings as far as they would go, and only then did he continue based on his new awareness. These same people must also recognize that <em>eons</em> of exceptional study and training came before the Buddha's final enlightenment. During the lifetime in which he achieved enlightenment he studied with, most notably, the teachers Alama Kalama and Uddakka; and in countless previous lifetimes he studied with many teachers and received transmissions from previous Buddhas (including training as a disciple of Dipankara Buddha -- he had the extreme fortune to study closely with a Buddha!!).</p>
<p>Even if we pass over all of this, we just have to look dispassionately at what is in front of our eyes: of the enlightened masters in the world, and of the many more <em>vidyadharas</em> (those awakened to self-nature but not yet fully enlightened), who of them have achieved it without a teacher or course of training?</p>
<p>And between those who reject masters and teaching situations, doing it 'on their own', and those who devote themselves to study with a clear-eyed master, which of them show progress, which of them actually become transformed? For those with actual, significant experience among people who practice the difference is very clear. Only wishful thinking tends to differ.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why someone might <em>reasonable</em> forego training with a particular master; but it should be seen as a temporary measure until the right training conditions can be found. Depending on one's capacity, lifestyle, and motivation, the amount of contact one has with a teacher will also vary. Remember that this is a process that happens over innumerable lifetimes.</p>
<p>For example, the Buddha taught that we should try to associate with those who are better than us -- wiser and more noble-minded -- and that we should not linger with those who are less pure or less accomplished. But the Buddha still had thousands of students and disciples! He didn't mean that we should go the whole way alone. Monks who had internalized certain methods and teachings would retreat for a while to practice them; but then they'd return to get clarification, have their attainment checked, and receive further teaching.</p>
<p>The most common reason people avoid teaching situations is ego: basically, they don't want to be called on their bullshit. A sincere student <em>wants</em> to be called on her/his bullshit! They <em>want</em> to make use of anything that will help them wake up. But it takes a degree of maturity to distinguish between what's nourishing to the soul (integrity) and what feeds ego.</p>
<p>That's why Zen Master Dogen said that good practice feels like something is being imposed upon you. If it didn't feel like that, it wouldn't be impacting the entrenched sense of self -- the deeply cherished preferences, habits, and opinions. If it's always easy or always your favorite way, it's not bringing your attachments to light.</p>
<p>Tadpoles depend on the pond for life. Without the water, they die. <em>After</em> their metamorphosis, as frogs they can move between water and land, independent. Likewise, we depend on correct learning conditions until we reach a certain point of transcendence, after which we are free to come and go on our own. But even then, a true master continues cultivating. The masters I've known continued practicing after their enlightenment.</p>
