  <h1>First meditation and I feel nauseous. Normal?</h1>

<p>There are many possible causes for the feelings of nausea and dizziness in meditation. Rest assured that it is quite common for people to feel one or the other, or both.</p>
<p>The causes may be <strong>physical or physiological</strong>, for example from not being used to the sitting posture, or from having too much food in your stomach. Depending on the usual state of circulation in your body, when you sit that circulation may change; and if your body has not yet adjusted to the sitting posture the circulation may also not yet be regulated. People with blood pressure issues (low or high) may need some more guidance and practice with both posture and breathing before they normalize.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>if you are tired</strong> when you sit, that tiredness may manifest as dizziness or even mini-blackouts.</p>
<p>Some meditation training styles advise taking a few moments to <strong>get the circulation flowing</strong> again before standing up, and to take care in standing. After a sitting, gently unfold the legs, rub the palms together and cup the eyes for a while, then the ears (this is pleasant), then tap the skull with the fingertips, tap the concavity where the nape of the neck joins the skull ("beating the heavenly drum", it's called in <em>Qigong</em>), and even massage the shoulders, arms, and legs if you like. This helps to re-establish a good circulation of blood and energy, and helps prevent problems with stagnant energy lodging in the head or body.</p>
<p>A <strong>greater overall fitness</strong> tends to help with comfort in sitting. Yoga or Taiji or other physical/energetic practices tend to combine very well with meditation.</p>
<p>The causes may also be <strong>emotional or psychological</strong>. When we sit, if our relationship with our mind and the method is correct then many things will tend to manifest from the background. The right relationship in meditation is letting-be, not <em>making</em> something happen. When we settle into letting-be, then previously suppressed or unvoiced patterns all of a sudden have the space to emerge. This is healthy! It's just that as we experience these things emerging and moving out it may be uncomfortable or strange. <strong>It is important to stay open-handed</strong> in our attitude, so that everything can find its own balance, everything can move to its own right place by itself. (Even issues with physical origins tend to crop up or become more obvious because of the space provided in meditation. This, too, is healing.)</p>
<p>The opposite of this correct attitude can also produce nausea or dizziness. <strong>Many people wrongly conceive of meditation as a fight for control of the mind.</strong> In the quest for concentration or for certain other mind states, the meditator will put pressures on the mind and body. The things that would normally bubble up and move through on their own then build up, like the pressure building in a pot on the stove. The more the meditator uses concentration to control his experience, the more pressure builds up. This can produce all kinds of strange experiences, from physical manifestations, to visions, to woozy or swimming feelings, to emotional upheaval.</p>
<p><strong>Breathing</strong> is so interrelated with both the physical and mental aspects of our lives that it forms a special sub-category of its own, worthy of our attention. It can take some time and practice to find a good, balanced breathing pattern in meditation. Trying to control the mind and trying to control the breathing tend to go hand-in-hand. Some teachers will even use the breath to promote certain mind states (although that's something I don't approve of). But it can also be the case that if the breath is completely let go of it can slump into shallowness and inertia. This is common with depressive types of people. Furthermore, in modern society many people <em>start</em> meditation with an abnormal breathing pattern, due to the psycho-somatic patterns they've developed throughout their lives.</p>
<p>There are a few points to be considered here: First, just know that <strong>the breath is a powerful influence</strong> on both the body and mind. That awareness may help you be more vigilant in letting go of manipulative patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>Second, it may be useful to <strong>learn how to free the breath</strong>, as a practice separate to meditation. The breathing pattern that passes for "normal" in our society is actually very shallow and tight. To return to the kind of deep, natural breath that a baby has may feel unnatural to us simply because we have been divorced from it for so long. Many spiritual traditions offer breath training; perhaps the most profound and detailed technology is the <em>pranayama</em> breath training of Indian yoga. Engaging in activities that cause and require vigorous deep breathing, like running, or like bowing practice, can also help regulate the breath; and performing these before sitting meditation can help not only your breath but your whole energy to circulate well and settle while sitting.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>breath patterns will change</strong> when the mind changes. As you go through various stages of meditation, the breath will become deeper or shallower, or move in different rhythms. In some states, it will even flutter uncomfortably. This is where it can be very helpful to have established the habit of letting go, not fighting those changes. If there is a struggle to keep the breathing in a certain pattern, then the blood chemistry will be altered and the brain will be affected (and dizziness or nausea may arise).</p>
<p>In very simple terms, <strong>our task in meditation is to allow our energy and activity to settle</strong>. We tend to live in our heads; our energy and experience are centered in the thinking and we go out and grasp so much through the eyes and ears. Meditation and other aspects of spiritual training (should) help us come down out of our heads and into our bodies, into the real world. Coming closer to reality can be seen very simply as a downward settling of energy. For example, when you've gone for a long run or when you've danced for hours, afterward you're very relaxed and calm and in your body; life is more simple and clear, and you don't wander about in your thoughts as much. This means your energy has come down more, into the real world.</p>
<p>The ingrained self-image, however, lives in the thinking world, "up in the head". It's self-preserving habit is to keep your energy up in the head, and it is very good at tricking you into staying up there rather than settling down. It is very, very common for beginning practitioners in spiritual training to experience nausea as a result of the self-image-preserving habit. <strong>When people start to experience letting-go, they may feel an immediate and desperate fear</strong> that they will lose themselves. It is not yourself that you lose, but your false idea! But the false idea doesn't know that. The deep habit of regenerating an idea of self only wants to continue; and so letting go in meditation can actually feel life-threatening to people with a very strong self-control habit. This causes nausea — the utter rejection of the process, at a gut level. Notably, the nausea has an upward direction, opposing the settling down into reality (and "loss" of the thought-based self). The cure is to relax, reflect on the benefits of the process, and help the energy to settle downward. A remedial practice may be prescribed, of feeling the ground upon which you're sitting, or bringing attention to the soles of the feet. <strong>Intentionally bringing attention to the foundation of the posture</strong> draws the energy downward and counteracts the upward-moving nausea.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>ginger tea</strong> made of fresh ginger root is a very highly regarded drink, with a broad spectrum of healthy effects. Some of its effects are said to involve assisting digestion and combating nausea. (It is also said to be a great anti-inflammatory, good for certain types of headaches, a mild energy tonic, an anti-viral, a remedy for sore throats and colds, and an aid to circulation and generation of warmth in the body.) You may want to check it out; you might find it worthwhile to have a cup of fresh ginger tea before sittings.</p>
