  <h1>I can't detect the sensation of breath going through my nostrils</h1>

<p>This is a case where consulting a teacher would be most beneficial; not because only a teacher can give guidance, but because by connecting with a good teacher the guidance will be consitent — it will promote progress in a certain direction rather than pulling you here and there. There are several ways of approaching this issue, but they belong to different methods and schools; and although they may all be correct within the context of their stream of teaching, taken out of context they can work at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>So the first issue is: why do you meditate? What is your purpose in meditating? In fact, what is your purpose in spiritual pursuit at all? If this question is clear, then you will have more clarity about what methods to choose, and why.</p>
<p>For instance, your sincere answer to "why?" may clarify whether awareness of breath, counting breath, or some other method is best for you. But even if you don't immediately find what method is best for you, looking into the question of your life's direction and the direction of your spiritual pursuit is a most valuable activity. If you look deeply into that question, then any practice becomes your best practice, and you can digest all good and bad things and make them food for your progress.</p>
<p>In the <em>Anapanasati</em> (mindfulness of breathing) aspect of <em>Vipassana</em> meditation (which is a broad categorization of several methods), bringing attention to the breath at the nasal openings has a few things going for it. Actually, some teachers suggest that at the first few minutes of sittings you bring attention to your breath fully outside your nose, in front of your face, as this connects you to the reality that breath does not just belong to you as a separate individual, but to the whole world — you merely participate in the world's breathing.</p>
<p>The nostrils and upper lip are very sensitive, so there is the benefit that it is (or may be) possible to feel the actual passage of the breath there. The sensitivity also supports attention, since proportionally more nervous (nerve) energy flows there than at many other places in the body. (It is not wholly uncommon among Westerners to have less sensation of the breath at the nose than Asians, since many Asians and especially the Southeast Asians from whom the method derived have smaller, flatter noses that direct the breath across the upper lip.)</p>
<p>The nasal opening is also considered a beneficial site for the attention because it is a gateway between what we consider inner and what we consider outer, between the body and the environment. Attention at the gateway can provide more equanimity than attention deeper within the body that we so strongly consider 'our own'.</p>
<p>If there is difficulty with this site of attention, some teachers will allow or suggest focusing on the rise and fall of the lower abdomen. In some cultures this has blended with energy practice and internal alchemy to become a more specific guidance to focus on the point two fingers below the navel; but for the purposes of awareness of breath, it should be sufficient to attend to the rise and fall (in and out) of the belly.</p>
<p>One of the problems with attention at the belly is that it may tend to promote a controlling attitude. The practitioner may, consciously or subtly, try to control the quality or pattern of the breathing, and by extension try to control his relationship to the present situation. This is not correct practice. Correct practice is openhanded — attentive or curious rather than manipulative.</p>
<p>A second issue with attending to the belly is that it is more blunt and insensitive than the nose and upper lip, so there will almost certainly be a less refined and subtle relationship with the breath. At the nose, it is easier to perceive the fine differences in quality of the breath — smoothness, flow, evenness, and so on.</p>
<p>If you have a clear direction and know the aim of your meditation, then focusing at the belly is fine. And focusing at the nostrils is also fine, even if at first or at times you don't feel much there. Just bringing your attention there with an open, interested engagement is the practice when you don't have an actual sensation to key on. It is true that with practice, more sensitivity will almost surely appear eventually.</p>
<p>But now that I've said all that, there are two issues from your post that need to be addressed. First, you say that your meditation has been a bit directionless. That's extremely common, but not ideal; so we can work on changing that. Second, you say that you changed from counting the breath to focusing on a sensation. Those two comments ring alarm bells for me. Why change? Is this part of the directionlessness?</p>
<p>Whatever your chosen practice, it is important that you experience seeing it through all the ups and downs of real life. That means continuing open-handed, even-minded practice when the situation is good and when the situation is bad, when your mind is sharp and when your mind is dull, when the thinking wanders and judges and doubts and when boredom descends. It is the consistent, even-minded application of attention that is the gold here, not any particular state. A great many people are confused on this point, thinking that meditation has to feel a certain way, or that if it's difficult it's wrong. That's just not the case.</p>
<p>So I would like to hear from you (A) why you want to meditate, and (B) why you changed from counting the breath. If you would like to address this in private, please feel free to contact me here on Reddit. I will try to be honest about what I can and can't provide guidance for.</p>
<p>If you keep digging one hole, you can go deep; always changing will only scratch the surface. Even if your tool is not perfect, if you keep digging you will get there soon enough. If a change is in order, you should be clear about it and do it decisively, then stick with your decision and see it through.</p>
<p>If you can hook up with a good teacher and community, that would be best. Not only a teacher but also both experienced and novice meditators can all be a tremendous help, all in different ways. Other beginners can help you in ways that a Master or 'older brother' cannot. And you, in turn, already have your Dharma to bring to others. Practicing with a group can almost certainly provide you with structure and energy greater than you can summon up on your own. That will, as a matter of course, carry you along like a river until you are strong and clear enough to proceed on your own. Just don't ever imagine that you know best how your practice should proceed; the mind hides from itself until the very highest levels of attainment. Follow a time-proven method or find a good teacher to guide you.</p>
