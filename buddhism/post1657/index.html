  <h1>This ego is very strong, what should be done?</h1>

<p>Where does “terrible karma" come from? It comes from your thinking.</p>
<p>Your situation is not “terrible karma", it is very wonderful, fortunate karma. You just make the <em>idea</em> “terrible karma"; so <em>that</em> is the karma you make.</p>
<p>Everything you mention is not only workable, but full of possibility; but because of the idea you hold you make it into something terrible. It is a story about yourself, in which you are the victim who has tried everything, but who has the odds stacked against him.</p>
<p>That is ego's work, because really ego just doesn't want to surrender. It would rather hold onto the story of itself as a suffering hero than actually progress and transform.</p>
<p>So you need to change 'can't' to 'can' in your mind.</p>
<p>You can't find a teacher in New York? I'm sure that's not true. You just find excuses not to find a teacher — you find reasons not to like them or reasons why it's too difficult. Again, ego holds on to its story rather than face the possibility of surrender and change. Now we understand a bit better the emotion behind your doubt of my previous post (on the ego's habitual resistance).</p>
<p>Even if it were true that there are no teachers in New York, you would simply need to travel to where there are teachers. How valuable is practice? How much is liberation from these uncomfortable, binding thought-habits worth?</p>
<p>You can't do retreats because you will be busy? All the more reason to do retreats. If it it's important to you, find the time... <em>make</em> the time. Negotiate your work schedule if necessary. Change your living situation if necessary. If you can't do a week-long guided retreat, do a weekend-long. If you can't do a weekend-long, do a day-long. It is important for you to be in situations where your own problematic thinking doesn't have there upper hand — to put yourself into the hands of a teacher, method, and course of training.</p>
<p>You can't sit on the floor without a cushion? Use a cushion. Use a chair. Alternate between cushion and chair. Stand up. Sit against a wall if necessary. Do yoga practice. Getting physical, as I mentioned above, will also increase the circulation in your legs and help them become more pliable; but the main issue with your legs is your limiting thinking.</p>
<p>Your issues are not unique. Only ego thinks they are special. These are issues most practitioners have faced, and continue to face. I searched for a teacher for years, even leaving my home country. Practicing with my local teacher was a great benefit, and finding my main teacher (an 11-hour drive away) was a great benefit. The search was absolutely worth it. I have also gone outside of tradition to study a teacher, although means re-learning many forms. It's worth it, to access that most precious gift and resource.</p>
<p>I also continue to have pain in legs and back. It's part of the landscape we negotiate. How else will we learn to have equanimity with pain, if pain isn't part of our practice? The thinking pattern, the ego, wants its perfect situation; but for the practice-mind everything is okay, everything is workable.</p>
<p>You have a human form and life, which is incredibly fortunate. You have intelligence, the ability to communicate, the ability to take in information and consider it rationally. You have the ability to love, to put others ahead of your own preference. You have the ability to imagine, to dream new possibility and move toward it. You have, presumably, eyes and ears, nose and tongue, arms and legs: these are like miracles.</p>
<p>You also have the incredibly great fortune to have heard of the Dharma, and to be able to access it. Furthermore, to understand that Dharma is worth pursuing is tremendously rare and precious.</p>
<p>And finally, you have the leisure, the time, in which to study and practice. You are on Reddit enough that we know you can find the time if you want to.</p>
<p>So this is a really almost impossibly fortunate situation that you have. How many billions of beings don't have the resources; how many billions of beings have the resources but not the opportunity; and how many billions of beings have resource and opportunity but no motivation? You have exceptionally <em>good</em> karma, but you risk wasting it with the bad karma you are making with your thinking.</p>
<p>Only try. Try and try.</p>
<p>If it is worth it, try. If you give up, stand up again and try. If you're set back, move forward again and try. Don't believe your bad thinking. Focus on just doing it.</p>
