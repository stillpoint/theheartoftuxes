  <h1>I can't detect the sensation of breath going through my nostrils</h1>

<p>Hi;
Feel free to ask questions as you see fit. Please do take others into account. If it is a general question and others might benefit from a discussion on it, then just alert me privately that you're creating a new post. Also feel free to keep following up on this thread, or to consult me through private messages.</p>
<p>Take note that there may be aspects of meditation, or of your practice in particular, that I am not qualified to answer. If I am unclear about a point, I will try to say so; but you should also take responsibility and test whatever I might say, through your own research and experience. Also take note that I may not be on Reddit regularly; so don't take it personally if I don't reply in good time.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You say that you have been struggling with the concept of ego. I think that is exactly what is happening — experiencing difficulty because of a concept — and it is a gift that you notice your struggle. The concepts that we attach to, or that have somehow been bestowed upon us by our upbringing and education and social conditioning, cause many, many problems. Many concepts: many problems!</p>
<p>So the good news is that meditation does not rely on concepts. It is experimental and participatory. You don't need to hold any particular thought, you only need the will to look and find out for yourself.</p>
<p>It is the <em>difference</em> between one's concept and one's experience that creates disturbance. If you have no concept, then you don't need to check your experience against anything — it just is what it is. That is the more sane, balanced approach. Offloading your concepts will be a relief, and will bring you back to your natural mind, and to the world as-it-is.</p>
<p>Does this match your experience so far? The more you think about ideas of 'me' and 'not me' and what is supposed to be happening, the more disturbance there is — is it not so? Yes, there is a letting go that is required in meditation. It is there in the initial approach, it is there in each breath, it is there in each moment: the requirement to let go of the 'known' so that you can enter into real life. You die to the passing moment so that you can live in this one. And when your organism has developed enough faith in itself, then you will naturally come to a point of <em>great</em> giving-over, <em>great</em> letting go. This is sometimes called the Great Death (in contrast with small death, what we usually recognize as the death of the body).</p>
<p>But letting go of what is already dead means you get to be alive. See if this is not true within even a single breath. If you hold on to the breath that was there a moment ago, you can't proceed into the new breath that is arriving. This again is the law of nature, the law of the world: nothing is lost; in order for something to live, something has to die. It is very plain and natural. It goes on like this every second of every day. In order to pick up the box of cereal, you have to let go of the kettle. In order to meet your friend downtown, you have to leave behind your house.</p>
<p>We only use the <em>words</em> "life" and "death" and "me" and "not me"; but those words are just words. They are empty. The real thing is going on moment to moment, always moving, always changing. If you keep moving with it, then you get your real life; if you hold on to a word or idea, then you are stuck and can't move and can't get your real life.</p>
<p>So Buddhist practice is always moving, never stopping, never getting stuck. If you check, you get stuck. Checking means that you try to pause and step outside of yourself and see how you're doing and whether it fits in with what you think you know from the past. "What's my situation?" "How is it going now?" "Am I doing it, or am I failing?" "What should I do with this discomfort?" "How far have I progressed?" "Is this awareness?" "Do I lose myself when I get awareness?" All of these are checking. Don't step outside and try to judge what is happening; just be in it and keep moving. If you throw yourself into the moment with vitality, you will be able to enjoy it. Never mind if your old thinking would judge the moment to be weird or uncomfortable; throw yourself into it. "Okay! Now we're really <em>living</em>!"</p>
<p>One teacher said "Throw yourself into the abode of the Buddha." Surrender yourself to the reality of the moment, and you will experience that it is <em>okay</em>. More moments of surrender, more okay. And then more faith and stability in who you really are.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>But what I don't understand is that if it's not 'me' that's aware of my breath, what is it that is aware?</em></p>
<p>This is a wonderful question. But this is not your practice. When meditating, only return to the method. When proceeding through the day, only follow the situation.</p>
<p>If this question starts to have a life of its own in you — if you start to feel sincerely that it is fundamentally important — then that may indicate a certain spirituality starting to emerge in you. If it is more a curiosity and disturbance, then treat it like all other mental manifestations and let it go, returning to the method. In fact, never mind trying to judge (check) the quality of the question that arises; only let it go and return to the method. If it truly has a meaning to you it will return by itself and you will be clear on it without having to check.</p>
<p>For people for whom this question is a profound, glowing issue central to their lives, a different kind of meditation is natural: self-inquiry. This comes in a few forms ("who am I"/Immoko, hwadu, tracing sound back to the source, and others) that have some initial difference but soon lead to the same point. My recommendation is that you first get very skilled at letting go of thinking and returning to the method. This will anyway be a necessary part of any other meditation you engage in in the future, and without this ability any other efforts to understand will be useless.</p>
<p>Become friends with Unknowing. To the thinking self — the ego — that thinks of itself as something in particular, Unknowing seems uncomfortable and even life-threatening. But to the True Self (or what some traditions may call the Soul), Unknowing is life, and freedom, and goodness. So start developing your trust in yourself (trust in Unknowing) and letting go of dependency on concepts. That means: just do the practice.</p>
