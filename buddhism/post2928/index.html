  <h1>I just saw this on /r/nofap, what does it mean exactly?</h1>

<p>Our thoughts are not so original; they are strongly shaped by the society, family, and educational system we grow up in. Even people who think they've abandoned the thinking of their parents usually have many unconscious, automatic opinions formed by them. You don't necessarily have to have the same idea; your patterns and core beliefs can still be quite conditioned by your past even if on the surface it seems that your ideas are different.</p>
<p>So what counts is not opinion but actual insight, actual direct experience. Thirty people may have thirty different opinions about how oranges feel and taste, and thirty different descriptions of them; but only someone who has actually held and eaten an orange can know for sure which opinions are correct.</p>
<p>There are many people who have had direct insight into the nature of mind, self, and life. They have seen what passes away and what continues. Some of these people have gained such a mastery over their minds that they can perceive and even control their rebirths.</p>
<p>For instance, most of us can't control what happens to us in our dreams; we just have to go along with how they unfold, and they unfold according to how we have used our mind in the past. But some people have practiced being awake so completely that they can stay aware even while sleeping and dreaming. Within their dreams they understand the nature of their dream: the dream is not reality, it is a projection of mind. So they can experience their dream but not be fooled by it, not be controlled by it.</p>
<p>This is quite similar to the kind of insight and continuity of awareness that allow one to perceive the after-death experience and not be controlled by it. Indeed, we live our lives in a dream, a projection of our own minds. Some people, who have done what it takes to wake up, can live within the dream of life without being fooled by it.</p>
<p>So there are many people who have quite intentionally guided their own rebirth. I've had the great fortune to meet numerous <em>tulkus</em>, reincarnated masters. Their past lives are verified in many ways. In fact, there are people who are sort of experts in perceiving where a deceased master has been reborn. When they meet with the new rebirth as a child there are certain tests that are performed, where the child picks out the possessions that used to belong to their past incarnation (among other tests). In some cases the child remembers clearly their past life and can tell many verifiable details. In some cases, master and student choose to be reborn in close connection so they can continue their mutual support and beneficial activity together. It is impossible for most of us to even conceive of the abilities and attainments of these beings.</p>
<p>It may take you some time to digest these kinds of evidence if you've been used to thinking of the world in a different way. And they may not satisfy you anyway; you may need to see for yourself.</p>
<p>There is a way that we can see for ourselves without necessarily developing the extremely refined perception of these masters. We can look into and discover the nature of impermanence, through a meditative practice like Vipassana or Zen. We can see directly how things pass away, and what (if anything) continues from one moment to the next. Even relative newcomers might get some level of insight if they practice correctly and devotedly.</p>
<p>Your body, thoughts, feelings, and energy are always in movement, never the same from one moment to the next. So how is it that you have a sense or assumption of a 'you' that continues? If we look scientifically, and if we look directly, all evidence shows that nothing continues. So how do 'you' get from one moment to the next? How are 'you' reborn into the next breath or the next new day? You can discover this directly for yourself.</p>
<p>Just don't imagine you can understand it by gathering a few words and thoughts together, or without devoting focused awareness toward the issue over an extended period of practice. Buddhism teaches that we've been circling in ignorance for countless lifetimes; you can't just throw off your ignorance with a snap of the fingers.</p>
<p>In any case, you don't need to believe one way or the other about rebirth. But what <em>is</em> important is that <strong>you believe in your death</strong>. You must know deeply that you will die, that you can't hold onto anything, that everything you have and want will go away. Therefore it would be wise to make use of your remaining precious life, starting right now, today, and wake up from this dream.</p>
<p>Most people live a lie, acting as if they will live forever; and so they waste their lives until the moment death shakes their world. Let's not make that tragic mistake!</p>
