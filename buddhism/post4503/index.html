  <h1>How do I let go of anger towards somebody?</h1>

<p>I'm posting a private exchange on the topic, with another redditor who had the same question (with their permission):</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Earlier today, Reddit posted one of your comments to its Facebook page. It was one concerning the origins and solutions for anger. It was rather enlightening and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>However, a portion of it stated something to the effect of "if you were a homeless man who went through the exact same experiences as the homeless man in question, you would act the same way (in this case it was theft from OP's pocket)."</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>I don't know much about the Buddhist belief system so bear with me, but I can't say I agree with the notion that all of our actions are determined by external experiences, and that I would make the same choice as anyone else 100% of the time.</em>
&gt; 
&gt; <em>I thought, according to Buddhism, that each of us is occupying an earthly body assigned to us based on deeds (karma?) in our previous life. Because of that, I always assumed that the essence of "me," regardless of what incarnation I'm experiencing, has its own set individualistic qualities and the ability to excersize free will.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>Am I way off base here? Is there some anti-free will concept that I'm missing?</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>Thanks!</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;No, you're not off-base. We're on the same page. Your present and future results come from your previous intentions and actions. This is true for everyone. Similar intentions and actions, meeting similar conditions, produce similar results. It is clear cause and effect.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;I wouldn't say that a <em>different</em> stream of causes meeting the same stream of conditions would produce the same results. No, you are right to question that. But it's a case of "there but for the Grace of God go I". Buddhism teaches that we've been up and down, in all realms and in all types of situations through countless lives. We may not have been that particular man on that particular day, but we have been a beggar, we have been greedy and manipulative, we have been desperate, we have been overwhelmed by torment or driven by addiction... many, many times we have been all of these. And if we look deeply into our minds right now, we can see the potential for these situations to arise again. <em>Unless we are enlightened (or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sot%C4%81panna">'stream entrant'</a>), we have not eliminated the seeds of these — or worse — life situations in the future.</em> So you are right; there is no anti-free-will dogma here. But there is the requirement to see our minds deeply and honestly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;There are three levels of spiritual realization. (This is not, as far as I know, a Buddhist teaching.) In the first level, we see ourselves as separate beings making our way in a world of separate beings. Everything is either for us or against us, and we carry a certain pride, clinging jealously to our illusion of selfhood.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;At the middle level, we begin to see aspects of ourselves in others. There is a psychological insight that "oh, that person is like me" or "that person represents a part of me". Archetypes begin to emerge, symbols whose meaning is shared by all; but we still think of ourselves as separate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;At the highest level, we recognize one mind as the underpinning of all beings and phenomena. "I am he as you are he as you are me" is not just a concept, but is experienced directly. The whole world is seen as one substance undergoing transformations of appearance.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;So only in the lowest segments of the lowest level of insight would one think that another person is completely separate, and has nothing to do with oneself.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Let's add some humility and compassion to the soup here, and consider — even if we take previous karmic formations into account — if we are raised in an abusive and manipulative environment, suffer repeated hardships like shame and hunger, and contact not the wise teachings of Dharma but many examples of sinister behavior, would our behavior not be somewhat like that of the person in question or worse?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;People of course want to think the best of themselves. Already, possessing a human life, we are on top of the world, in a good situation. But we don't see the negative seeds yet to bear fruit in us. We don't see how easily things could turn for the worse. We only want to think that we are noble and wise and superior.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;The name for that is <em>ego's delusion</em>.</p>
