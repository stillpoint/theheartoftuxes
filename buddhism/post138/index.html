  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This happens because of karma -- the chain of cause-and-effect based on your past intentions and actions. Because of the way you've used your mind and body in the past, now you deal with the natural unfolding of results.</p>
<p>It's like drawing a line on the earth with a stick. If you only do it once, and only lightly, maybe you can't even see the line. But if you draw the line more forcefully or repeatedly, the line in the earth gets deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>If you stop, then for a while the line persists; and then after some wind or one or two rainfalls it gets erased, its expression ends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don't stop but keep drawing and drawing, the line becomes deeper and more lasting. Not only that, but it creates a rut and then it becomes more difficult to even draw in a different way. Maybe the rut lasts through several seasons or years.</p>
<p>This is all natural cause and effect. But with karma, once the rut is there you can't force it away. You can only stop making the same rut, and avoid messing around with it and re-tracing.</p>
<p>So to compare, throughout this life (and countless previous lives) you've used your mind how? With attachment, distraction, indulgence -- like almost all of us. The amount of time and intensity you've spent following true teachings -- how does it compare to the time and intensity you've spent in trivial activity, personal drama, distracting entertainment, wishful imagination, doubt and gossip and self-righteous thinking? What are the lines you've drawn with your thought and activity?</p>
<p>So even if sometimes you begin to see clearly and begin to realize the truth of the good teachings, the lines you've drawn will often obscure it. You'll often fall into the old ruts. It happens by natural process.</p>
<p>Therefore it is wise to make use of external supports <em>that aren't conditioned by attachment, habit, ego</em>. It is wise to have frequent association with teachers whose wisdom and compassion are unconditional, <em>beyond</em> those drawn lines. It is wise to make commitments that ensure your connection with the teacher and teaching, even at times when habit and preference would otherwise take over and block you.</p>
<p>It is wise to associate with <em>true friends</em>, people who have themselves made real (not just voiced) commitment to pursuit and practice of truth.</p>
<p>It is wise to gather conditions and structures that point you back to the Dharma even when you would otherwise wander off, back into your ruts. Being meticulous about receiving true teaching. Being meticulous about receiving consistent teaching, not mixing styles or shopping for new versions. Committing to courses of study. Scheduling daily practice, monthly re-affirmations, and yearly intensive practice to always move you forward. Gradually bringing sleep, diet, physical movement, work, and rest into balance. Gradually building health. Progressively clearing, organizing, and simplifying your living space and lifestyle. Gathering environmental, physical, mental, and emotional influences that bring you back to what's important in life, back to the Dharma. Performing ethical actions. Performing compassionate actions. Performing generous actions. Strengthening connection with Sangha, with the community of Dharma-followers. Letting go of negative and meaningless relationships; cultivating truth-based and meaningful relationships. Cultivating connection with your teacher, lineage, and path. Using repetition and ritual to bring you back to the central point again and again and again.</p>
<p>People hate the idea of being beholden to form. The ego wants to be king of life, controlling every eventuality and deciding solely based on its own selfish whim. Therefore the myth of freedom is perpetuated by the ego. "I can do what I want, because I'm free." But then the ego draws in the earth with its same old, dead, predictable, self-obsessed pattern; and the ruts are made and deepened; and <em>that is not freedom!</em></p>
<p>But those who have luckily encountered good teaching and have woken up a little bit realize that they need the Dharma in order to achieve freedom, and that they need to use form to help them keep returning to Dharma. Committing to form does not have the flavor of oppression to them; it has the flavor of aspiration, enthusiasm, energy, joy, and good sense.</p>
<p>So don't attach to the past. Never mind about "What if?" When you see the way clearly, then earnestly set about gathering the conditions that will keep bringing you back to good teaching and practice. When you don't see clearly, remember what you've learned and use it to find your way back:    </p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not clear. I need more practice." (Perhaps daily bowing. Perhaps classes or retreats. Or...?)</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not clear. I need to spend more time with my teacher." </p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not clear. I need to let go of meaningless complications and focus on what's important." (Stop complaining. <em>Do</em> something.)</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not clear. Let me take a conscious breath right now and put everything down."</p>
