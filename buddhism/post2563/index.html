  <h1>I can't detect the sensation of breath going through my nostrils</h1>

<p>Hi again.</p>
<p>No annoyance so far; I'm happy to help if I can. I was sorry to hear your statement of mistrust, though. I don't know what causes you to equate white Buddhists with bleeding-heart schtick, but let me just suggest that in <em>every</em> community, white or otherwise, Buddhist or otherwise, there <em>will be bullshit</em>; so that just means you have to be self-responsible and not expect the community to be perfect. But there will be other stuff besides the bullshit that can be pretty awesome. In my experience, most Buddhist communities at least have a sincere intent, and that's nothing to scoff at. At best, many of the most glowing, vibrant, bravely individual, and noble examples of humans I've met have been a part of Buddhist communities â€” including, if I stoop to use the categorization, "whites".</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Karma is very, very specific. It is not a generalized or vague cosmic mechanism that brings retribution; that would be more of a superstitious view. The process of karma is based on causality: this cause arises, this result appears; this different cause arises, this different result appears. Cause and effect are very specific, very clear.</p>
<p>The word "karma" is translated literally as "action", or "action-intention". It means the actions that you generate, first with your mind and then with your speech and physical activity. "Your" karma is everything you make, moment to moment, and everything you have made in the past. It is a very specific array or constellation or pattern of activity.</p>
<p>Everything you do has an effect. That point is fairly clear to most people if they think about it, although we often act as though we don't actually believe it. But what is not as clear to many is that your intentions themselves produce effects. People seem to believe that they can keep their own inner life encapsulated and indulge in all kinds of harmful thoughts; but just as in physics or chemistry, every energy must be accounted for.</p>
<p><em>For example: I may do a lot of good action with my speech and body like say maybe charity work, but if in my mind I stay resentful of a certain person, then a pattern of energy is built up. I become more easily frustrated or resentful of other things as well; maybe I more easily take unreasonable action against the object of my resentment or against myself or others. My mental energy being channeled into resentment means it is diverted from its free flow in engaging with the moment â€” I am less in reality and more in my thinking â€” so maybe I make mistakes in my work or am careless in my relationships. All of these patterns produce results that I will experience.</em></p>
<p>Mind precedes everything else; all manifestations arise from mind. This is stated in many Buddhist teachings. (Check, for instance, one of the primary Buddhist texts, the Dhammapada, which I've quoted below.) So whatever actions you take and whatever results you get from them come initially from your own mind. If you do consistent meditation, over time you will see this for yourself; you will see the patterns that unfold in your life because of how you use your mind.</p>
<p>Every movement of energy you take has an effect. And the more energy you put into a certain activity, the greater the effect. If you make an intention with great force â€” great anger or great devotion, say â€” then the effect will be strong. If you make a small intention repeatedly, many thousands of times, then the effect will be strong. It is like anything in nature: a big tidal wave can obliterate a coastal city; and a little stream of water running continuously can cut through a mountainside.</p>
<p>To be accurate, the word <em>karma</em> refers just to the initial intent and action. The results are called <em>karma-phala</em>, the "fruits of intent and action". You plant an apple seed, you get apple fruit. You plant an orange seed, you get an orange fruit. You plant prejudice seed, you get prejudice fruit â€” you keep yourself from accessing something that can be of benefit, and keep yourself from relating bravely and compassionately with others. Then your life appears, the way you shaped it.</p>
<p>Your individual intent and action makes your individual life. Our intent and action together makes our shared world.</p>
<p>To understand how the process of karma unfolds, you can observe how things relate and develop in nature. Some things take a moment or a day to unfold; others take years or millennia. You may plant an apple seed and expect apple fruit, but it will also depend on <em>conditions</em>: how is the earth, water, light, heat, wind? Are there conditions that will infest or otherwise harm the growing tree? Are there conditions (like an ice age) that will keep the seed dormant for a long time? Likewise, we can see that the seeds of our action-intentions will bear fruit according to the conditions they grow in. Good seeds can fail to reach their full potential if we maintain bad conditions; and bad seeds can be averted from their most harmful conclusions if we maintain good conditions. But karmic seeds are never lost; all energy must be accounted for.</p>
<p>Seed and field (action and condition) determine how things unfold. Even the Buddha said that he cannot bring to enlightenment those who don't have the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>By the way, you have already brought yourself to connect with the white Buddhist community. I, as presumably many others here, am a "white Buddhist". I hope you find some good spiritual companionship. If it falls through, then try again.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;Mind is the forefunner of all actions.
&gt;
&gt;All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.
&gt;
&gt;If one speaks or acts with a corrupt mind, suffering follows,
&gt;
&gt;As the wheel follows the hoof of an ox pulling a cart.</p>
<p>&gt;Mind is the forerunner of all actions.
&gt;
&gt;All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.
&gt;
&gt;If one speaks or acts with a serene mind, happiness follows,
&gt;
&gt;As surely as one's shadow.</p>
<p>[Dhammapada Ch. 1 <em>Twins</em>, trans. Ven. Ananda Maitreya]</p>
