  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>We have a long way to go. That's our shared human situation. Our life is not perfect; our practice is not perfect. What can we do?</p>
<p>Rigid perfectionism puts practice into the realm of idealism rather than reality. It is a phase that many practitioners go through. But when you grow up a bit in practice you start to embrace your humanity and the fact that you manifest both sublime and petty creations.</p>
<p>The aim of practice is not to condemn the pettiness. Actually, we don't know why our movements appear and where they take us. The judging, condemning mind itself is to be released. We need to grow out of it, like growing out of schoolyard squabbles.</p>
<p>We are so habituated to making ourselves into something. We aim at a feeling and try to get it. We aim at an image and try to approximate it. And even when we think we are being sincere about practice, our making and doing and approximating habit takes over: we try to be the 'good practitioner', the 'perfect Buddhist'.</p>
<p>The true perfect Buddhist is like a rocket shooting to heaven, not following any external signs, not trying to <em>be</em> anything.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>The Great Way is not difficult for those who do not pick and choose.</strong></p>
<p>So you need to put down trying to be the good and perfect student. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try or you shouldn't hold yourself to high standards; it means don't try to be <em>something</em>. If you find yourself becoming something in particular — a self-image, a role — drop it immediately, and run in the other direction.</p>
<p>Monk style is okay for monks. Regular style is okay for regular people. Unusual style is okay for unusual people. No need to decide ahead of time which way you should be. No need to 'pick and choose'. Follow your life situation, case by case, and your life will unfold in its own way. When nothing gets in the way of a willow or a pine, willow and pine unfold each in their own way.</p>
<p>This all points to a more mature, stable, persevering compassion. Train your compassion, for yourself and others; make your main life direction right; and everything else will follow. You are allowed to relax. You are allowed not to have everything arranged. You are not expected to be the one in control of outcomes. Buddha does that.</p>
<p>But when you realize that you've made a wrong turn, that's when your compassion functions. It is very clear and practical. If you blame yourself and build guilt and resistance, you get mired in your own tangled thought. If compassion functions very quickly, you can soon correct the mistake, turn back in the right direction, and keep moving toward the destination.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, there is the teaching of 'near enemies' — qualities that at first glance may seem to be positive, but are really inferior or negative facsimiles. Desperate grasping at attainment may be mistaken for sincerity, but if you take a closer look you'll see that it is ego-driven. It is really our attempt to gain control. The desperation itself is already out of control. <em>True</em> control lets everything settle in itself: the days can move as they move, emotions can flow as they flow, outcomes are given over to the great unknown. "Let the chips fall where they may." We do not manipulate; we do not touch. We only take care of our relationship to the moment: Is it clear?</p>
<p>You may know by now that relaxation is very important in meditation. When sitting, it is necessary to be both awake and relaxed. One without the other is out of balance. But do you know that relaxation in regular life is also very important? You are allowed to trust yourself! You don't have to walk on tenterhooks, fearful of making mistakes. Let your compassion grow, little by little, and things will go well. If a mistake appears, soon correct it.</p>
<p>We have been going around and around in Samsara for aeons. It won't all turn around just because we force ourselves into an imagined perfection for a few years. It is a long-term project. Our practice will go on for many, many lifetimes; so let's just commit to that and set to the work of the moment. Because if we continue to try imposing our idea upon the situation, that is the same dualistic mind that's been making the whole mess for countless lifetimes. Put it all down and get down to the work of the moment.</p>
<p>Never mind stories about 'my' this and 'my' that. Untuned persistence, addiction to Dhamma. More tangled thought. Put it down.</p>
<p>You say you don't understand what to do to because you get tangled in thought. You're right that you get tangled in thought, and that it's a problem; but you're not right that you don't know what to do. Put it down. You know what that means; you just have to do it.</p>
<p>It's not that people don't know how to put it down; it's that they soon check and judge the result. Instead of just putting it down and letting it be, they put it down and then pick it back up again, looking to see what the effect is. And they decide that it's not good enough, and so they look for other strategies of manipulation, trying to make something happen, trying to get a particular state, trying to become someone or something. That is not putting it down! Put it down in a moment. If thinking comes back, let it go again. And again. Each time, one time. Each time, only now: let it go, put it down, don't touch.</p>
<p>If you ever need a teacher about putting it down, gaze at the sky, or ask a tree or rock, or go meet a baby. These are great teachers of putting it all down.</p>
<p>As to practice container, what teachers and schools are in your area? Do some research and start looking. Hang out with a Sangha. You don't have to get married to them or give them all your money. Just attend some talks or services, and if there is some hint of possibility there, take a workshop or meditation course. That is how you start to build your practice container. Find a teacher and community, and little by little start to be more accountable to them. Let practice schedule find a little place in your life. Let generosity and commitment to others find a little place in your life. Just a little, just relaxed, step by step.</p>
<p>Those who swoop in and determine to finish it all with one great effort are like young men who don't yet know how to be with a woman: they tend not to last. Relax, enjoy, follow the movement of things from moment to moment.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One of the most useful teachings for all spiritual practitioners is the teaching about the human shadow and Spiritual Bypassing. This is such valuable material; I wish it would soon be incorporated in regular public school and high-school curriculum, not to mention courses of spiritual training. At a basic level, <strong>teaching about the human shadow</strong> brings awareness to how the things we ignore, deny, avoid, and suppress in ourselves inevitably get projected onto our experience of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Bypassing</strong> is the expression of the shadow in spiritual pursuits:</p>
<p>&gt;Spiritual Bypassing, a term first coined by psychologist John Welwood in 1984, is the use of spiritual practices and beliefs to avoid dealing with our painful feelings, unresolved wounds, and developmental needs. It is much more common than we might think and, in fact, is so pervasive as to go largely unnoticed, except in its more obvious extremes.</p>
<p>I've provided links on Shadow Work and Spiritual Bypassing several times before. Here they are again. May we all wake up together:</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I highly recommend Shadow Work and work on Spiritual Bypassing to all people serious about practice. It keeps the spiritual path from turning into a somewhat fundamentalist and illusory ideal, and opens the way for a very broad compassion that can embrace all kinds of people and all kinds of behaviors.</em></p>
