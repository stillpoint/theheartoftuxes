  <h1>Had a disheartening experience at a Zen center, need some help making sense of it.</h1>

<p>I read your post with interest, and I was moved to respond so that you can hopefully make sense of the experience and be able to distinguish between the part of it that actually happened "out there" and the part that happened within yourself because of unfamiliarity and projection. Both sides are likely involved; it's seldom the case that we have a completely clear and equanimous relationship to events, and it's also seldom the case that what we experience is <em>totally</em> based on our own filters or reactivity.</p>
<p>There are several points to be addressed in what you write, and they should be addressed individually in our conversation rather than be all summed up in blanket statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sense of unwelcoming</li>
<li>the focus on form, and insistence on specific posture</li>
<li>the offer to strike with the meditation stick</li>
<li>the difficulty staying mindful</li>
</ul>
<p>You say that you found the group leaders to be unwelcoming. That raises the questions both of <strong>what you find to be welcoming</strong> and <strong>what you were expecting</strong>.</p>
<p>It is true that zen folks and the zen culture often may do away with some social conventions. This is part of a general drive to <strong>get at the heart of the matter</strong>: instead of catering to our desire to be comforted we look into the false sense of self which always seeks out and grasps at its comfort. Instead of being nicey-nicey, we look to let go of ego-based distractions and get to the bottom of it all. "Who <em>am</em> I? Who or what seems to require reassurance and comforting words and actions?"</p>
<p>None of us who were not there at the center you visited can say whether the atmosphere was truly unwelcoming or whether it was merely clearing the way for a deeper look into relationship. But please consider that just because the mood or manner was unfamiliar to you doesn't mean it was not compassionate. It may just be that the compassion is in offering you back to yourself rather than coddling you and causing you to continue relying on outside support.</p>
<p>In Zen, <strong>we begin with faith in ourselves</strong>. We recognize from the very beginning that our value and okayness doesn't come from outside sources but is and always has been our original nature. That message gets reinforced and actualized through practice: whether newcomer or old-timer, it is up to you to come to terms with the universe on your own, moment to moment. The ego doesn't like this style, but the spirit is nourished by it.</p>
<p>It is patently untrue to claim, as some do, that "Zen is cold". Nothing could be farther from the truth. <strong>Zen, if it is true Zen, is utterly engaged with life, utterly open to the moment.</strong> It just doesn't posture and fret and add embellishment to what is already okay. What this means for <em>us</em> in our experience of Zen is that there is a lot of space, a lot of emptiness, a lot of letting-be. If we are used to filling in the space with "nice" activities, "spiritual" ideas, "useful" projects, and so on, then we may feel very anxious indeed when someone holds to the spaciousness. But the silence and space don't mean you are bad if you move or think; they mean <strong>you are already okay</strong> without adding anything extra, and they are meant to help you experience that for yourself.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that you enter a zen-style situation without having all of this explained. You are at a loss for context, and so you fall back on your own context, what you have previously learned to be normal behavior. But another aspect of Zen training is that <strong>it focuses on experience rather than explanation</strong>. We trade our concepts for experience; we trade thinking-understanding for real life. In Zen training, you can expect to be thrown into situations without explanation. Far from being a belittlement, it is a recognition that you are perfectly capable of sustaining <em>yourself</em> and finding your own way through. Even if <em>you</em> don't yet know that, the teacher and community hold that knowledge for you until you step into it.</p>
<p>A large part of holding the wisdom for you is form. <strong>When you have a clear form, you have a clear mirror for yourself.</strong> You can notice the slightest deviation, and so you can better see your own mind. Why deviate from your noble mind and posture? If you've done lengthy meditation before you already know how we tend to run away from the plainness of the moment. We fidget with the body by shifting and rearranging, and we fidget with the mind by making inner dramas and dialogues. This is usually our habitual effort to escape plainness, spaciousness, emptiness. So adherence to form helps us to see that habit and train our ability to let it go and move beyond it. This is incredibly significant! It means <strong>we are training in okayness</strong>, in happiness, in the ability to show up in real life. It matures into the saintly quality of showing up for others, regardless of whether the situation is our favorite or not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when form is unclear, that becomes the foothold for ego. Within that compromise, our self-serving indulgence creeps in and we allow our manipulative and craving habits to grow. A hair's-breadth difference is all it takes for our practice to turn from "this, as-it-is, is okay" to "let me just adjust this one little thing...." Just one cookie. Just one little sexual affair. Just one little wasteful act. Just one little military incursion.</p>
<p>Because Zen has compassion for all beings, it is very clear and dedicated to the form of practice.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>this has a wide range of interpretations and styles</strong>. Some zen centers may insist on a certain posture, held without moving throughout the sitting period. Others allow standing up and/or changing sitting postures whenever necessary, while requiring stillness otherwise. All of the forms have compassion as their motive, even if they are expressed very differently. They all aim to help you experience your original okayness, but they go about it in different ways.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't like the styles that insist on specific rigid postures. I think these styles come from a culture where sitting cross-legged on the ground is part of everyday life from birth onward, and so the bodies of practitioners are generally prepared for that kind of posture. For many westerners and those who grow up in a more western way of moving, forcing the body into these postures can cause great pain and injury.</p>
<p><strong>At some point we need to come to terms with pain</strong>; we need to recognize that we can't escape it, and we need to accept it in total surrender. But that doesn't mean we need to be ignorant about injury. Letting go of attachment to the body doesn't mean harming or doing away with the body.</p>
<p>Many Asian meditation teachers will encourage students to just keep sitting, keep trying the posture. Keep trying, they say, and your body will adapt. Let the mind go, and the body will adapt. I think they are not aware of the difference between their bodies and the bodies of many westerners. For many people, it may be true that the body will adapt to the posture; but for some, forcing the point breaks the body down. So you have to be your own advocate. You have to be the teacher's equal (which you are), and decide for yourself whether the pain is something to be accepted and softened and overcome, or whether it's a signal that this particular posture or practice is not good for you. You are the one who has to take care of your bodymind.</p>
