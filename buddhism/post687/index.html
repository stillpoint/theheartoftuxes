  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Two perspectives, one more basic and one more advanced:</p>
<p>From the Dhammapada Ch. 5 "The Fool"</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Long is the night to the sleepless; long is the league to the weary. Long is worldly existence to fools who know not the Sublime Truth.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal, let him resolutely pursue a solitary course; there is no fellowship with the fool.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>The fool worries, thinking, "I have sons, I have wealth." Indeed, when he himself is not his own, whence are sons, whence is wealth?</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>A fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent, but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Though all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Though only for a moment a discerning person associates with a wise man, quickly he comprehends the Truth, just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soup.</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>From the transmitted teachings of Zen Master Kyong Ho (or Kyung Ho)</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...Be like water flowing. Keep both good friends and bad friends. Donâ€™t reject anything.... My only hope is that you completely cut off discriminating thinking.</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One says we should eventually leave those who are not better or equal. Leave fools behind, and spend time with good and wise people. The other says we shouldn't discriminate, and that we should be friendly with both wise people and fools.</p>
<p>The context is important.</p>
<p>As you say, your mind is a sponge. For the common person, the mind latches onto and absorbs its surroundings. Negative people bring you negativity; positive people bring you positivity. For the common person and for the beginner, it is very important to control the environment, because the mind itself is not yet under control.</p>
<p>But if you follow this to the extreme, you leave behind compassion and you avoid the challenges that teach you and help you to grow. It is important to protect your mind's seedling of spirituality, to provide it with a good growing environment; but don't go overboard with it.</p>
<p>As you start to understand practice and the kind of effort that's required of you, to let go of forms and return to equanimity, you can start to digest negative surroundings and experiences better. Even someone who has been well parented, with a high degree of emotional intelligence, can be in negative circumstances and use them as growing experiences. With practice your ability to do this becomes stronger.</p>
<p>Then as practice matures and your center becomes stronger â€” that is, when external things don't push your mind around as much â€” it doesn't matter as much whether the external situation is nice or nasty. This means you can practice clarity and compassion regardless of what others around you are doing. Your mind becomes less like a sponge and more like a smooth gem: radiant, indivisible, and not 'sticky'. Your mind will be free and independent rather than soaking up whatever is around it.</p>
<p>So Master Kyong Ho was talking to people who already had some stability of mind, some strong center. For these people the higher practice is to embrace everything equally, without discrimination. And sometimes a teacher may push you ahead into this kind of training before you think you're ready for it; but a good teacher often knows the timing better than you. In any case, this is where practice is heading: complete equanimity, unconditional love. It doesn't matter where you are or who you are with; you just stay clear. But if you are just starting out and your center is weak and movable, and your mind soaks up everything it touches, you may have to gather good circumstances.</p>
<p>On this topic there's another point. We are to a large extent at the mercy of our karma. Unless we were born saints we have some blend of positive and negative karma accumulated. Although we have the incredibly auspicious karma to be born human and to have some contact with the Dharma, we also have huge backlog of negative thoughts and deeds ready to unfold when they meet their conditions. So even though we may wish to practice Dharma, we may have to endure difficult or negative circumstances for some time, until the negative karma creating obstacles for us is extinguished. During this difficult time, if we give up and engage in negative activity, we just create more future difficulty. But if we practice positive, Dharmic thought and activity even though our situation is negative, that creates very beneficial karma; and in the future our practice will be facilitated and supported by external conditions. This is all a matter of what we do with what we have.</p>
<p>So even if your center (your 'Dharma energy') is not yet strong, although you may have to face negative circumstances you should not give up on practice. Ethical guidelines, meditative practice, and good actions like generosity and kindness will help you to build the circumstances for deep practice in the future.</p>

<p>See the rest of <a href="http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=3050&amp;wr_id=3">Kyong Ho's story</a> as well as other events in his life here.</p>
<p>~~~~</p>
<p>My direct advice for you: keep your mind as simple as possible. Don't fret over how to change or escape your situation for now. Just follow what comes up. At dinner time, eat; at work time, work; at sleep time, sleep. When you have the chance for privacy, retreat. When you have a choice of activities, choose something enlivening and supportive. But most of all, don't let your mind spin into worry. Take care of your simple moments, and the future will take care of itself.</p>
