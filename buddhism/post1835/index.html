  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Does it need to be a Buddhist, or specially a Zen Buddhist? Does it need to be a monk or a person who is following Buddhism and close to enlightment?</em></p>
<p>It depends on what you want. You can learn meditation in its various forms from various teachers. Having a teacher who has integrity and knowledge (and if you're lucky, wisdom) is a great benefit regardless of the style you practice.</p>
<p>But you chose Soto Zen and shikantaza for a reason. Do you want to say why? If you want to practice Soto Zen, you need a Soto Zen teacher; and yes, it should be someone who had been authorized to teach. It doesn't have to be a monk or priest; but it needs to be someone who is stable in their practice and who has completed a course of training and been publicly approved by their master to teach.</p>
<p>Some teachers are allowed to pass on the sitting, walking, and daily life practice and help people in their own, as well as lead sittings or form practice communities. Other teachers are allowed to teach all levels of the practice, including koans (if they are used in the school). Only a Zen Master, someone who has 'received transmission' from their master and has been confirmed by other masters, is allowed to teach completely freely in their own style (e.g., to form their own school).</p>
<p>Any of these kinds of teachers should prove to be a wonderful influence. You will find that just being around strong, devoted practitioners has an inspiring and stabilizing influence on you.</p>
<p>Of course, it is extremely auspicious to even meet an enlightened person. You should take every chance to make contact with enlightened beings. It deepens your karmic connection to Dharma. If you are devoted to Buddhism, then try to find a Buddhist teacher. There are many good ways; but if you choose Buddhism, continue to deepen your connection with it so that the river of its teachings and benefits can flow through you.</p>
<p>But if your teacher has not yet gained enlightenment, no problem. You are still on the same path together, still heading in the same direction. That is most important: to always head in the right direction. Our habit-mind makes a world of opposites: we think in terms of bad and good, we compare levels. But that is illusion. What is important is to be clear on your direction: moment to moment, wake up, be clear, and act with compassion that comes from clarity. Wake up from the dream of life and save all beings from suffering. It is a great, noble direction. It is called the <em>Great Bodhisattva Way</em>; and it is what you embody moment to moment in shikantaza.</p>
<p>Whether your teacher is enlightened or not yet, they are still also human. Honor the teacher, know the person. Know the difference between the two. Help your teacher to be a good teacher. Sometimes you do this by fulfilling their teachings in your own practice; sometimes by offering practical support and generous giving: sometimes you do this by helping your teacher go beyond their difficult human qualities. It is very profound training in saving all beings, as you move from the realm of hopeful fantasy and idealism to the real world where true compassion is applied.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Yes, I do shikantaza.</em></p>
<p>You can try it; but unless your mind is uncommonly still it will likely be too difficult to maintain. You may need to do an object-based practice for a time, like following the breath or counting the breath. It is the same practice, but with slight variation to provide an anchor -- somewhere for the mind to return instantly when you find it wandering.</p>
<p>But in any case, don't try to change practice in the middle of a sitting. If you have a chosen practice, only do it. Don't let doubt, wavering, tinkering, and fidgeting enter. Don't check your practice while you're doing it; only do it, 100%. This is very important. Zen style is <em>only do it!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to try a different practice, devote proper time to it. Apply patience and perseverance. Think in terms of a few months rather than a few days. The mind's habits and obscurations have been ingrained for many lifetimes; this is a long-term project. That's a relief, in a way: when you have the long view, you can relax into your practice and become very momentary and non-judgmental about it. Just decide that you will continue without stopping for ten thousand years, ten thousand lifetimes. (Yes, people decide it and live like that!) It is a sublime practice. It is a joy to sit or move with clarity, with integrity, with sincerity. So only do it, without checking and comparing.</p>
<p>Good?</p>
<p>Thank you for your wonderful practice.</p>
