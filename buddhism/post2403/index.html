  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The title <em>Dalai Lama</em> comes from his name, <em>Gyatso</em> (= <em>Dalai</em> in Mongolian) which means 'Ocean', and <em>Lama</em> which refers to a spiritual teacher and someone who has mastered a spiritual practice and can convey it to others. So 'Ocean-Teacher' or 'Ocean of Blessing' is what Dalai Lama means literally. It also conveys the sense that his compassion for others is vast and inexhaustible like an ocean.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama himself always claims to be just a simple monk. That is how he introduces himself, and how he wishes to be regarded. Of course, he knows that <em>others</em> make a big deal of him and he fulfills the role of the spiritual leader and best known spokesperson of Tibet; but I've never heard him refer to himself as anything other than a simple monk.</p>
<p>I've also never heard the Dalai Lama refer to himself as holy. He is always very humble, and never wavers from it, so I can't imagine him ever claiming to be holy. What we're left in your question is why <em>others</em> might see him as holy; and that means we need to define what 'holy' refers to.</p>
<p>This is one of those words that, like 'love' and 'God', is understood in a thousand different ways by different people. A somewhat technical definition may be that holiness is the state of unity with original emptiness — our essential nature, which is pure and open like empty space. What do you consider holy? Some people are aggressive toward the notion of holiness; they don't like the notion that something could be considered sacred, and want to keep everything on a physical, mundane level. What's that about — why the aggression or fear? There's a realm or level of perception that some people are not ready to accept.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we might come to some general agreement about the qualities that would be described as 'holy'. Maybe qualities like compassion, love, presence, being self-possessed, having unfailing groundedness in reality (not fantasizing, not being carried away by thought), imparting a positive and uplifting effect on others, being truthful, being sincere, expressing benefit through one's actions, not being moved by the Eight Worldly Winds (pleasure, pain, loss, gain, praise, blame, fame, and shame).... There are surely more qualities we could come up with, but maybe that's enough.</p>
<p>Next, we might consider how often those qualities are embodied, how consistently they are put into action, and how deeply.</p>
<p>By these standards, the Dalai Lama might be regarded as holy. Despite the tremendous suffering he has seen, the violence and oppression his nation has endured, the threats leveled at him, and the temptations of power and prestige his position offers, he has very consistently displayed all of these beneficial qualities. Unfailingly, by all reports.</p>
<p>But if you don't want to think of him as holy or use the word holy, no problem. Although inability to have reverence for compassionate teachers and enlightened beings reveals how distant one's own consciousness is from the Dharma, it is still possible to pursue the path of Dharma step by step. As wisdom about your own true nature grows, and as you see first-hand how far you are from fully embodying your true nature and <em>what it takes</em> to live a life of unfailing integrity, your ability to perceive holiness will grow and thus reverence will grow.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There is a Zen story that illustrates this point:</p>
<p>&gt;Through history, politically powerful figures have often liked to associate themselves with spiritually powerful ones. Maybe they feel some spirituality will rub off on them, and maybe all the same they like to imagine their own power of rule might extend to the spiritual realm.</p>
<p>&gt;So it happened that the emperor of Korea invited a great Zen Master of that era, Man Hak, to meet with him.</p>
<p>&gt;Wanting to seem unthreatened by such a 'holy' presence, the emperor suggested a friendly icebreaker: the two would exchange friendly insults, as brothers or good buddies might do.</p>
<p>&gt;Zen Master Man Hak agreed.</p>
<p>&gt;So the emperor started off: "Man Hak! Your face is pushed in, with a turned-up nose. You look so much like a pig!" (And then the emperor laughed loudly.)</p>
<p>&gt;Next was Man Hak's turn: he bowed with great reverence, saying "Emperor! You are a Buddha!"</p>
<p>&gt;The emperor was first puzzled, then tried to explain: "Man Hak, you don't understand the game. We can dispense with formality. You don't have to flatter me. We're just trading friendly insults here."</p>
<p>&gt;Man Hak responded: "Oh, I understand, emperor. A pig sees everything as a pig. A Buddha sees everything as a Buddha."</p>
<p>This is a wonderful story. In our case, it means that whether you see the Dalai Lama as holy or not depends on <em>your</em> mind. If your mind has no holiness, you can't see it in the world, you can't see it even if a great holy being appears in front of you.</p>
