  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Congratulations on turning to Buddhism. I hope you and all of us find the heart of the Dharma rather than attaching to '-isms'.</p>
<p>There are many ways. Some kind of practice is necessary — you need to participate in the Dharma in order to really be a Buddhist — and you need some measure of mental stability and mindfulness to do so; but that doesn't necessarily mean sitting in the usual formal meditation posture.</p>
<p>Even within meditation, there are many forms you might not be aware of. My root master highly recommended physical practice, not only as a necessary part of overall training, but also as an alternative for those who are averse to sitting meditation or too agitated to practice it. I also recommend physical practice to many people; it is very effective at centering the mind, and settling and circulating the energy.</p>
<p>There are three general categories of practitioners, according to their main interface with life: body-centered, heart-centered, and mind-centered. Most teaching that has appeared in the west has strongly mind-centered approach, although even then traditional paths will embrace all three aspects. But people who would otherwise naturally and spontaneously encounter life and express themselves more through the heart or body tend to have those aspects covered up by layers of familial and cultural conditioning. They may not even realize that they are not inherently centered in the heart or body, since so much of our society is mind-focused (including this very online forum, and all electronic media and books).</p>
<p>Many of the more common meditations are appreciated by mind-centered practitioners. That's not to say they aren't effective for, and appreciated by, others; but there's a sort of natural 'fit' or connection.</p>
<p>Mind-centered practitioners often do well with introspective and analytical practice. The flowering of their Dharma is usually expressed in great wisdom.</p>
<p>Heart-centered practitioners often do well with devotional practice. The flowering of their Dharma is usually expressed in tremendous faith and love.</p>
<p>Body-centered practitioners often do well with ethical and mindfulness practices (and of course physical practices like prostrations). The flowering of their Dharma is usually expressed in overflowing goodness.</p>
<p>These are three general categories comprising the countless ways people can come to liberation. Neither is better or worse; so we should avoid ignorant prejudice against one path or another, regardless of the path that suits us in particular.</p>
<p>The three categories also reflect the establishment of the Three Jewels through practice:    </p>
<ul>
<li>Mind-centered practice moves from ignorance to enlightenment on the basis of the Dharma.</li>
<li>Heart-centered practice moves from torment to satisfaction on the basis of the Buddha.</li>
<li>Body-centered practice moves from harm to benefit on the basis of the Sangha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, traditional practice incorporates all three aspects; but styles, and especially specific methods, vary as to their emphasis.</p>
<p>A lot of newcomers read a lot of books. That's not ideal. It's not necessarily terrible, but after a point — which tends to be sooner rather than later — it doesn't actually nourish you. And continuing to read when you should actually be practicing hurts your integrity, belies karmic realities, and ingrains the bad habit of looking in the wrong place for satisfaction.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, any reading you do should be only one part, to ten parts of practice. If you read for one hour, you should practice for ten hours. The reading only becomes wisdom if you actually act upon what you've read. In life activity the material becomes digested and integrated. But if you only accumulate ideas, that is an obstacle to the path, since it crystallizes concept and opinion.</p>
<p>Concept and opinion are obstacles on two accounts: First, until you get proper living training from an awakened teacher who knows where all of the concepts fit in with each other, your own concepts will be limited, and out of context, and sometimes applied at the wrong time, and sometimes altogether mistaken.</p>
<p>Second, concept itself is limited and cannot convey the essential basis of Buddhadharma. Although some instruction and communication is necessary, only attaining the point <em>beyond words</em> can actually move you to liberation.</p>
<p>So you don't necessarily have to do a common formal sitting practice; but you do have to be active in Dharma practice, with mindfulness and ethical activity at the forefront.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Why do you not meditate? Do you feel too much pressure? Do you dislike it? Are you not clear on what you should be doing?</p>
<p>It's quite provocative to say, but <em>if meditation isn't your absolute favorite thing to do, something is missing in your approach.</em> Because meditation essentially means you get to be your complete, brilliantly aware, satisfied self — as you are, with no guilt, struggle, avoidance, or apology. If that is not your experience, then there is something to be attended to: proper learning to understand the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of the method; proper non-grasping attitude; compassionate rather than self-obsessed approach; appropriate pace and intensity; more consistent application; supportive example and companionship; and so on....</p>
