  <h1>What does your sleep-wake regimen look like? Are most of you early risers?</h1>

<p>Sometimes we assume that we can't wake up at a certain time because we know will be tired or sleepy through the day. But there's no universal law that says you can't go through a day, or two, being tired or sleepy. So for some aspirants, just realizing these assumptions or these secret deals one has with oneself can make all the difference.</p>
<p>That's not to say that you <em>must</em> wake up at a certain time, just that you should look closely at the things you say to yourself about it. "Well, I went to bed at midnight, so getting up early is impossible." Is that true? You are free. You can choose how to arrange your life. Although it may not be the only way, there's something to be said for getting up when you say you're getting up, and not allowing any argument about it.</p>
<p>I'm friends with one nun who sleeps maybe four hours a night, but is one of the clearest, most vibrant and energetic people I know. I know another monk who does all-night practice <em>every night</em> without fail, but is still out there in the day doing strenuous physical work and teaching and serving his community. These examples show us that we can question the assumptions we make about sleep.</p>
<p>What is important? That's the point. What do you want to achieve, and what does it take to achieve it?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Many negative patterns in life can be influenced or repaired by starting the day clearly. We tend to live our days the way we wake up. You might have noticed that. If somehow you wake up fresh and inspired, the day tends to move that way as well; but if you start the day by sleeping in too late, and overthinking your life while lying in bed, and blaming yourself, and resisting the feelings and activities that await you, then your day tends to be infused with those patterns of overthinking and resisting.</p>
<p>So starting the day very clear, doing simple beneficial activity right away before defeatist thoughts and fearful feelings can take root, can help your days go better.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In terms of attachments, it's important not to make attachments about the attachments. Character change comes from within, from the center. Imposing changes from the outside without an inner change of attitude and direction just puts pressure on your mind and heart, and your mind's thoughts and heart's emotions will soon rebel against that pressure and act out with even more indulgence or resistance.</p>
<p>So I would suggest looking into what inspires you. Why even consider waking early? Why even consider meditating? What is the aspiration, the great wish of your life that goes beyond mere temporary gains?</p>
<p>When you are actively working on something meaningful to you, that is a very powerful movement from within. Your center is expressing itself, radiating like a fire. This tends to leave less room for addictive behavior and self-doubt. And if you <em>totally</em> connect to your center and the movement that emerges from it, that radiance is like a sun that dispels all darkness.</p>
<p>So looking into your inner purpose is very valuable.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A great Zen Master said that our shared human sickness is anxiety with emptiness. Life is empty, all things are empty — there is nothing we can hold onto; everything comes from zero and returns to zero. But even though this is the truth of life, and even though this emptiness means all beautiful transformations are possible, still we are very anxious about it. We can't seem to just sit still and be with the emptiness. So all kinds of addictive behavior appears, in our attempt to fill or obscure the emptiness.</p>
<p>But when you are doing meaningful activity, you make friends with emptiness. Although the activity returns to zero with no graspable result, the activity itself is beneficial and joyous; and that is meaning enough. The meaning is not from the result, but from our sincere presence and participation. So I hope you try noble, beneficial activity like meditating, chanting, helping others, cleaning up your inner and outer environments, cleaning up your neighborhood and world. These will naturally fill the places that you would otherwise seek to fill with negative and addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Another point is that when we don't yet have a strong center we need to arrange the structures of our life to help us build one. Our routines need to be healthy and balanced; our eating, sleeping, and mental activity need to be regulated; the people we hang out with need to be positive influences; and so on. Once we have a strong center, then we can keep our balance and act beneficially in any situation and with any kind of people. But before then, when our center is still apt to get moved here and there by all kinds of pleasant and unpleasant influences, we need to control our life a bit from the outside.</p>
<p>Therefore, spending time with other practice people (like in a meditation group) and especially with awakened masters is very helpful. It is difficult to even conceive of the kinds of benefit you receive by being in contact with an awakened being and with other people sincerely seeking and practicing truth.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A lot of newcomers get too concerned about finding the perfect style or tradition or teacher. There are many very good styles, and many very good teachers. Also, every style and almost every teacher will have imperfections. What makes a situation good for you is that you actually <em>try, and keep trying</em>. For example, whether you have a chainsaw, an axe, a hatchet, or a knife, you can cut down a big tree if you keep trying. So it is your own sincere effort that makes a situation good.</p>
<p>American style can be good for Americans. But also Asian style or African style or other styles can be good for Americans. My teachers have been Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Indian, Hawaiian, Polish, American, Canadian.... Having things 'my style' makes certain things easier, but it makes it more difficult to overcome attachment to 'my style'. Encountering styles that are a bit uncomfortable brings new perspectives, interesting questions, and chances to practice confidence and autonomy in unfamiliar situations.</p>
<p>Finding a good fit may later become important, as you seek the practice that resonates with you the best. But for the first few years, just trying a practice deeply and consistently will be of extreme significance. Your original mind doesn't have 'American' or 'Chinese'; it doesn't have these kinds of limited views. Your practice is to keep the mind <em>before</em> limited views arise. Just put it all down and do the practice.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
