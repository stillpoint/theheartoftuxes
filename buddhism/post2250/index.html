  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This talk doesn't speak to Buddhist thought, but promotes (or rather has an axe to grind about) Confucian thought. It's more appropriate for r/Confucianism.</p>
<p>The thesis of this talk seems to vilify a lot of good teachings and practices, putting all 'western' approaches under one umbrella (insufficient, wrong), and ancient Chinese approaches under another (inevitably right). In many cases, the two are not actually that separate or that different.</p>
<p>Is self-acceptance not an essential part of the 'change' Puett (the speaker in the video) says the old philosophers championed? Is it not itself a positive change? What kind of positive change in one's relationship with the world could possibly come without awareness and integration of one's own thoughts and emotions?</p>
<p>Maybe the reason it's more of an issue in the contemporary West is that social alienation, disconnection from the body and emotions, lack of emotional intelligence, depression and anxiety, body-image issues, and many other forms of dysfunctional relationship with self <em>are so rampant!</em> The ancient Chinese philosophers may not have faced nearly the same kinds of issues, nor of similar severity. They could afford to skip over this territory, and it seems Puett takes this to mean they would contest it, as opposed to it just being somewhat of a non-issue for them.</p>
<p>Puett's assumption is not unlike the culture gap that appeared between modern Asian teachers and their western students until recently. In teaching "love all beings as your mother", for instance, masters arriving from the East had little notion of how much alienation and wounding appeared in students' relationships with their mothers. The kind and degree of emotional wounding among affluent, disaffected westerners still seems to catch some teachers by surprise. So no wonder that the old Chinese philosophers (from a simpler time, no less) would not speak so much to these problems.</p>
<p>While we're on it, what Puett calles "ancient Chinese philosophers" seem to amount to the Confucianists. If you know anything about ancient Chinese philosophers, you'll know that they hardly agreed with each other across the board. There was actually a lot of contention, to the point where various emperors would burn temples and kill adherents of whatever path fell into disfavor at the time.</p>
<p>Doing away with self-acceptance, or downplaying its importance, and on the contrary imposing oneself on one's environment, certainly doesn't seem to be a Taoist sentiment or even that much of a Buddhist one. Confucian teaching has been bastardized over the centuries into a shadow of Confucius' own noble contemplations, but even so its teachings of virtue and integrity must be based initially on integrity within oneself (self &gt; family &gt; society).</p>
<p>Puett is completely mistaken about the meaning of the 'natural' self; and he is disingenuous in saying that "most" Chinese philosophers would have a problem with the notion. (He is clearly enamored of Hsun Tzu, and presents him as the spokesperson for all China.) His idea of a natural self is merely a collection of habits and conditioning. Of course, if we think of <em>that</em> as the natural self to be honored, we may never move out of our current views and behaviors. <em>But that's not what the natural self is!</em> (Not to mention that Buddhism completely undercuts the notion of selfhood altogether!)</p>
<p>When we talk about the natural self, we mean the original, clear, unconditioned mind — the awakened principle within all beings. This absolutely <em>is</em> worthy of honoring, and it is far, far more functional, creative, and complete than any set of rules for behavior -- Confucian or otherwise -- could ever be. But those who are only fascinated with words and ideas, and who never get an actual experience of the original mind functioning in daily activity, are likely to make their own assumptions and dismiss it out of hand.</p>
<p>Yes, it is important for us to move on, to purify our negative qualities and work toward greater integrity and happiness. But to say that self-acceptance contradicts that process is a very naive view of self-acceptance. This is one of the most common misconceptions about Eastern spirituality in general: that accepting a situation equals 'going along with' or never moving on from it. That's not it at all, and Puett should know better. Accepting, in the wiser interpretation, means waking up to what's going on and recognizing its full reality, so that you <em>can</em> deal with it intelligently. It doesn't mean you become a dormant doormat; it means you experience reality openhandedly (in this case, your inner emotional reality), and then move on.</p>
<p>Yes, many mindfulness practices in the West are 'dumbed-down' from their original Eastern forms. But this video talk is a straw dog argument, taking issue with the weakest, most mistaken offerings.</p>
<p>This video not only fails to present Taoist and Buddhist thought in their proper light, it also does a disservice to both Confucianism and to the wealth of knowledge and wisdom available in our modern society.</p>
