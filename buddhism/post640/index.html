  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>You are very fortunate. These are good things to consider. It is very auspicious that you feel the weight of Samsara. This has been happening not just for 19 years, but for countless lifetimes: up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.... Around, around, around. You are right: It is tragic. It is heavy.</p>
<p>You are stuck in form. Welcome to the club! Me too. All of us here are stuck in form. So <em>some</em> kind of form will be necessary. If you abandon form prematurely, your form can't help you progress. You will still be in the same situation, attached and beset, but now without form that could help you and those around you.</p>
<p>So it is not the form that is the problem, but the direction. Does the form have correct <em>direction</em>?</p>
<p>Parent or student or lover or worker or monk â€” all of these forms are viable. If you have correct direction, any of these can lead to liberation. If you don't have and keep your correct direction, any of these can lead to the lowest hell realms of Samsara.</p>
<p>Do the environments and routines and relationships you're engaged with support your liberation? Do they encourage you to be yourself and find your true mind? That is the point.</p>
<p>"Who am I? What is my purpose in life? How can I help myself and my world?" These are the kinds of questions that clarify your direction. Find the influences that support this kind of investigation.</p>
<p>It is very common and understandable for people your age (and any age) to wonder where they belong, what they should do, what changes they should and shouldn't make, and so on. But actually, fretting about whether family or romance or monkhood is best is attachment to form. It is focusing on the thing that comes and goes rather than on the constant truth behind everything.</p>
<p>It is not that you shouldn't sometimes focus on these things and think them through; but it should be when the time is appropriate. When it's time to make a decision, consider it carefully, feel it clearly, and just do it. Don't go over and over the same territory.</p>
<p>When it's not time to make the decision, though, you need to let go of that fixation on the form of things. It is what keeps you in Samsara. Know your correct direction, and express it day to day, moment to moment. Then your life will unfold according to Dharma, not because you somehow masterfully controlled everything, but because every step you took was in accordance with sincerity, with truth; and thus truth became your life. Take care of this step, and the path unfolds in this step.</p>
<p>The path is not 'out there', okay? There is not a set way outside of you, waiting for you to discover it. That's a romantic notion upheld by novels and movies, but it's not Dharma. The path arises from your center, from within you. If you take a Samsaric step, Samsaric path appears. If you take a Dharmic step, Dharmic path appears. The aim is for our steps to be based upon our pure, clear, compassionate innate nature â€” our primordial mind.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of suffering: useless suffering and useful suffering. Useless suffering is everything that we try in life to get something for ourselves. Useful suffering means <em>practice</em>: taking on the effort and pain of spiritual practice, to gain the causes of liberation. Useless suffering goes around and around. Useful suffering has a lasting benefit. So suffering and regret are very, very good when experienced in the context of your correct direction. If you have your correct direction, you can turn suffering into wisdom, and regret into right action. You can perceive deeply the cause and effect of your life. You can feel deeply the <em>necessity</em> of getting the fuck out of Samsara. And you can feel just as deeply the <em>necessity</em> of helping all others get the fuck out of Samsara. All together.</p>
<p>No need for abandonment of others. But, yes, a need for the proper conditions for your unfolding. Sometimes you need to temporarily detach from relationships and situations in order to find the ones that support your progress the best. When your connection to your pure, clear, compassionate innate nature is not yet strong, you absolutely need to gather the proper conditions to help you â€” conditions that will support your proper view and behavior, that will encourage your liberative qualities rather than your self-centered ones. Foremost among these conditions is establishing a relationship with an awakened teacher. Others include clear living environment, clear relationships (and Dharma-based relationships), physical and mental health, even financial health. You need to be functional and self-sufficient; you need to have enough leisure to pursue spiritual training. (If you are always in turmoil or can't take care of yourself, there's little room in your life for practice.) Whether that spiritual practice is in a lay capacity or in a monastic capacity, we don't know. That lies in the misty future.</p>
<p>When, though continued practice, your connection to your innate nature strengthens, <em>then</em> you can go anywhere, do anything, and save all kinds of beings from suffering. You can not only be with family, you can be with <em>dyfunctional</em> family. You can not only be with friends and partners, you can be with <em>broken</em> friends and partners, without losing your own direction. That is called 'having Dharma energy' or 'having a strong center'. It comes with ongoing moment-to-moment practice. But before you've developed a strong center, you need to be very careful about the conditions that influence you, or you will lose the path and sink once again into Samsara.</p>
<p>What is the direction of the forms you engage with? What is <em>your</em> direction? One thing is at the center of life. If you keep this one thing always in your view, then even when old patterns swallow you up, you will not be lost. Then gradually the up and down will become less drastic and have less of a hold on you. Eventually the very forms of Samsara will be your vehicle for enlightenment and your way of helping all others.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>From what I read and feel in your post, I think you would connect very well with the practice of the <a href="http://www.tsoknyirinpoche.org/2575/web-teaching-i-2/">Four Thoughts</a> That <a href="http://www.rumtek.org/index.php/buddhism/turning-the-mind-toward-the-dharma/90-the-four-thoughts-that-turn-the-mind">Turn The Mind</a> (away from Samsara, toward Dharma). Practicing these daily, maybe first thing in the morning, would address the issues you've voiced as important to you (for example, maintaining the drive to do away with Samsara, without abandoning others). It is a practice that millions of laypeople as well as monks and nuns undertake.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here is another something to help you clarify your direction.
It is a famous old Zen poem called The Human Route:</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Coming empty-handed, going empty-handed â€” that is human.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>When you are born, where do you come from?</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>When you die, where do you go?</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>Life is like a floating cloud which appears.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>Death is like a floating cloud which disappears.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>The floating cloud itself originally does not exist.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>Life and death, coming and going, are also like that.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>But there is one thing which always remains clear.</em></p>
<p>&gt; <em>It is pure and clear, not depending on life and death.</em></p>
<p>&gt; .</p>
<p>&gt; <strong><em>Then what is the one pure and clear thing?</em></strong></p>
