  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>I make jokes like that all the time with my dharma friends. It does not impede our practice to do so.</em> </p>
<p>You believe it is so, and you say it is so, and that makes it your mode of operating. But it doesn't make it <em>so</em>.</p>
<p>When you become more committed to ongoing integrity you will care more about each moment of your life. You will take responsibility for everything you leave in the wake of your thoughts and actions. You will start to see what it takes to maintain clarity and correct relationship continuously from moment to moment, and you will notice what snide comments do to your mind on a more subtle level.</p>
<p>It's not that things <em>are</em> serious. Form is emptiness and emptiness is form. So no form needs to be exalted. But that comes <em>after</em> one has attained "form is emptiness and emptiness is form". The problem is that people, especially young men, latch onto the <em>idea</em> that form is meaninless without actually having attained the reality; and they use it to justify their character flaws: egotism, indulgence, laziness, arrogance. They apply their blithe attitude selectively.</p>
<p>They use 'taking it lightly' as their excuse for not maturing. The litmus test comes when it's time to show up: when they have to surrender to a form, or when they don't get what they want, or when their opinions or or attachments are questioned. <em>Then</em> we see how little ability they have to 'take it lightly'. We see how much they actually attach to form. For all the talk about keeping it fun, they are not able able to escape the very serious, violently defended death-grip of their ego.</p>
<p>The ones who <em>have</em> attained "form is emptiness" have a lightness to them that doesn't depend on frivolity or snide, self-superior remarks. They are very flexible: they can be relaxed, and they can follow form meticulously. There is freedom in their movement, and they don't need to comfort themselves by putting something else down. Unfortunately, a lot of people see this freedom and think that if they act with disregard it is the same as being a master... because 'nothing matters'. That is <em>not</em> the meaning of attainment.</p>
<p>Zen Master Dogen gave a teaching that absolutely hits the nail on the head here, pointing precisely to the dynamic in play:</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>They know that in the profane there is no sacred,  <br />
but they don't know that in the sacred there is no profane.</strong></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt; <em>What would do more to turn people off of Buddhism is being serious about it when your audience is trying to be entertained.</em></p>
<p>You also don't know that this is the case, you're imagining it to be so. You don't know whether frivolity may be more harmful than actually admitting that all of us share a yearning for meaning, for truth.</p>
<p>For instance, do you only ever do what makes your ego comfortable? Is that how you guide your life? If you do ever call yourself to a deeper meaning, regardless of whether the ego finds it entertaining, they you should know that mere entertainment is not necessarily what people need.</p>
<p>But even if it were the case, fine! Then don't be serious about it! Why assume that <em>taking it seriously</em> means you have to be serious about it? The mind attached to negligence makes that assumption; but it's not the case. The funniest, wildest, most spontaneous people I know are advanced practitioners and masters. If you've never trained with a 'crazy wisdom' master... their freedom from seriousness is on a whole other level. But they never lose Dharma, not even for a moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, someone who can <em>only</em> ever joke about things — whose sense of self-worth depends on making others laugh, or who habitually avoids anything meaningful — gets very tiring, very quickly. Boring and tedious.</p>
<p>It's like, a lot of people imagine their ideal partner to be bubbly, witty, playful; and when they meet someone like that they can be so excited about having a life with them. But if they find that it never turns off, and that there's no opportunity to share pain, sorrow, frustration, depth — if after a few weeks of living together they discover that their partner is basically a shallow clown, incapable of maturity — the fantasy comes crashing down. A lot of celebrities that we find charming for five minutes at a time would be hell to actually live with.</p>
<p>The reactions that people are having to what I wrote may say much about their own attachments. The ego wants what it wants. If they've built a dismissive, cavalier ego character, then of course they will bristle at anything that suggests they may have to give that up. "Fuck that, right? Nobody's going to drag <em>me</em> into maturity." As I said, it's very common especially among young men to go into spiritual practice with a sort of brash and carefree attitude. In the right context this can be used. Some degree of daring and iconoclasm, and even pride, are useful along the path. But this happens within close guidance from a master; for most, these qualities amount to immaturity, unconsciousness, and self-importance that will all have to be transformed or dismantled eventually.</p>
