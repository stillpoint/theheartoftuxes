  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Get proper Zen instruction from a Zen teacher. Don't try to figure out or invent the practice on your own. Then issues like this won't have a chance to expand into big misunderstandings and struggles.</p>
<p>If the Zen method focuses on an object (say, the breath or a mantra), only return to the object, and don't check or make thoughts about what else is going on. It's the power of returning that you're training. It's none of your business to try and arrange your mind state or other things that are happening.</p>
<p>In essence, you're practicing a very compassionate, mature, sane relationship with life: don't touch; let it be. When the weather is calm, let it be. When the weather is tumultuous, let it be.</p>
<p>Don't touch. Don't fiddle with your mind or the things that appear in it.</p>
<p>Have you ever been around a campfire with others or started one yourself? If you pay attention to what's happening, you can see what the fire needs for its life: you can nurture a spark into a flame by following it closely. But usually people only <em>want</em>. They want their big fire, <em>now</em>. They want control. They want to think of themselves as an expert, and be seen as a master woodsman. If you get a bunch of men around a fire they might even start vying for control and criticizing each other's failures, all becoming more desperate.</p>
<p>But then there's all this manipulation, and the fire itself isn't respected. Making moves to push one's own agenda blinds the person to what's actually happening.</p>
<p>But if you see an old hand -- someone who is really an expert at starting fires -- the approach is calm and efficient, not reactive, not desperate. One move, then let it be... wait... relax... maybe a little puff of air at the right time.</p>
<p>This is the attitude to bring into practice. Don't fixate on your fantasy of what's supposed to happen. Relax, settle down, and be very attentive to the spark and flame. That is, just take care of the moment. Keep bringing your attention back. Don't make desperate moves, rearranging all the branches; you'll just quash the fire and have to start again. Take care of just this moment by returning to the object of concentration.</p>
<p>In Zen, methods and instructions differ between schools. You can't mix and match. Each path and teacher has it's own integral course of training, it's own order and reasons that make sense in the greater context. <strong>Find one proper source and learn completely.</strong></p>
<p>In general, you return to the object but you don't shut out other experience. The world is allowed to be what it is. This is sane. This is compassionate. Don't impose your idea upon reality. Let it be.</p>
<p>Imagine a tribe or community where the boys and young men, with all their wild energy, are always getting into trouble and reacting to each other and fighting. But the grandfather is sitting quietly on his lawn or in front of his hut or teepee, just watching it all, smiling. He knows that this is all just part of how things unfold; it's part of the seasons of life. So he doesn't react, he doesn't try to control everything, he watches.</p>
<p>...And his watching actually provides a grounding, a spiritual center for the community. The 'watcher' starts to appear in the minds of the young men as well.</p>
<p>So two things for you:</p>
<p>First, you need to learn a proper method, and learn it properly. If you don't learn properly you will continue to have doubt. And if you don't apply the form meticulously, your own ego will run the show -- your preferences, habits, misconceptions, and blind spots will decide how you proceed.</p>
<p>Second, don't touch. Don't manipulate your mind, but only watch, with a very broad and welcoming heart. Don't check how much you're noticing. Don't check whether the mind is busy or calm. Don't congratulate yourself for perceived success and don't blame yourself for perceived failure. Don't judge or compare your situation at all. Be very momentary. Just tend to the spark in this moment, by returning completely to the method.</p>
<p>Don't try to make your experience 'deeper'. Only do it. This is a sane relationship with life. It's not the attitude that goes cutting down forests to get whatever it wants. It opens the hands and lets things be what they are and move as they move.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Next point: Zen training is a complete path. Only sitting meditation is just a small part of the path, and by itself can't transform your mind and energy and life. So again, get proper instruction from one proper, complete source of training.</p>
<p>Physical practice is a big part of the training, and is highly regarded in Zen and other practice traditions as a way of settling the mind, calming the energy, and digesting difficult life situations (and indeed all kinds of lessons). People who have the kinds of issues you mention do very well with prostrations practice and other physical practice. Check my posting history for many guiding comments on prostrations practice.</p>
<p>Lifestyle balance and ethical behavior are also extremely influential in calming (or agitating) the mind. If you are abusive to others or addictive in your behavior it's impossible to avoid the consequences in your meditation.</p>
