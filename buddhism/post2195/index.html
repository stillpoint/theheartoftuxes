  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Yes, let's not jump to negative conclusions.</p>
<p>So why don't you talk to the folks at whatever temple you're interested in, and see what's up?</p>
<p>Self-centered mindset is very thick, very heavy. It's not easy to just cast it off. As justified as you feel in your view, and as offended as you are when that view is even questioned — to that extent, selfish attachment is in effect. Do you see the irony in thinking someone who questions your approach is being pretentious, whereas you feel free to question and condemn a temple's pricing policy?</p>
<p>"But I'm just trying to learn here!" Yes, it's all about you. You getting your learning in your own favorite way trumps all other considerations.</p>
<p>It's not that your learning is not important. It's just that we don't know the rest of the situation. I'm interested to hear what you actually find out about it once you talk with the temple staff.</p>
<p>It's possible there is greed or some other corruption going on — maybe, maybe not; but we haven't heard that you've actually talked about the situation with the administrators. We haven't heard that you've given them the benefit of the doubt, and are seeking a mutually supportive arrangement. We only hear your complaint and indignation. So although it's possible that you may be justified in that mindset, no one knows whether that's the case; and if you haven't communicated with the administrators, even <em>you</em> don't know whether that's the case.</p>
<p>You seem to be lumping different situations together — three different centers, each with different types offerings. One is a Hindu temple. It's not clear why they should all be painted with the same brush.</p>
<p>It's also not clear what fee you're actually upset about. Is it $200 for a series, or $160? Is $40 a month an option? Are other options available? This all requires more clarity and more communication.</p>
<p>Among attachments, in our contemporary society few attachments are as deeply ingrained and prompt such violent reaction as the attachment to <em>money</em>. Many people will even share their lovers, but ask them to give over their money and you'll get quite a backlash. Of course, we all think we are fair-minded and justified in our self-protective reactions; but actually our mental state when it comes to money is not that different from a dog snarling over its bone when someone walks close.</p>
<p>Sometimes a firmly held boundary about fees is meant to bring that miserliness to light. Sometimes it awakens a student to what is valuable. Money is the barometer of value in our world now; and for many people it's only when you require them to pay a certain amount of money for an event that they take it seriously. I don't know how many times I've seen a student ask a temple or meditation center for a discount, then go spend the same amount on a dinner out or on some <em>other</em> class or event (I've seen it <em>many</em> times). I don't know how many times I've seen a student ask for a reduced price and then drop out (this too I've seen <em>many</em> times). To the student's mind, maybe "it just wasn't what I was looking for"; but from the outside perspective it starts to look like entitlement, and like they have a problem with commitment and responsibility — when required to show up in various ways (following a meditation form, coming to class regularly, paying set fees), they flake out. I'm not saying this is necessarily your mindset; I'm saying this is part of the landscape within which teachers and spiritual institutions operate.</p>
<p>Some teaching centers are softer on flaking out; some are harder. I don't think one way is necessarily worse than the other; they just provide different learning opportunities. For some people it is very good and supportive to be able to access teaching for free. And for some people having a boundary held, even if they don't like it, is <em>exactly</em> what they need in order to mature.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You might contact Zen Buddhist Temple - Ann Arbor. They have good practice and good teachers. There is a summer work-study program you can take advantage of. I believe they also offer weekly public services you can attend for free; so you can get a sense of their practice and participate in the community without having to let go of a penny.</p>
