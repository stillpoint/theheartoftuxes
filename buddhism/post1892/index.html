  <h1>5 Ways to Help victims of the Nepal Earthquake (opportunity for generosity!)</h1>

<p>That's maybe a topic for another thread. In any case, the understanding doesn't necessarily come instantly, nor only through the thinking, nor without a long-term effort of clearing out one's own assumptions and habitual ways of seeing and thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Did the Buddha teach that prayer could affect anything outside the mind?</em></p>
<p>What is outside the mind? There is nothing outside mind. In mind, there is no inside or outside, no self or other, no here or there. So many people have the notion that the mind is inside the head. Rather, the universe is inside the mind.</p>
<p>The mental training is to overcome the subject-object duality through which we habitually experience the world. From the perspective of ignorance (i.e., from a subject-object view), we think the training is about 'my' mind. From the awakened view, everything is included. So contrary to the teachings, people think that "I" "get" "enlightenment". It might be more accurate to say that the whole universe wakes up together; but someone stuck in the idea of separate selves would have a hard time grasping that statement.</p>
<p>The sutra widely considered to be the culmination of Buddhist teaching, the <em>Avatamsaka Sutra</em>, offers the image of Indra's Net, the web of interconnection between all things. It is visualized as an endless, multi-dimensional net with a jewel at each junction of strands. Every jewel both transmits and reflects images of every other jewel, including the transmitted and reflected images of jewels-within-jewels in infinite depth. This is said to indicate roughly the enlightened being's view of interdependence.</p>
<p>A group of practices common to every major branch of Buddhism, the <em>Brahmaviharas</em> (called "The Four Boundlessnesses" or "The Four Immeasurables"), is predicated on the knowledge of this interdependence, this intimacy with even infinitely far reaches of space. In these practices (the most famous of which is probably <em>Metta</em>/Lovingkindness practice), one's blessing is transmitted — radiated — boundlessly to all beings in all directions. All branches of Buddhism have these practices of boundless transmission of Love, Compassion, Equanimity, and Selfless Joy; and they are regarded as realities, not mere fantasies or baseless visions.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Mind is omnipresent. Here is a dramatic example of how it can function to save and care for beings:</p>
<p>When she was quite young, the girl who was to become Zen Master Dae Haeng evaded the Japanese forces occupying her country Korea, and ran from the abuse of her father, going out into the forest to live. During her years living in the wilds she spontaneously awakened to her inner guiding power, which she knows as the basis of mind (at the time, because of its warm and loving presence, she would call it 'Daddy'). The following is a biographical account of how this basis of mind would function to protect her even in the winter wilderness:</p>
<p>&gt;Although I collapsed near death dozens of times, I did not die. I did not starve to death, and did not freeze to death, and I was not hurt by animals. When I was near death, a thought would arise about where I should go to find what I needed. Once, when I was walking at night, suddenly I couldn't move my legs; it was as if they were frozen. When I looked around, I realized that I was just one step away from the edge of a cliff. Do you know what caused my legs to freeze up like that? Things like this happened so many times. I knew that this wasn't a coincidence.</p>
<p>&gt;...It was my true self who did all of these things. It was my true self who herded me toward dangerous situations, and it was also my true self who kept me from dying. I was never injured or harmed while living in the mountains and forests even though I was a small and weak woman. I survived like this for more than ten years, even though I never took food with me or prepared clothes for winter. It was all due to the power of <em>Juingong</em> [fundamental mind; literally 'empty doer'].</p>
<p>Here's what Zen Master Dae Haeng has to say about chants and prayers:</p>
<p>&gt;When those people who are one with their foundation chant sutras, the sound of their chanting permeates the entire universe and is heard by every Buddha and Bodhisattva. All things function together as one, so if you read sutras and chant mantras from this non-dual perspective, then true virtue and merit arises. However, if you don't know the deep meaning [of the basis of mind], your chanting doesn't reach the Dharma realm.</p>
<p>-<em>No River To Cross</em>, Zen Master Dae Haeng</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here is a teaching on the topic from Zen Master Sheng Yen:</p>
<p>&gt;Yes, Buddhists firmly believe in the efficacy of prayer. When someone prays, his faith engenders a mental state of supernormal, unified concentration, by which he can stimulate or arouse (gan) the compassionate vow-energy of the beings (such as Buddhas or Bodhisattvas) to whom he prays, and thereby receive a response. That is, the mental energy resulting from the supplicant’s concentration tallies and interacts with the energy of a Buddha’s or Bodhisattva’s vows. This interaction, in turn, gives rise to an inconceivable extraordinary power, which produces the special experiences and efficacious results of prayer.</p>
<p>&gt;In Chinese societies, where Mahayana practice prevails, praying to the Bodhisattva Guanyin (Sanskrit: Avalokiteshvara) [for example], brings about… miraculous results. However, a benevolent deity or spirit actually already protects a reverent devotee of the Three Jewels [Buddha, Dharma, Sangha]. If she suddenly encounters misfortune, even if she doesn’t pray at that very moment, her ill ‘luck’ [karma] will be averted, provided that she has firm faith. Prayer works because of firm conviction. If someone has unyielding faith, she is constantly under the protection of prayers.</p>
<p>&gt;Although Buddhists believe in the power of prayer, they do not emphasize that praying can solve every problem. For example, if a Buddhist becomes ill, prayer is very important, and if she has confidence, then in certain cases, through pious, sincere prayers she can induce a sympathetic response and be cured. Therefore, we find Buddhists scriptures mentioning cases of people being cured through expounding or hearing the Dharma. But if the sick person lacks conviction and experience in (successful results from) prayer, she should se a physician. So even during the time of the Sakyamuni Buddha, when a bhiksu became sick, he was normally treated with medicine. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Dharma is primarily for treating the spiritual illness of birth and death. For physical illness, one should use medicine. The ill should pray but also seek medical treatment: this is the view of an orthodox Buddhist.</p>
