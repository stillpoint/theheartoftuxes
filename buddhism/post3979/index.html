  <h1>Meditating on a Koan</h1>

<p>Each school that teaches koans may have a different approach, and it is important not to confuse the various teachings, or second-guess the process, or disrespect the teacher by going behind his or her back to check the instruction. Please use both perseverance and patience, and — if you trust the Zen Master — return to him for clarification.</p>
<p>You may have to return many times and practice for some months or years before you get clear on the method. This can be said to be part of the process. In Zen, you are taught to rely upon yourself, nothing else. Your own wisdom mind already solves every koan, and your own unknowing and effort already digest the situation. Even if you don't know, keep trying and you will find your way. The difficulty in connecting with the Master can thus be seen to be a great gift, a great benefit because it helps you to grow in your self-reliance and in your trust of Unknowing.</p>
<p>And Unknowing is precisely what works through a koan. You trade your opinions and habits and ideas for the deeper knowing that is already within you. It's an in-between state, a balance that you keep, which nurtures your growth in that particular koan, that particular aspect of life: you let go of conceptualizing, but you still put great effort into seeking out the meaning of the koan. You neither let go of the koan nor grasp at any object as a crutch or solution.</p>
<p>Our shared human sickness is our anxiety about emptiness, our discomfort with Unknowing. But this is exactly the place where we intentionally return in Zen practice, and in koan work. We keep returning to the place where nothing can be grasped. We don't put our trust in the illusion of thought. We don't invest our ego, our self-image in fantasies that we know something special. We simply open our hands and reside in that Unknowing.</p>
<p>If we practice this purely, then everything is allowed to be what it is, and to move as it moves. The whole universe appears clearly, and wisdom arises. And the koan also is allowed to function on its own, and soon resolves itself in your mind. It may come to you the same way as you automatically swat a mosquito when it lands on you; it may come to you as something that you didn't know you knew... but you now realize you always knew.</p>
<p>For example, when (as sometimes happens in life) you hurt someone with bad speech, a difficult situation arises. This is a koan, a situation that requires you to fulfill it. Your wisdom mind already knows what to do, but your family conditioning and the ideas and habits you've built up over the course of your life may cover it up. You may feel guilt, and then resentment, and then avoidance; you may think up strategies for coming out on top, for mitigating the damage or confusing the issue. But none of these are the correct fulfillment of the situation. If, however, you let go of all concepts and habits and manipulations, then all things return to their own correct place. Reconnecting with your sincere heart, you then can see what you always knew: "Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry to hurt you."</p>
<p>The correct fulfillment of the koan appears by itself when you give it the proper space. <em>You</em> don't make anything happen.</p>
<p>Occasionally in Rinzai Zen, the correct effort gets confused. Rinzai is very fiery, penetrating. Unknowing is sometimes seen as something to build up and make stronger. Some teachers will confuse concentration with strain. That's a stylistic difference, but it's also a mistake. Letting it be is enough. This is not true of Rinzai across the board, but if you encounter a teacher that insists on forcefully building doubt you will have to decide if that's a style you want to adopt. It is one way, but it is not necessary.</p>
<p>If you do choose to participate in a stressful, forceful building of doubt, it <em>can</em> very well clear conceptualization out of the way. It can also prompt many strange experiences, and this is from the pressure put on the psyche — there is no need to place any special importance on these experiences. So you can get something through this style, but also it is not the only way, and it is not strictly correct. You have to decide for yourself if it is "worth it" simply to study with a brightly shining Master, even if his method is not strictly correct.</p>
<p>The correct way to practice with koans is to return to Unknowing. The mind before thinking is spacious and clear; there the koan will resolve itself. It has already been seeded in your mind. Your mind is quite capable of processing it without any manipulation on your part.</p>
<p>Some methods will have you pursue active questioning by calling up the key phrase or issue in the koan and trying to find the answer. The question deepens and grows, and eventually opens to embrace all of life and every situation. The question becomes your intimacy with the moment. In any case, you should quickly reject any thought-based process. The koan's resolution is something you <em>see</em>, something you experience directly rather than figure out.</p>
<p>Other methods don't require you to keep regenerating a particular question, but rather simply keep un-grasping, not settling anywhere with your mind. The <em>hua t'ou</em> method that <em>tinybirch</em> mentioned is like this. <em>Hua t'ou</em> means "the head of speech". The words and concepts are the tail; before words and concepts is the head. So you just stay at the head, in Unknowing, without any other object or technique. This is my recommended method, but you shouldn't disregard the tremendous good fortune and benefit of studying with an awakened being, even if he/she may not teach this method.</p>
<p>Using the koan as a mantra is not right. It is not a mere phrase to be repeated; it is a deeply meaningful issue. Until you solve the koan, you live like a ghost in that part of your life. The whole world is full of these ghosts — <em>us</em> — as we drift, unfulfilled and disconnected with the source of life. But solving the koan, we then come alive in that facet of life, that part of our being. We start to become true humans.</p>
<p>Doing visualization with the koan is also not right. Mantra is mantra, visualization is visualization, and koan is koan. Don't mix the practices; they have different methods and effects.</p>
<p>If you have questioning, don't abandon it. But just don't make it a thinking questioning. Embrace and trust the questioning as something that is opening you rather than something stressful. Make friends with Unknowing, and don't try to pin it down. Then the koan will resolve itself, and you will eventually see "Oh, I already knew that!"</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A koan practice pro-tip: there's kind of a knack to koan work that lies in the direction of sincerity and simplicity. Be sincere rather than "wise", value simplicity and directness more than "understanding", and you will cut through many koans like a hot knife through butter. If you find yourself being sincere with nothing "happening", then just continue resting in open sincerity — continuously, faithfully. It will soon be resolved.</p>
