  <h1>Spontaneous satori experiences following a period of heavy LSD use</h1>

<p>The essential reality of your LSD-induced experience and the essential reality of your experience right now are the same. Sitting where you are sitting and reading this right now is an authentic experience.</p>
<p>But Satori, Nirvana, and Buddhahood are different matters. They are not experiences, but rather a radical overturning of experience. They are not something you get, but rather are revealed when 'you' and 'getting' have fallen away irrevocably.</p>
<p>I believe it is quite possible that you did, or at least that <em>one can</em>, come closer to reality and have significant glimpses of Buddhamind with LSD and some other drugs. LSD suppresses the activity of some aspects of the thinking mind, and so it can be seen as lifting some of the filters that negotiate our usual relationship with things. When those filters are lifted, certain things can be seen or felt more clearly.</p>
<p>If you got some greater insight and compassion, that's great; you're fortunate.</p>
<p>But it is also the case that with the lifting of filters the onslaught of undigested experience can overwhelm and shock the organism: part of the framework of intellect that keeps us on an even keel is also lost, and energetic and emotional upheavals can take over. Just because an experience is overwhelming, though, doesn't necessarily make it more true. How do you meet the moment? <em>That</em> is significant. Again, Satori is not an experience. It may be accompanied by similarly overwhelming experiences and onrushes of energy, but in itself it is of a different order, actually beyond relationship.</p>
<p>The other problem with LSD-induced insight is that the manner in which it is gained is not grounded in and supported by effort and gradual progress. It may seem like this is a good thing because you get something quickly; but without the supporting structure and experiences leading up to it there can be disorientation, doubt, lack of context, and a disappointing inability to maintain what was gained. Without the habit of practice, peak experiences most often fritter away; and that can be profoundly sad.</p>
<p>The rebound from an experience of boundlessness or selflessness will be more severe if you have not done the work of consciously and meticulously letting go, time and again. You haven't developed faith in its safety; so when you are suddenly thrust in and then back out a gut-level fear can easily overtake you and make it much more difficult to approach selflessness in the future. Maybe this is why you have experienced panic and nightmares.</p>
<p>We (our 'egos') think we are separate; so we makes ourselves into small beings amid a vast and strange universe. If we look at this with any depth at all it is of course terrifying to the small being. So the small being pumps itself up with dramas and thoughts of grandeur, and the small being distracts itself with stories and excursions of thought and strange self-conjured experiences. Be aware that the conjuring activity of the small self is an extremely strong habit, and that it continues automatically through even deep layers of consciousness. Don't believe everything you experience, and don't make ideas about it.</p>
<p>Reality is only overwhelming to the (imagined) small self. In actuality, it is very plain and simple. Boundless, yes. All-encompassing, yes. But this same boundlessness and all-encompassing nature is always with us — as we tie our shoes, as we go to the washroom, and as we surf the internet. The essential nature never changes. There is no need to believe more in dramatic experiences than in mundane ones. The key is to awaken fully to the present experience without grasping or pushing away.</p>
<p>This key is also the key to regaining your balance. Never mind figuring out what you got or didn't get; never mind building a philosophy about it. Never mind about what happened in the past or what is yet to come. Put it all down, and just engage simply and sincerely with what faces you. If you need relief from churning thoughts, drink a glass of cold water, wash your face, or enjoy some physical activity.</p>
<p>You already know how to behave; just follow the situation. When it is time to eat, you know what to do. When it is time to work, you know what to do. When it is time to help someone, you know what to do. And when it is time not to understand, you also know: just "I don't understand". Nothing extra is necessary. Don't make ideas like Nirvana versus regular existence. Only act simply and sincerely.</p>
<p>Please follow the situation without trying to get something different or keep something away. It's like letting a car straighten itself when you drive.</p>
