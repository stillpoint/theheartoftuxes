  <h1>I need sound advice.</h1>

<p>Real control means letting-be. Only fleeting, illusory control is possible through what we think of as the 'self'. Even kings can't control everything that happens in themselves or their domains. But if you unify with reality, that is true power.</p>
<p>Although the Buddhist path ultimately uproots the illusion of self that is behind all neuroses, if you want to cure certain psychological problems it is often much better to gain insight and transformation through psychological self-study or through work with a therapist or counselor. Buddhism is a cure in the broad sense, but you should go to the appropriate sources of help. For instance, if your car weren't working well Buddhism wouldn't help that much; you'd take your car to a mechanic, or take considerable time and effort to learn to fix it yourself.</p>
<p>Discipline isn't forcing yourself to do things. It's seeing. When you clearly see what has to be done, and why, then the appropriate action comes naturally. The necessary foundation for this is open awareness: you have to be aware in the present moment in order to wield 'discipline'.</p>
<p>If you are completely awake in the present moment, then you won't be subject to automatic modes of behavior. For instance, if you have a craving for cookies, going on automatic means that you just get a bag of cookies and start eating. But if you are aware in the moment, you can see your craving and how it is moving you, and you can choose to follow your craving or not follow it.</p>
<p>Sometimes this momentary ability to choose freely is called 'having a strong center'. When your center is weak, all kinds of circumstances move your mind around. You just get pulled around here and there. When your center is strong, it didn't matter what the outside circumstances are; you can maintain your course, you can keep your mind.</p>
<p>Strong center comes from correct meditation and mindfulness practice. Keeping a non-grasping, non-reactive mind from moment to moment makes you less and less apt to be controlled by outside things. Eventually you develop a mind that never attached to things: it sees clearly, it hears clearly, it thinks clearly, but sights and sounds and thoughts don't push it around.</p>
<p>So although it may not be a direct way of addressing your neurotic habits, certainly you can help yourself by keeping a moment-to-moment non-grasping mind. Just keeping your mind completely momentary is the same. Completely be in the moment, without thinking of past or future. This means you have to let things move as they move; you have to let things be what they are. You can't be in the moment if, for example, you try to hold on to a robin's song or a certain feeling in your body. So by letting go you return to the moment; and by completely being in the moment you let go.</p>
<p>You may need some training to grasp the meaning of this and to be able to apply it. A live teacher is best. Maybe you can find a meditation course or group near you.</p>
<p>Teeth-grinding and similar tics often comes from background anxiety. The underlying issues may be relatively easy to face, or they may be very difficult. It might be helpful to talk with a mental health professional. Most schools, and some hospitals and some workplaces, have free counselling available. Your community info line may also be able to provide a source for this kind of support.</p>
<p>If you just rest for a moment right now, without engaging in any of the tics, that will give you an idea of the kind of rest or letting-go that is required. Relax the body, let the breath move naturally, relax the mind, and just be neutral for a few seconds. This is possible.</p>
<p>What often happens is that a background anxiety lives in you, creating an almost constant tension. The body never completely rests; the shoulders may hunch, the belly may tighten... certainly, the jaw will clench. And mind tension goes along with that. The mind expects a problem, so it sets up defenses.</p>
<p>These are all control reactions. You try to control your experience with body tension and mind tension. When you think of it, your mouth and jaw are the absolute first control you ever have in your life, when as an infant you find your mother or your feeding bottle with your mouth. It is the same deep impulse to find comfort and control that comes through the mouth now. But what you need to find is not external; now you must find your inner contentment, your inner mother, in which everything is okay.</p>
<p>If you relax in a moment and return to neutrality, that is an expression of your original being, your innate contentment. At first you may think it's something foreign, but really it is your true nature, your inner mother. The more you return to it the more you can experience that it's okay to let go of the grip. You can trust any moment, because you and the world have the same mother. Resting in the moment helps you realize this. In fact, you can't realize it if you don't rest in the moment. Sometimes psychotherapy can help a person return to this kind of rest; sometimes they can do it themselves through meditation.</p>
<p>As you seek out the supports that can help you, whether that means a meditation group or a teacher or a counselor, you can at any time practice returning to a completely momentary mind. Just neutral in the moment, without expecting anything good or bad.</p>
<p>Can you find the moment? Your true life is there.</p>
