  <h1>What should I do?</h1>

<p>Even if we understand with our reason that the concepts of 'being a bad person' and 'trying to be a good person' are inaccurate and unhelpful, we are still deeply conditioned by cultures that have promoted those ideas. And really, most of the world's cultures have been involved in those ideas in some way. For example, Christian evengelical and fundamentalist views have permeated even many Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>Having grown up in those societies and learned our ways of interacting in them, we tend to carry some religious guilt and the conceptual filters of 'good versus bad', even if we yearn to move away from them.</p>
<p>Buddhism doesn't focus on good and bad, but on clarity. The categories of good and bad are seen merely as occasional useful contingencies, concise ways of pointing to cause and effect. If you do negative action, you get negative result; so for people at a very basic level of understanding (of cause and effect), the phrase "bad action" may be used as a teaching. But no action has an essentially good or bad nature; we only call it bad because it leads to results that don't help you or others to wake up and move beyond suffering.</p>
<p>Likewise, no action is inherently good; but we may label an action 'good' to point out that it leads to positive results on the path toward awakening and freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on the fight between illusory <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em>, we focus on getting clear. How can we align with reality?</p>
<p>You are right to consider "am I thinking too hard?" The right thinking is necessary, to distinguish between causes that lead out of suffering and causes that lead into it. But <em>before</em> thinking appears, you and everyone and all of reality are already complete, already okay. Thinking itself — making and holding concepts — makes a particular problem for us; it creates an illusory world, which blocks us from seeing what we really are. Attachment to thinking makes obscurations. What is obscured is our original pure, complete, and good nature.</p>
<p>This is the ground upon which practice and progress and attainment are founded in Buddhism: your original nature is already good. Before thinking appears, before the ideas of good and bad appear, already there is goodness. But it is a different goodness than the one that we think about: it has no opposite. Your original goodness is clear and bright and aware.</p>
<p>So this is what we depend upon, and what we keep returning to in the Buddhist lifestyle, commitment, and practice. Sometimes it is called 'going for refuge'. All Buddhists share the fact that they go to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha for refuge. At the basis of their lives, they entrust themselves to the awakened one, and the awakened teaching, and those who purely participate in the awakened teaching (those on the path to awakening). These are just different ways of saying that one trusts in one's innate goodness, one's innate awakening.</p>
<p>Because your innate nature is already there from the beginningless beginning, there is no way it can be made or destroyed. There is no combination of activities that will create it; and there is no character flaw that will destroy it. Therefore, there is essentially no 'being good' that will make you essentially better, and no 'being bad' that will make you essentially worse.</p>
<p>In view of this, there are two issues that need to be clarified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, how do you gain faith in your innate goodness, how do you begin to know it and have confidence in <em>it</em> rather than <em>ideas</em> like 'good' and 'bad'?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, how do you reveal your innate goodness? How do you stop the things that will cover it up, and purify the things that are already covering it up?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Faith in your own true nature is absolutely of primary concern. Whether you call it "believing in Buddha" or whether you call it "understanding your true mind", there eventually must come a confidence in the purity, luminance, awareness, and perfect responsiveness of your essential being, and by extension of the entire universe. Outside, we see these forms of self and universe; but inside, in the secret emptiness that all things come from, original nature shines brightly.</p>
<p>Our stagnant patterns of thinking and feeling and habitual relating obscure this original bright nature. The patterns all come from our shared concept of self, which is a big mistake. Because we make and hold this concept, who we really are gets covered up. We can't even see it. So a big part of Buddhist practice is involved in letting go of our attachment to thought. When you put down your thinking, then reality can speak for itself. Things can be the way they really are. The more you continue letting go of concepts, the more you align with reality, and the more confidence you can have in the essentially pure and perfect quality of reality. You can begin to function from the place <em>before</em> form, <em>before</em> thinking.</p>
<p>But even if you do the practice of letting go of thinking, old patterns are still at work in you, and the results of old actions are still arising. There is a lot of negative karma to be worked through. So lifestyle practice is also very important: to create causes leading to clarity and freedom from suffering; and to avoid causes leading to ignorance and suffering. The serious practitioner engages in not only ethical living, but also specific practices to perceive and purify their past actions. Gradually the material that would otherwise block out the original goodness dissipates, and new material is not made to replace it; therefore the original goodness shines brighter and brighter. One's wisdom and compassion emerge in one's every activity, at every level of consciousness.</p>
<p>Put down your thinking. Find a good 'putting down thinking' practice, and do it with faith in your essential completion and goodness. Also, learn about <em>karma</em> (cause-and-effect), and how your activities can either lead to suffering or happiness; then put that knowledge into practice.</p>
