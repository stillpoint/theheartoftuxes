  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This sounds like depression. But don't usher my word for it, and don't self-diagnose; rather get an expert perspective.</p>
<p>We often acknowledge on this forum that depression and other mental afflictions likely require other support and treatment besides meditation; and in fact, sometimes trying to push though meditation is inappropriate: it can cause more problems in terms of fighting with oneself, and it can distract from other changes that need to happen.</p>
<p>Gathering some allies may be helpful: health professionals, counselor, therapist, etc.</p>
<p>Aside from those important avenues of investigation, a few points can be addressed through other activities. Three of the major dynamics of depression are (1) avoidance of feeling and expression, (2) stagnation/lack of movement/avoidance of change, and (3) overthinking.</p>
<ol>
<li>Brahmavihara practice can be helpful; but if one habitually resists feeling, the practice can be sabotaged. Sometimes the remedy is a matter of realizing what's going on, redoubling one's efforts, and finding skillful approaches (i.e., getting better training). Sometimes the avoiding reaction can't be overcome by one's solitary effort -- it has developed and become entrenched for good reasons, such as self-protection during deficient or abusive upbringing -- and supportive helpers and therapies are required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other expressive activities may better sidestep the tendency to push oneself (which usually prompts an internal resistance in response to the pushing). Interest and enjoyment are your friends in this regard. Play and other spontaneous creativity can be very healing, as they invite you into the unstructured, unheld mind; they help you to trust the freedom and spontaneity that seem so daunting at other times.</p>
<p>I've written on this before; you can search my posting history. What might invite you into expression? Music and singing, acting, drawing and painting, and other expressive arts can help you connect to your heart and inner movements. Best of all arts for cultivating emotional intelligence, in my experience and affirmed in several recent studies, is free dance. By the way, excessive arts therapy, dance/movement therapy, and music therapy are viable options.</p>
<p>Journaling is another way many people get in touch with their inner life and help it to flow. However journaling runs the risk of strengthening the third aspect noted above -- overthinking, which is in evidence in your reply. If you try journaling you might set up some parameters to help avoid merely repeating and sinking into negative and hopeless thinking. Guidance from a journaling facilitator or a therapist who works with journaling can help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding lack of movement, the cure is to get moving. It is very simple, and often incredible effective. Sometimes just doing some yoga, dancing, or going for a bike ride can very quickly overturn stagnant and negative moods. The main thing is to apply the cure soon and often: when negative thought or resultant stagnation appear, get moving. I recommend whole-body-and-breath movement, because we tend to hide and resist by limiting some part of the body or breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might be useful to look into other fields of movement -- parts of life that might be stuck in a holding pattern, or downright sluggish -- like social movement or clinging to particular personas or daily activities without ever venturing into new territory. Is some adventure in order, some inspirational risk or challenge? Could you stand to expose yourself to new people, new views, new learning? Is it time for a career change?</p>
<ol>
<li>Overthinking causes a great deal of our suffering. From a certain perspective, wrong thinking is the cause of <em>all</em> suffering. Most problematic and insidious is the way we check our situation and condition. We become convinced that relief is a matter of figuring out what's wrong and figuring out a strategy; so we <em>think</em> more and more and more about how we're doing, and how we'll escape our situation, and where our problems lie. It's all very negative, and it all misses the point of just <em>being</em> in life. We devote so much mental energy to figuring out a way to escape our situations that we end up not living in them. It's a bad trade: exchanging real life for idealistic or negative thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p>So one of the best things we can do for ourselves is to become simple. And fighting to escape thoughts of escape is clearly problematic. So it's helpful to have either a simple practice or an interesting or enjoyable, healthy, positive activity we can throw ourselves into. Yet again, physical activity comes to the fore as a very helpful option. Get into the body and out of the head. Realize that the assessing and strategizing are not helping; they only exacerbate the habit of avoiding what's here in life and in your heart.</p>
<p>Notice how many times you refer to yourself and your situation in the comment above, and in your internal dialog. What can you go to as an alternative -- easily, automatically, without a second thought -- to get you out of your head and engaged in activity? Something that interests you already; or something you might like to try? Many people have little rituals for re-setting -- ways to shake off the buzz and get grounded. Sometimes it's literally shaking the whole body for half a minute, then diving into some clear action, whether it's work, home activity, or leisure.</p>
<p>Overthinking tends to happen in isolation. A great many meditators convince themselves that they're 'taking care of their practice' when in fact they are putting vast amounts of energy into thinking (about themselves). So progress is largely a matter of acquiring the proper conditions: clear teacher, consistent teaching (that can reach beyond one's other deep mental habits), practice community, health, clear and supportive relationships, financial security, balanced lifestyle rhythms (eating, sleeping, exercise, rest, sleep), spiritual friendship, and so on. Exposing oneself to new, <em>live</em> learning situations is especially important -- situations where there's real human example and real human interaction. Don't get stuck in one cramped, defensive self. These supports help control overthinking.</p>
<p>Spiritual seekers can tend to get stuck in a narrowing view of life, as they judge anything outside of formal practice to be less valid. But formal practice is intended to help us embrace life broadly and heartfully. Using spirituality to avoid human emotions and relationships is called Spiritual Bypassing. You might research that topic.</p>
<p>Best wishes, and keep moving!</p>
