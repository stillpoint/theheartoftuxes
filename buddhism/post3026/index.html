  <h1>Buddhism from Square One?</h1>

<p>Never mind about 'officially'. That's just the outside name and form. Take care of the inside, the center. That is always most important.</p>
<p>You don't learn on your own. This is not possible. It is fooling oneself to think that one learns on one's own. The world is full of benefactors and teachers, including human teachers, natural settings, man-made supports like shelters and bridges, relationships, work situations, and so on. There are written teachings, spoken teachings, unspoken teachings, felt teachings, and wiping-away teachings.</p>
<p>But we all start from a place of ignorance. Our habits and attachments and dullness and distraction are very thick, and control our minds and our lives. Even if by some very fortunate circumstance we stumble upon the Dharma, it is very difficult for us to accept it and assimilate it. The ignorance we have built up over years and lifetimes creates many obstacles.</p>
<p>Therefore it is necessary to rely upon beings and situations that hold the pure view for us, when otherwise we would fall into our selfish, indulgent, pleasure-seeking habit. At times when we are clear, we need to take advantage of that clarity to ensure our continued connection to Dharma.</p>
<p>That is why people go to a teacher, commit to study, join a practice group, support practice centers, give generously to Dharmic activities, and establish strong karmic ties to Dharma through heartfelt ceremonies like <em>going for refuge, taking the precepts, taking on samaya [vows and commitments], receiving empowerments, and doing retreats</em>.</p>
<p>You are correct that you shouldn't trust the internet to teach you Buddhism. There are many, many, many deluded voices on the internet. There are even many, many, many deluded <em>experts</em> — people who know a lot and can speak with a silver tongue, but don't have a basically clear and compassionate mind.</p>
<p>If you want to learn the Dharma and how it is integrated into human life, you need to go to a living human — someone who has <em>attained</em> it — to receive it and to see how it is embodied. This cuts away so much speculation. It leaps over pop culture images clichés, and goes to something deep and real and alive.</p>
<p>Just because you don't know how to find a teacher doesn't mean you shouldn't find a teacher! Find a teacher! Look. Look, and look some more. It is the most important relationship you will have, this relationship with the one who can bring you to your true being.</p>
<p>You don't have to know how things will go, how much you will be able to do, how frequently you can meet, how you will react, what will arise in your life, what you will attain or lose or take up or give up.... You don't need to know <em>any</em> of that. All you need to do is try sincerely.</p>
<p>The great Zen Master Dogen said that all you need to know is whether the practice is sincere. This is very important advice, and will serve you at every stage of the path, from beginner to master. Never mind checking how easy or hard it might be. Only try sincerely. That is enough.</p>
<p>When you try sincerely, that is already a mind of enlightenment. The destination is already present in the first step.</p>
<p>Do find a living teacher. If you can meet an awakened being one time in your life, it will be basis for inevitable awakening in a future life. If you give up the chance, perhaps thinking it is impossible or too difficult, it is like failing to take a step toward the clear stream when you are dying of thirst. You will only continue to die of thirst, and this dying of thirst goes on endlessly.</p>
<p>Next, don't think that you will get what you need by having your questions answered. That is a very common misconception, and one of the biggest mistakes in spiritual practice. Dealing with it from a merely conceptual viewpoint is keeping it at a distance. You have to become what you really are. You have to merge with reality. Answers from the outside can't get that for you.</p>
<p>But when you study with a teacher and group, the questions that appear along the way — the ones that have to do with actual present, real-life situations — will get addressed in many ways, each in its own time.</p>
<p>Beginners usually have the feeling that they need to make everything clear all at once. They try to be experts. But at the beginning, it is correct to be a beginner. Getting all the answers is bullshit. Don't trust that way. Trust your sincere trying. That means taking simple action. What can you do to express the Dharma? Far better than getting ideas from a book is doing a good deed. Far better than having all the steps laid out in a plan is taking your own steps into the unknown. The unknown is your new life; the known is your old life.</p>
<p>In general, it's not possible to choose a path just by hearing an analysis, or even by performing an expert analysis yourself. That is not how the path appears. It's not like there is a path out there and you have to find it and then make yourself walk it. <em>You</em> make the path. In a moment of sincerity and clarity, that is one moment of the path. String some of those moments together, and your path appears. But even when you are not sincere and clear, you are unfolding the path somehow. It's just a matter of what you are making in any particular moment.</p>
<p>What are you making? Wanting and grasping at knowledge? Take your time. Keep your aspiration; don't dawdle; but don't assume that it can all be taken care of in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>What is necessary is traditionally set out in the Zen tradition as the Three Pillars of Great Faith, Great Doubt, and Great Determination (sometimes called Great Fiery Determination). "Great" doesn't mean forceful or intense. It is not a conditional word, like "bigger than". It means beyond the ego, beyond self. So Great Faith means you start to develop a trust in your own essential awakened nature, your own original goodness. Great Doubt means you sincerely start to look into the question of life and death, with openmindedness rather than grasping. Great Determination means you only do it in the moment: just now, act; don't waver, don't grasp at forms and concept, but translate your issue into direct action.</p>
<p>When you do something in a way that you forget your "I, my, me" thinking, that is 'Great'. When you gaze at your loved one and forget yourself, that is Great. When you offer help immediately without even the slightest second thought, that is Great. When you work with others without trying to get something for yourself, that is Great. When you run or play tennis or sing or cook or sit so completely that there is only running or tennis or singing or cooking or sitting... <em>that</em> is Great.</p>
<p>All of these guiding words have the central point in common: only do it. Only do it, sincerely and wholeheartedly. That is most important. Other things are just outside things that come and go and depend on outside situations. This inside thing unfolds the whole path.</p>
