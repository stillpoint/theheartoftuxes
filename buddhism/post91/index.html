  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>The cause of suffering is craving. The mechanism of suffering is object-consciousness.</p>
<p>If you want some particular situation, already that causes suffering. If you attach to objects, that carries out suffering.</p>
<p>Your issue is extremely common among the general public, but even more so among 'creative' types. The crux of the matter is to express your creativity without requiring a special situation, and without attaching to the object of creation. That is why we say if you make <em>'my'</em> practice or <em>'my'</em> creativity, you have a problem.</p>
<p>Object consciousness means you have the illusion of a 'me' over here and an 'object' over there. Whether it's something you want to get, or something you want to avoid, or something that you think you've made, it's the idea of something as an object that is problematic. It keeps you separate from reality. So our human illusion is that we are separate, incomplete beings living among a collection of separate objects — the world as a collection of separate beings and things and events. This is all a mistaken assumption ingrained in our thinking.</p>
<p>Because we think of ourselves and the world as separate, we feel deeply that we are lacking. This moment is not enough for us as it is. Our being doesn't satisfy. We always have the sense that we need something else. It is the underlying assumption that we and the rest of the world are all separate that creates that deep sense of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>So letting go of object-consciousness is necessary. Meditation and other spiritual practice get at this point.</p>
<p>There are many creative spiritual practices that train you in letting go of object consciousness. Rather than aiming at getting something from the outside or producing some future result, they practice moment to moment integrity — unity between creator and created, non-separation of actor and action.</p>
<p>Actually, all true spiritual practice is extremely and magnificently creative. If you hold the illusion that you are a separate 'doer' and that something separate comes out of your efforts, you can fool yourself and pump up your ego about it, but by its very nature this attitude can't satisfy you. But when you let go of object-consciousness you actually return to your original complete state: the unmoving purity as well as the lush, constantly unfolding movement of all of life.</p>
<p>As Zen Master Dogen said, we don't sit as a person 'doing' meditation, we sit as the universe itself. This is not poetry! This is not far-fetched! It is your actual, real nature. When you get your illusions, assumptions, and habitual reactions out of the way, what is left is the vast and inconceivable unfolding of the universe.</p>
<p>So returning to your true self is tremendously, inconceivably creative. It's just that you must let go of the egocentric idea that 'you' are making something appear. This is letting go of the sort of God-complex that many artists and healers fall into — the delusion that the creative power comes <em>from</em> them rather than <em>through</em> them.</p>
<p>So the key for you is to find a training situation that keeps bringing you back to your center. Creativity flows and unfolds from the center. Keep your center, and let go of attachment to the 'outside' things. This is the key to your creative path.</p>
<p>If you find a teacher of acting, writing, or music who can teach this point unfailingly, that would be very wonderful and extremely rare. More likely you will have to find a teacher who points you back to your own center, not necessarily in connection to what we think of as creative arts, and then you can learn to apply that in your pursuits.</p>
<p>But it is vital that you always have your correct priority. Honoring the center always, always, always comes first. This is the very same as going for refuge: you vow and commit to taking refuge in the Buddha — taking refuge in original enlightenment — rather than any object. This is not a matter that can be compromised: you're either in or you're out. You're either about <em>true</em> creativity that unfolds from the center, or you're about object consciousness, trying to get satisfaction from that which is inherently unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Your happiness doesn't originally come from situations in which you express yourself. But expressing yourself does refer to the basic truth that everything unfolds from the center. When you express yourself, your center is functioning and things are flowing. There is movement to life, vitality. But many actors, writers, musicians, and other artists (who are in a way shamanic practitioners) <em>attach</em> to the milieu and result of their activity. This is where they fall down. Rather than giving glory to the great unknown source of creativity, they give glory to objects (or to themselves). The sometimes trance-like process of creating becomes an addiction rather than a liberation. It all hinges on openhandedness and ability to return to the clear center, the point of Unknowing at the center of your being.</p>
<p>So although in a sense it is practical to consider "how can I be content or happy?", in another sense it is a problematic question that points in the wrong direction. Rather than looking for what you <em>need</em>, focus on releasing need and returning to your center. Then your center can function and things can unfold in the correct direction, outward from the source. It's when the movement of things gets turned back toward oneself that suffering begins.</p>
