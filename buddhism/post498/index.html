  <h1>Is it true that, by default, whenever I am meditating, I am actually doing something the ego does not want? I feel like whenever I meditate I am fighting the ego, because one of the objectives of meditation is to dissolve the ego, or at least lower its "volume". Can someone explain?</h1>

<p>That which is commonly called 'ego' in meditation circles is the self-idea, the false sense of the existence of a self, and especially one's clinging to that idea. (This is somewhat distinct from the definition of ego derived from the field of psychology; so let's keep that in mind here.)</p>
<p>The ego -- the self-making, self-clinging mind -- wants most of all to live. That is its main activity: 'self'-preservation. It wants to prop itself up and assure its own security and control.</p>
<p>So the ego's influence is to always try to maintain a status quo where the sense of a self doing and experiencing everything is preserved. It wields this influence, of course, through the thinking. Thus there are identifiable patterns to this self-making mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ego tries to keep things the same. It hates change, wherein its safe dominance may be threatened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ego tries to keep things limited. It knows that boundlessness (also known as the Śunyata/emptiness that is known as the basis of Wisdom in Buddhism) means its certain doom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ego separates, creating walls and demarcations between experiences and beings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>·
 The ego can never be truly in love, for example, as love requires a unity that threatens its own existence. So ego-love will always regenerate the sense of self -- through self-aggrandizing thoughts, stories about how spectacular the experience is, clinging, worry, analysis, drama. It's soap-opera love rather than selfless, generous surrender.</p>
<p>There is no separate, continuing self; so there is no one object such as a soul. But if by 'soul' we mean the integrated movement of body, mind, and situation, then we can say that what the ego fears and hates, the soul loves. Moment-to-moment fluidity, boundlessness, and unity or interconnection are nourishment to the integral being, free from the dominance of the ego. More than mere nourishment, they reflect one's own true nature.</p>
<p>So yes, the rest and nourishment of meditation is recognized by the ego as its own death; so it will feel uncomfortable, and will resist. As we learn its patterns of resistance and attempts to regain control of the scenario, it will move to more subtle strategies. For example, at first it may just put forth a general discomfort; but when the meditator, through the power of her/his intelligence, continues to meditate regardless of discomfort, the ego may throw up any number of obstacles or enticements to reestablish itself as the controller.</p>
<p>'Special' experiences -- sensations, visions, insights, mind states, energetic manifestations -- will be dangled as bait, to get the meditator to stop dissolving into the practice and instead think in terms of a self that's doing or experiencing something. Sometimes the bait comes in the form of something that seems very important to analyze. These are very enticing options; the sense of <em>importance</em> or <em>urgency</em> is the ego's tool.</p>
<p>Even if a certain amount of progress is made in meditation, as one declines the baits proffered by the ego, in the moments and hours after meditation ego will try to wrest its control back. Thinking of oneself in any way is an ego strategy: “I'm becoming quite expert" is just as effective as “I suck" at generating a sense of self. How many times have we commented to ourselves or each other “That was a good (or bad) sitting" in the moments following meditation. The discursive, analyzing, checking habit is all in service of a built-up sense of self.</p>
<p>Sometimes the seeming last resort of ego, as control slips from its grasp, is to bring up a terror of losing selfhood or a seemingly reasonable concern about losing individuality or passion. These are common concerns among newcomers to meditation. But one doesn't have to worry about losing ego; it will keep coming back many times and in many guises!</p>
<p>Actually, the notion of self is not such a problem if one recognizes deeply that it is an illusion. One can then use the illusion, playing the game of life, so to speak.</p>
<p>In meditation, your intellect and your devotion are resources against the dominance of the ego. (I won't call them weapons, because the inner fight and sense of drama it entails play right into the hands of ego.) That is why it is very important -- critical -- to understand your correct direction in life, and what meditation has to do with it. It is not enough for this understanding to be theoretical; it has to transform the mind and heart, so one always knows where to turn -- if the ego's bait is not to be taken, then where does one turn, and why?</p>
<p>Correct direction is the basis of confidence in spiritual practice. You have to clarify for yourself the question “Why do this?" When your direction is clear, you will be able to decline and shun the self-generating, self-cherishing enticements and habits that arise. This then becomes freedom from distraction, which is concentration, calmness, and peace; it becomes freedom from illusion, which is wisdom; and it becomes freedom from self-centeredness, which is compassion.</p>
<p>If you encounter self-based difficulties in meditation, remember that they just exist on the surface. They are unreal, dreamlike. By far the greater part, and absolutely the more real and completely intimate part is your true nature, which is already perfect meditation. Perfect meditation is closer to you than any obstacle, because perfect meditation is already your own true mind, since before you were born.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Having a 'project' in meditation, such as the destruction of the ego, is ironically an ego-driven activity. In the grand attempt to uproot the self, the idea of an object to be uprooted, and of a self doing the uprooting, are strengthened. We must remember that although we talk of self (of 'ego') it is not a real thing. Merely don't engage in the illusion.</p>
<p>So trust is necessary. Open-handedness will do it, not you.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Throw yourself into the abode of Buddha</em></p>
<p>Only do it. Don't try to get, make, hold, or check anything.</p>
