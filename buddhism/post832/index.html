  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Not true. There are Soto koans, and sometimes Soto teachers teach with them. But the main focus in Soto is <em>shikantaza</em> â€” keeping the 'world-hitting' moment at all times, and letting it ripen and actualize in everyday life. This is what Soto encourages, and where their faithfulness rests. It is not essentially different from other Zen schools; just a different expression, a different outer appearance of the central point.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed in co-retreats that the same koans are passed in the same way by students of different schools. Insight is the same.  Truth is the same. But the style and quality may differ; and that's good, because it serves people with different needs and perspectives.</p>
<p>&gt;Emphasizing daily life practice as zazen, Soto Zen centers generally do not work with a set koan curriculum and method, though koans are studied and contemplated.  <br />
http://www.dharmanet.org/lczen.htm</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&gt;Even though Zazen is at the heart of Soto Zen, Soto Masters have never discarded the use of koans outside the practice of Zazen. Unlike the Rinzai koans that are very formal, Soto koans are more dynamic and sometimes represents the master's spontaneous answers to a question, instead of being a predetermined question or riddle. Everything can be a koan, not just a special question or a special phrase, but life itself.    </p>
<p>&gt;Practitioners of Soto Zen believed that Rinzai koans had become a formal technique. They thought that by putting too much emphasis on koans, the students of Rinzai Zen would be distracted by the urge to find an "answer" to the riddles by using mental faculties or the intellect, which, they believed, was opposed to the intuitive nature of Zen.  <br />
http://www.zen-buddhism.net/two-schools-of-zen/soto-zen.html</p>
<p>Zen Master Hung-chih Cheng-chueh wrote a book of koans traditionally used in Soto Zen, as well as in some other schools like Korean Soen.</p>
<p>I don't know what Hakuin encountered that made him so sour on Soto. It's often the case, for example, that students or break-off sects may misrepresent or fail to convey the true depth of their teacher's attainment and teaching; so it's quite possible that Hakuin encountered misunderstanding (perhaps coupled with defensiveness or bravado) and took to be representative of the whole school. Or that he was actually just criticizing a subset of the Soto school or certain teachers. <em>Or</em> maybe he just didn't get it.</p>
<p>Teachers may also sometimes be very set on <em>their</em> way, for the simple fact that it is what has brought them very real, undeniable results. And enlightenment has to do with seeing the nature of self; it doesn't always mean one's character has been perfected and all blind spots have been eradicated, or that cultural conditioning has been overcome. Anyone who has helped administer a Zen school (or almost any institution) knows, all kinds of social and political forces come to bear on the policies and communications that leaders put forth.</p>
<p>We also know how issues get dumbed-down over time in the public eye, and that far more complex and <em>reasonable</em> motives are often behind the simplistic headlines. We know from records, for example, that Hakuin also held Dogen in high esteem. I'd dare say that Hakuin might have railed just as strongly against lax or misguided factions in his own Rinzai lineage. But narrow-minded interpreters and our own laziness are to blame for the overly simplified and often altogether false dichotomies passed down (like the similarly superficial analysis of Theravada versus Mahayana). In real life, most masters get along just dandy.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear from someone knowledgeable about the history of this exchange/apparent conflict. For further exploration you might check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Zen-Became-Enlightenment-Song-Dynasty/dp/0824835085"><em>How Zen Became Zen</em></a> (which I haven't read).</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the review:  <br />
&gt;Although much of the book is devoted to illuminating the doctrinal and soteriological issues behind the enlightenment dispute, SchlÅ«tter makes the case that the dispute must be understood in the context of government policies toward Buddhism, economic factors, and social changes. He analyzes the remarkable ascent of Chan during the first centuries of the Song dynasty, when it became the dominant form of elite monastic Buddhism, and demonstrates that secular educated elites came to control the critical transmission from master to disciple ("procreation" as SchlÅ«tter terms it) in the Chan School.</p>
<p>Whether Hakuin encountered 'dead sitting' among Soto adherents of his time, I can say that certainly today there is much 'live sitting' to be found in all the major schools of Chan/Soen/Zen that I've encountered.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In my experience there are wonderful, clear, sincere people in all branches of Zen. The clearest practitioners don't harp on differences, and in fact don't get into philosophical debates â€” they're too busy actually practicing presence!</p>
<p>On the other hand, in my experience, there are some who are proud of their opinions, and who gather writings and sayings to support them in their view. These are the people who, year after year, tend to remain crusty and haughty. They don't seem to progress either in insight or in character. But we ought to bow to them as a 'good bad example', for showing us what we are in danger of becoming if we attach to views.</p>
<p>Among the various schools, masters are quite universal in agreeing that Zen lies beyond concept:  <br />
&gt;A special transmission outside the scriptures;  <br />
No dependence on words and letters;  <br />
Direct pointing to the mind of man;  <br />
Seeing into one's nature and attaining Buddhahood.  <br />
â€“ Bodhidharma</p>
<p>Action, not speech, makes the difference in Zen.</p>
