  <h1>Angry man spits on the Buddha. (Post from last year)</h1>

<p>The first point is that you, and the source from which you derived the quote, and the original speaker were <em>not</em> taking it for what it is, which is a piece of fiction. All along the path of its transmission, this has been presented as Buddha's speech, Buddha's teaching, rather than what it is: a made-up story.</p>
<p>The name 'Buddha' didn't even have to be included; it could just have been offered as a story that presents the speaker's (and your) point of view. But the name was included, presumably to pump up the sense of authority and authenticity, to inflate the story from a teaching based on its own merits to something couched in a respected tradition and a surrounded by a halo of truth and purity.</p>
<p>This deceit is the <em>opposite</em> of taking the writing for what it is.</p>
<p>Next, you think the story reflects quite well the teaching of no-self. But it doesn't. So this is a very good, real-life example of how misinformation gets spread and becomes misunderstanding, and how the Dharma becomes tainted and eroded by that process. How many people, because of this story, are now affirmed in their wrong view? And how many will they influence with it?</p>
<p>You hold a view that was supported by this supposed teaching of Buddha. If you take it on authority, your view can't come into clarity. The idea in the story was that there was nothing to apologize for or forgive because neither the offender nor the Buddha were the same person as before. There is a portion of truth to this, but it doesn't reflect Buddha's teaching. The moral of the story is nihilism, where nothing exists. Using the same logic we could say that a murderer no longer has responsibility for his action, because he is not the same person a moment after he has murdered. We could say that it doesn't matter what happens to victims, because they are already not the same people as the ones who were harmed. Although it is true that everything changes, it is not true that there is nothing that experiences continuity.</p>
<p>Therefore, as explained in the <a href="http://www.fakebuddhaquotes.com/the-man-who-spit-on-buddhas-face/">Fake Buddha Quotes link</a>, the Dharmic teaching of no-self is a middle way, between existence and non-existence.</p>
<p>The fact that there are people who preserve the Buddha's teaching means that this clarification, this wisdom is available to you. But the frequency and audacity not only of shallow or misunderstood teachings, but of outright fabrications, clouds the waters, confuses seekers, makes it more difficult to find and identify the true teaching, and suggests that the truth may be merely one viewpoint among many or that it is dependent on consensus or the loudest public voice.</p>
<p>The Dharma itself will always be pure, but it can very easily be clouded and lost <em>to us</em>. In our mutual ignorance we take trivial things as urgent, and important things as trivial. It is only because of our ignorant relationship to life — unaware of cause and effect, thinking that our actions don't matter, assuming that we will live forever and always have access to the abilities and knowledges we have access to now — that we are willing to be offhand about the teaching that can actually save us from ourselves. It's often not until we have a brush with death or experience a severe loss that we start to grow up and realize what is actually valuable.</p>
<p>And if you yourself don't see the harm, then it's all the more important for those who cherish the teaching to make sure it is presented clearly and truthfully. If someone can't see or doesn't care to see the influence of untruth and decadence, it's all the more important that measures be taken to preserve the truth.</p>
<p>It speaks to what you value. If someone were publicly spreading lies about you, one might guess that you'd feel some upset if not outright anger, and that you'd want the story put straight. If they were nasty lies made to seem believable, you'd feel that very urgently. So don't you want to take <em>at least</em> the same care with the precious jewel of Dharma? This is something that goes beyond you and me, it is a legacy for countless beings. So if you think "whatever..." and act in a cavalier manner about it, that reveals your relationship to Dharma and your future ability (or inability) to receive it.</p>
