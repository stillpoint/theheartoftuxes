  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Where do you think I say "It's all the same thing"?</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that. The <em>point</em> of non-doing is the same, whether it's couched in Buddhist language, Taoist language, or the language of a Midwest farmer. But Buddhism and Taoism have some very different aims, methods, and teachings.</p>
<p>There's no argument. There was just a misunderstanding of Wu Wei. You can research for yourself, but if you experience Wu Wei even once you can understand what I'm talking about. It is not about skill or knowledge.</p>
<p>Right now you think the quotes are vague and that they may or may not have to do with the concept because you don't yet get the concept (or rather the reality). If you get it, you will know very clearly whether a teaching has to do with it or not.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A good teacher wouldn't bite on your insistence for cititions and concepts. That is only contingent authority, not ultimate authority. If you attain a moment of Wu Wei you can access the real authority, which both Taoists and Buddhists have called 'the Way' (though the terms are also used quite differently in many cases). It's just a mistake to think of it as a <em>thing</em> that exists externally.</p>
<p>But I'll provide some more backing material for you:</p>
<p><strong><em>Tao Te Ching ch. 45</em></strong> <strong>(Stephen Mitchell trans.)</strong> Check the last stanza:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>True fullness seems empty, yet it is fully present.</em></p>
<p>¦</p>
<p>&gt;<em>True straightness seems crooked.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>True wisdom seems foolish.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>True art seems artless.</em></p>
<p>¦</p>
<p>&gt;<em>The Master allows things to happen.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>She shapes events as they come.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>She steps out of the way</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>and lets the Tao speak for itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>(D. C. Lau trans.)</strong>:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Great perfection seems chipped,</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Yet use will not wear it out;</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Great fullness seems empty,</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Yet use will not drain it;</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Great straightness seems bent;</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Great skill seems awkward;</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Great eloquence seems tongue-tied.</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here is the passage that Rks1157 was originally commenting on, from <strong><em>Chuang Tzu</em></strong>. Ironically, perhaps, our exchange here follows the original scenario, where one party can only conceive of Wu Wei as a kind of skill, and the other recognizes it as something quite beyond skill, as Cook Ding himself asserts:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee — zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou music.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>“Ah, this is marvelous!” said Lord Wen-hui. “Imagine skill reaching such heights!”</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, “What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now — now I go at it by spirit and don’t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and following things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>“A good cook changes his knife once a year — because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month — because he hacks. I’ve had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I’ve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there’s plenty of room — more than enough for the blade to play about it. That’s why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>“However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I’m doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until — flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.”</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>“Excellent!” said Lord Wen-hui. “I have heard the words of Cook Ting and learned how to care for life!”</em></p>
<p>If Cook Ding merely had skill, his knife would eventually dull. But in his activity there is no ox, no knife, no cutting.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the similarity of Cook Ding's description of his activity to Morihei Uyeshiba's (the founder of Aikido's) writings about his activity: when confronted with one or even several opponents, he would not see opponents, but would only be guided by the flow of <em>Ai Ki</em> (harmonizing <em>Ch'i</em> or energy). He would effortlessly gather up the various streams of movement and direct them 'where they wanted to go', then would stand in a moment of unmoving presence, surveying the fallen combatants all around him.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In terms of commentary, there will be a great deal of it on the point of skill versus Wu Wei, since it's central to Taoist teaching.</p>
<p>Here is <strong>Mantak Chia with Tao Huang</strong> in <strong><em>The Secret Teachings Of The Tao Te Ching</em></strong>:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>In the spontaneous expression of Te, there is no calculating mind. There is no conceptual mind standing back from the situation and observing, judging, commenting, claiming. Knowledge, to Lao Tzu, is mental information acquired by conscious desire or egoistic persuasion. Knowledge is something that can at times be useful, but the intellectual mind must serve its proper role, as a servant, not a master.</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here we have <strong>Brandon Toropov and Chad Hanson</strong> in <strong><em>The Complete Idiot's Guide To Taoism</em></strong>:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Again and again, when we approach the Tao and the idea of skill, we are guided gently back to the notion of remaining open to the influence of something vast that is already unfolding of its own accord.</em></p>
