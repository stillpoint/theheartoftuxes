  <h1>How to (or should I) convince my spouse that a reverend master is trustworthy? Also some trouble with motivation</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I'd like some help in understanding my boyfriend's fear</em></p>
<p>This is beautiful.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>…feel guilty that I have not managed to commit to the path in any real way yet</em></p>
<p>You are already committed to the path. You honor the Dharma, and you appreciate the teacher who shares it; you are willing and wanting to open you home to him; you are willing and wanting to understand your boyfriend's view and situation; you are concerned about protecting your progress along the path; you aspire to a greater level of commitment. All of these show that you are already committed. Now the question is how you can actualize that, how you can express your connection with Dharma in your behavior and daily activity.</p>
<p>All of us are incapable, and all of us lack knowledge and skill. Until we are Buddhas, we have flaws and failings, we carry wrong views and do bad action. But that is only one side, the side that is not real and essential. The other side is that our original mind already is capable, already has all knowledge and skill, already has correct view and action. This is the side that you have to have faith in, and increase. So when your mind turns to fears and thoughts of insufficiency your practice is to immediately be a lamp unto yourself — "No, I am a Buddha; my mind and Buddha's mind are the same. I now turn to my own true mind so I may become what I am."</p>
<p>Many acts of dropping wrong thought are necessary. Many, many repetitions of dropping the dark and picking up the light. In this life, we have already performed many millions of repetitions of wrong view and selfish motivation (not to mention our countless past lives); so we have to turn that around and be willing to perform many millions of repetitions of correct view (which means not holding any view, but putting it all down) and correct motivation (not "for me" but for all others, and ultimately just to express the Dharma itself). When you call on your willingness to drop it all and return, many millions of times, that willingness begins to shine. <em>You</em> make it shine by using it; no Reverend Master can do it for you.</p>
<p>Now this is very significant for you: the willingness to perform millions of repetitions is expressed in one single act. Never mind about the future. Never mind about whether you are up to it or whether the situation is conducive. Only do it this one time. This one time, this one situation and moment; this is all you need to concern yourself with. Only do it just now, and "millions" and "path" and "capable" and "Buddha" all take care of themselves.</p>
<p>So even in this situation, put down your wanting and only show up in the moment. It may very well be that at some point in the future your karma with your boyfriend will run out and you will each go your separate ways; but as of today, part of your practice is to show up for him, listen, show him care, and also speak your truth clearly and openly. I understand the desire to be close to your teachers; but you get close to your teacher by letting go of wanting, and returning to your own true mind. When you believe in your own true mind, then you are close to your teacher, okay?</p>
<p>Next, you ask about helping your motivation. Zen Master Dogen, who teachers at Shasta Abbey are sure to revere as an ancestor-teacher, said that the first condition of correct practice ("studying the way") is to arouse the <em>mind of enlightenment</em>. This is your original mind seeking itself. Elsewhere, it is called <em>bodhicitta</em>, and trained as absolute compassion for all beings, and great aspiration to live the path of awakening.</p>
<p>The <em>mind of enlightenment</em> is said to be the mind that is fully aware of impermanence. So you can arouse it by becoming more aware of impermanence. Consider that you can't hold on to anything in this life: your boyfriend, your home, your thoughts, and your Reverend Master will all be lost to you at some point. Furthermore, every situation, every day, is changing and changing. Also consider how valuable is the opportunity to study Dharma, and how easy it is to fall off the path. And finally, try to take to heart that you will soon die — it is only a matter of years, if not sooner. Your body, your feeling, and your thinking will all soon go away.</p>
<p>With that all in mind, the need to clarify your life comes into sharp focus. "I've lived this long, by some power not in my control, and I <em>still</em> don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to do here!" The mind of enlightenment brings this urgency with it. "I need to find out! I need to make something worthwhile of my life!" At the end of your life, all that stays with your mindstream are the impressions based on your good and bad actions, and whatever spiritual attainment you have gained.</p>
<p>If you want further guidance, it would be a good question to ask the visiting Master: how do I develop motivation? Just asking the question here, elsewhere, and of yourself, is already coming closer and closer to it.</p>
