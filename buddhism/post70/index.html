  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Hi, thank you for reaching out.</p>
<p>One dynamic we see very often in newcomers to Buddhism (or any other path) is their sense that they deserve complete explanation before they take a step themselves. Sorry to say, that's not how it works. Not because we wouldn't like to offer it, but because your own effort and experience are necessary for learning. Unless it's very shallow teaching, you're not going to grasp it all in one go. Wisdom requires time, effort, perseverance on your part. You have to get in there and get your feet wet.</p>
<p>In fact, many good teachers will limit what they teach at any one time, because if they give the student many concepts, the student will then tend to believe that the training is about concepts; but it's not. Just talking and talking tends to confirm the student's illusion that it can all be acquired 'from a distance', 'at arm's length'.</p>
<p>That may be how you acquire some theoretical knowledge, but it's not now you acquire something that's going to change your life and the way you perceive yourself and the world. Transformation requires your activity. You have to dip your toes in the water yourself, in order to truly understand the state of the water. And eventually, after appropriate steps, you have to release yourself to the water in order to swim. Just someone telling you what water is like is not the same as you dipping your toes, perceiving the water, and swimming.</p>
<p>So please be aware of how you hold onto your favorite opinion, and require Buddhism to fit into it. It may not fit! But in order to go beyond that and gain some of the vast wisdom and transformative effect of Buddhism, you have to be able to maintain a more open, let's say <em>scientific</em>, mind. To look with interest, with open listening, rather than saying "this is my idea; now show me how you fit into it."</p>
<p>A more even-minded approach is necessary. <em>Humility</em> is necessary. Not to become a puppet! But to become a vessel into which wisdom can enter. We maintain curiosity. We don't believe everything we hear, regardless of who it's from; but we also don't reject things simply because we don't yet understand them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Now onto your question....</p>
<p>This notion that you have to get rid of wants is the kind of thing that happens when people generalize and 'dumb-down' a much more subtle teaching. And the fact that teachings have been translated from foreign languages and cultures -- sometimes multiple times -- can add to the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, on the side of our culture and our assumptions, we can also make generalizations that aren't true. Is it the case that you can't have a meaningful life without wanting? Is wanting what really moves you, or do you just have a strong wanting <em>habit</em>?</p>
<p>Buddhism doesn't teach "wanting is bad"; it teaches the chain of cause and effect that comes from craving. So here are a couple of important distinctions. First, the difference between "such-and-such is bad" and "this causes that". In Buddhism, there is not really a 'good' and 'bad'; there's only growing awareness of <em>karma</em>: how the things we intend and do shape our lives. Occasionally the words good and bad may be used, but they will be short form for <em>karma</em>, or the results of our intentions and actions.</p>
<p>The second distinction here is between <em>wanting</em> and <em>craving</em>. Even "craving" is not a perfect, complete translation. Someone in the past just used that word and then others picked it up, and it became common usage. The original Pali word, <em>tanha</em>, means more like "craving <em>for</em>" or "trying to grasp".</p>
<p>So this is the kind of situation I was talking about above: if you want wisdom, you can't just react to words: "Oh, I love that; it must be true" or "I don't know, I don't like the sound of that; it must not be true." You have to offer some openness, some time to listen without forming or holding opinions.</p>
<p>If someone hears "craving" and then immediately concludes many things about Buddhism, that's their own mind making obstacles. If, on the other hand, they spend time with a teacher -- going to weekly class, or taking in many public talks, or living and training with them -- then they can receive <em>what the word points to</em>. "Ah, I see now that the word points to something more nuanced, more subtle."</p>
<p>Wanting or desire is like a life force that moves through us. It is not only not a problem, but it is what drives us toward unity, toward satisfaction and completion. In its pure expression, desire is our movement toward complete awakening; it is our own Buddha-mind emerging.</p>
<p>When it becomes a <em>problem</em> is when we create the illusion of a 'me' that 'has' the wanting, and an outer world toward which the wanting is aimed. This is called dualism, or object-consciousness. We make the mistake of assuming that we are small, separate, needy beings; and that what we need for our completion and happiness is 'out there' -- whether we conceive it as some possession that's going to make us happy, or some relationship that's going to fulfill us, or maybe if we're more clever than that we seek some kind of knowledge or recognition or power that we think will save us or make us happy.</p>
<p>The mistake is the illusion that we are small and separate, within a vast and hostile world of separate objects and beings. Because of this illusion, life's pure movement becomes dualistic: "I'm over here, and what (I think) I need is over there." Here is where we start to reach and grasp; and it is that reaching and grasping that becomes the cause of our suffering. Not only can we never hold onto anything in life (because everything is changing and impermanent), the very grasping itself perpetuates the illusion that we are separate, incomplete, and needy. It becomes an endless cycle of dissatisfaction. In Buddhism, this endless dissatisfaction is called <em>Samsara</em> -- suffering life that goes around, around, around, never leading to satisfaction.</p>
<p>If you ever actually practice Buddhism, your teachers may distinguish between <em>craving</em> which causes suffering, and a more complete and inclusive <em>aspiration</em>, which is desire that actually leads somewhere; it doesn't just keep you going around and around in the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said that all problems in the world come from not understanding who or what you really are. Nation fights nation; culture fights culture; religion fights religion. War, genocide, torture... Environmental devastation, pollution, waste... Corruption, crime.... Family strife, disconnection from loved ones, disconnection from oneself... Anxiety, depression, lack of meaning....</p>
<p>All of these problems come from not understanding our true self -- from object-consciousness rather than complete consciousness. We live in a cut-up world made of thoughts rather than the real, complete world. So in order to be happy, and in order to offer happiness and well-being to all others, it is necessary to understand your true self, end object-consciousness and grasping for illusory outside things, and gain real life.</p>
<p><em>How</em> you do it is the path of training and practice. If you see that it's worthwhile, you will devote yourself to it with patience, effort, and perseverance; you will dip your toes in the water, and eventual release yourself and swim. It is not possible from a distance; it is not possible from the armchair. You have to <em>do</em> it.   </p>
