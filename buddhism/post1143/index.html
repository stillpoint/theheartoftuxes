  <h1>Does practicing martial arts go against the Dhamma?</h1>

<p>Why do martial arts? That's the main question. As others have mentioned, your intent is central: Is the intent to help or to harm?</p>
<p>But let's be careful and meticulous about intent. Let's look into the issue honestly. You can say that your intent is to help, but that concept may not include others equally. You may adopt martial arts out of a fear and desire for self-protection that put you first and others second. You may say to yourself that your intentions are good (who ever thinks that their own intentions aren't good?), but all the while you may be envisioning the violence you will do to those who try to harm you.</p>
<p>I've done training in several different martial arts, with quite a few different teachers. Most schools and teachers give a nod to kindness, but it amounts to lip service. It plays out in a formal way, but often without much heart behind it. In my experience, character development in the martial arts world is usually connected to the martial training rather than to daily life. So you should know that you may not get a lot of support for keeping a pure, compassionate intent. The message may get mixed with other agendas like toughness, reputation, school pride, etc. Ask yourself how you know whether you will treat an attacker with the same compassion you offer to a friend.</p>
<p>But there are <em>some</em> schools where a bright, glowing feeling of â€œmutuality" -- of brotherhood -- is nurtured; and these are quite lovely and lively environments be in.</p>
<p>Some martial arts styles are based on the concept of peace. Peace is central to the practice of Aikido, for example, and there are some teachers who take the connection seriously. Even so, that message is very often perverted through the misunderstanding or poor effort of generations of teachers. The in-class or in-competition climates may not match the dogma put forth. You have to assess the actual behavior of the teachers and advanced students, not just the words they offer. (Beginning-to-intermediate students are generally not yet expected to be representatives of their school's code of conduct.)</p>
<p>Most martial arts teachers will expect you to put their teaching at the head of the line. That's quite reasonable, given the history of martial arts. Second-guessing your teacher or going behind his or her back to study with someone else is often seen as a threat to the integrity of the school and the livelihood of the teacher. But the â€œour school first" attitude often means that you will be hard-pressed to keep Dharma at the center of your life. So the next question -- and the question that needs to be revisited and re-affirmed throughout your career -- is whether your martial arts training is serving Dharma, or whether Dharma is taking a back seat to martial arts. For instance, some practitioners meditate in order to get better at their chosen martial art. That's putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>In terms of â€œdoing less harm", a dedicated practice <em>may</em> help one cause less harm to an attacker, but that option only really arises at the far end of training, at masterful levels of skill. Before then, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You learn how to attack vulnerable spots, but you don't necessarily have precise control that can be wielded in a crisis.</p>
<p>Self-defense was originally a very valid motive for the development and perfection of martial arts. Many of these practices arose in times of instability and violence, so it was a matter of either developing skill or suffering abuse or even dying. Along the way, some styles were developed largely for aggressive means, to get better at war, for example. And some styles merged with spiritual or religious traditions and became ways of life beyond mere skill. (The â€œ<em>do</em>" in arts like <em>judo</em> means â€œway", as in â€œway of life".) In most cases these days, it's fair expect a deeper wisdom from martial arts. Mere self-defense is no longer the most worthy goal; rather development of character and actual spiritual insight to the point where <em>victim</em> and <em>adversary</em> disappear are possible. But those who are able to teach it are rare.</p>
<p>Whatever your intent at the outset, it will be influenced by your experience in training. This can go either way: you may find that as you train your fear dissipates, so you may actually develop a more authentic compassion; or you may find that you get caught up in, and attached to, the exuberance and power you develop, or that revisiting attack scenarios time after time puts you into a defensive mode in your life.</p>
<p>If you clarify your direction, your intent, before you start looking for a martial arts teacher, you have a better chance of finding one who will actually help you in the Dharma -- <em>or</em> a better chance of making your experience into a Dharmic one through your own understanding and effort. Don't give this issue short shrift! Take care to look into it closely and honestly!</p>
<p>If you are very persistent or very fortunate you may find a teacher who is herself or himself a Dharma practitioner, perhaps even a Dharma master. I wish you good luck in this.</p>
<p>Also consider that true spiritual (non-martial-arts) masters are themselves warriors of another sort, and that training with them can also develop personal power and overturn fear -- in many cases in a much deeper way than can be achieved through martial arts. Take for example the smiling master Maha Ghoshananda, who leads peace walks through some of the most violent and war-torn territory on the planet. To see that radiant peace amid the violence is truly remarkable; his courage is transcendent.</p>
