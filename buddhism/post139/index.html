  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The reason you "always have stuff to do" is because of your mind. When your mind is more simple, your life will be more simple. It doesn't mean the external situation will go away (though it will be affected); it means you won't keep adding new complexities that weren't originally there, you won't keep regenerating new problems.</p>
<p>There's a tenet of work organization that says one hour of planning saves three hours of working. There's truth to this. You can get into a frenzy that makes you less and less efficient. You can focus so much on the little things that the little things start to swamp you. You can lose sight of what's important to you, and what's important that comes <em>through</em> you.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Even 5 minutes I can't get myself to do.</em></p>
<p>This is accurate. It's not that you're too busy; it's that you can't (don't) bring yourself to be not-busy. Busy-ness is exhausting; but it stimulates the ego, the doer; and the ego then grows and seeks more control, more doing, and fears the least bit of space and openness. <strong>It is the shared dilemma of countless seekers that the thing we need the most is also the thing we fear.</strong> We need and yearn for space; but we fear space. We crave openness; but we're anxious to be in it. We want rest; but we mistrust the surrender that's required to get it.</p>
<p>When the mind is racing with seemingly a million things to do, the prospect of space, openness, and rest seems not only unattainable but downright wrong. We are caught up in the <em>doing</em> habit that says everything must be solved by doing. Although by that point we already mistrust and feel uncomfortable about non-doing, ironically it is the medicine that we need most.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>reason is necessary</strong>. Right thought is necessary. You have to apply your understanding, and not just keep going along according to the habitual status quo.</p>
<p>And that is also why <strong>we use external structures to help us</strong>; because there will be many times when we can't think our way out of our own problems, many times when the veil has descended on us and we don't see the proper cure for our sickness. In our clearer moments, we then set up rituals, routines, commitments, supportive relationships, and lifestyle activities that help us find our way back even when we don't see the way.</p>
<p>So it's a bit like President Kennedy's speech, "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." We tend to wonder how to gather enough inspiration to get back to spiritual practice; but doing <strong>spiritual practice is what</strong> <strong><em>bestows</em></strong> <strong>the inspiration</strong>. When you do it — and do it for real, committing completely for the 2 or 5 minutes — the spark of inspiration is there. It is the very thing the ego-driven doing mind resists: space, openness, rest.</p>
<p>Next, it is very important to <strong>be clear on the</strong> <strong><em>why</em></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>how</em></strong> <strong>of the method</strong>. If you are unclear about what to do with your mind and body when thoughts arise, that will leave the way open for thoughts to take over the process; and meditation will then become more <em>doing</em>, more ego-driven activity looking for issues, checking results, and trying to manipulate states. So proper learning from a consistent and proper source is necessary; and revisiting the source of teaching frequently is also necessary to balance the veiling effect of all the doing and thinking in the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>When it's meditation time, let nothing else interfere</strong>. The notion that something else is more important, that there's something more urgent that needs to be figured out, is <em>false</em>. Don't let any thought whatsoever take you away from the method. Although all kinds of thoughts may take you away, every time you must gently and immediately drop them and return. As soon as you are aware of having gone on a train of thought, drop it and return. Not even the thought of Buddha should interfere with your method. Be a tiger, 100% intent on your prey. At sitting time, only do it.</p>
<p>It is completely reasonable to devote some small amount of time to Dharma. <strong>One tenth part study, and nine tenths parts practice</strong>. Visit, hear, or read the teaching for one minute; and put it into practice for nine minutes. Out of 24 hours, this is a very reasonable allotment. <em>Even if it interferes with your studies!</em> It doesn't — that's just the overactive, checking mind that thinks that way; but <em>even if it did</em>, it would be completely reasonable to devote some small time to the most important thing in life — your clarity and peace of mind. If that central point is not there, for what purpose is all the rest?</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>physical practice</strong> is very, very, very helpful in cases of overthinking. It not only counterbalances and grounds all that up-in-the-head energy, it is also very healthy and feels very good to get back into the body and get the body back into motion. You are a complete being, not just a brain. Your being needs communication between body, heart, mind, and world. So physical activity and physical spiritual practice is extremely beneficial on many levels, as a way of bringing forth that natural communication between parts of self. Physical practice like prostrations is highly regarded as a sort of 'emergency' method in dire cases, or when other practices are difficult or impossible to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Prostrations</strong>, for instance, can be done even when the mind is racing so much that sitting meditation becomes impossible. They quickly bring the mind and energy down, they increase circulation (which helps your mental acuity and stamina), they maintain leg and core strength and whole-body fitness, they improve digestion and elimination, and they prepare you for sitting. You can do prostrations as your main practice, but you might also find that you are much more open to sitting and much more able to sit after a few minutes of prostrations. If done quickly, 108 prostrations take about 10 minutes. You can do this first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up. Upon waking, rush to splash water on your face and brush your teeth, then do 27 or 54 or 81 or108 prostrations, have a sip of water, and sit for a couple of minutes. It will take just a few minutes, and <em>everything</em> will be better for it. The way you start your day tends to be the way your day goes; so if you start with something clear and grounding and Dharmic, everything in your life will benefit. Then in the evening or before bed, you can light a candle and do three prostrations, giving all troubles and concerns to Buddha. It is a completely reasonable schedule even for the busiest person (<em>especially</em> for the busiest person!) If necessary, wake up 5 or 10 minutes earlier. No problem!</p>
