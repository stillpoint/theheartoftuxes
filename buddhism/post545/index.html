  <h1>What's your favorite sutra?</h1>

<p>2Legit2Quit. Yes, if you see get the point of Dharma there's little reason to move away from it. The focus is on the way things really are, not on doctrine.</p>
<p>I wonder how you understand 'karma', though, as it is completely integral to the way things really are (and thus to the Buddha's teaching); it is how things move through cause and effect.</p>
<p>While one should not rely on foundless faith just because a teacher seems authoritative, relying solely on oneself and one's reasoning is also problematic; and the Buddha said as much. This is because we are starting from a place of ignorance: our wisdom mind is already covered up by all kinds of conditioning, preconceptions, assumptions, arrogant or shame-based attitudes, ingrained habits, and neuroses. Even in our best attempts at 'scientific' approach there are things we miss and mistake, simply because we start from within illusion. If we could see our illusion clearly, we would be free of it already; because we don't see it, we need the assistance of wise teachers.</p>
<p>This is not to say that any teacher should have the last word or should be followed without question; but once you have verified that a teacher has awakened to the true nature of mind and can convey it reliably, it is important to start letting go of the scepticism that often masquerades as critical thought.</p>
<p>The Kalama Sutta was a very minor, almost unkown sutra until it got blown out of proportion in recent times. It was aimed at a very specific audience, the lay residents of a crossroads town where many different teachers vied for attention. The Buddha was addressing that competitive and sometimes confusing landscape, noting the need for critical thought and investigation, but not putting them on a pedestal above faith in wise teachers.</p>
<p>The Buddha's teaching is quite a bit more subtle and mature than just saying you can find your own way. If <em>that</em> were true, a great many more people would be enlightened, as there are many sincere seekers, after all. But the way we see it playing out in reality is that those who connect with a good teacher and follow her or his guidance faithfully are almost invariably the ones who really transform their lives, and attain clarity, become deeply compassionate, and awaken to the dream of life.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from one of my past replies on the Kalama Sutta:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; <em>...I was under the impression that the Buddha said first to question everything...</em></p>
<p>&gt;That's a mistaken impression, likely based on the popularization and out-of-context oversimplification of the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html"><em>Kalama Sutta</em>,</a> a minor scripture that was practically off the radar for most Buddhists for many centuries, but which was taken out of context to champion the individualistic hopes of some people who want to think of themselves as Buddhist but resist giving up their own comfortable viewpoints and skepticism.</p>
<p>&gt;As you have noted so often happens on the internet, an obscure <em>sutta</em> has been repeatedly misquoted and used to support a dumbed-down but popular (go figure!) version of Buddhadharma.</p>
<p>&gt;The Buddha didn't say to question everything, not at all. He spoke in that <em>sutta</em> to a particular group of people, the Kalamas, who lived in a crossroads town where many teachers spouted with conviction many different teachings. So the Buddha told the Kalamas they shouldn't accept teachings based only on tradition or only on the reputation of a teacher; and if they know for themselves that a teaching is unworthy and unskillful they should abandon it.</p>
<p>&gt;But the Buddha also said that we should rely upon the wisdom of others who are truly wise, because for most of us the conclusions we draw based on our own logic are insufficient.</p>
<p>&gt;This is quite a different and more sophisticated teaching than the broad and simplistic "question everything". In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hindrances#Doubt_.28vicikicch.C4.81.29">doubt (failure to trust)</a> is pointed out as one of the Five Hindrances; i.e., one of the major obstacles to realization.</p>
<p>&gt;If you are thinking of learning and practicing Buddhism it's important to understand what is required in terms of your engagement with the teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;Keeping in mind that the Kalama Sutta was almost completely invisible to most Buddhists for millennia, here is an excerpt from it that offers better context:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' — then you should abandon them.</p>
<p>&gt;I hope you learn well when to question and when to put down your doubt. I hope you let go of all opinions, and start fresh and clean. Best wishes.</p>
