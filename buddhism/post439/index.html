  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>What concrete steps can be done to clarify direction when one is directionless?</em></p>
<p>Keep asking the question. "What is my correct direction? What is my life for?"</p>
<p>Every morning when I wake up, I piece together my body in awareness, and I consider: "Well, here this body is alive one more day, by some happy accident. Through no power of my own I'm the recipient of another morning of life. What is it <em>for</em>? How will I use it?" And I commit to Dharmic activity, to waking up for the sake of all others, not just in my fantasy but in actual effort and action.</p>
<p>Awareness of death is regarded as the foremost clarifying force in terms of life direction. We need to really <em>get</em> that we won't live forever. And it's something we need to intentionally face and embrace repeatedly. So a practice like The Four Thoughts That Turn The Mind (from Samsara toward Dharma) is a very good morning ritual, or integral part of morning practice.</p>
<p>I also can't say enough about having <em>living examples</em> of what it is to be a noble, beneficial, clear, compassionate, sincere human. When you are around a clear person fit even a short while, your own aspiration gets stoked. It can be life-changing. I recommend to anyone to seek out awakened teachers and sincere practitioners, and spend time with them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>All this doesn't mean there is only one way to express your true direction. Direction is a bit of a different issue from vocation, interest, etc. For some people, direction and vocation may come together (a person may become a nun or monk, for instance); but for many others, a tremendous variety of life paths may await. The issue is <em>how</em> you go about traveling your life path, what is the intention behind it. Is it self-centered, self-serving, and self-aggrandizing, or is it truly for the sake of others?</p>
<p>For instance, there are many ways you could travel in this world -- many vehicles, many routes. You can wear all kinds of different things; you can do backpacker style or jet-setting style. You can take on all kinds of different roles -- tourist, explorer, vacationer, professional, pilgrim. But the essential thing all of these ways share is that you have to be able to find your direction. You need to establish 'North' reliably.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of opinion or preference. It's a matter of accessing wisdom, which means putting down all concept, returning to 'zero'. When you can let go of all strategies and concepts in the flash of a moment, then you can always find your 'North', you can always return to things-as-they-are, rather than being pulled about by opinion and preference.</p>
<p>That zero point is also the point of compassion. It means letting go of self-centeredness and finding Great Direction. So when it is accessed it includes and engenders care for all others. We are free, at least for a moment, of our constricted, selfish drama, and can function for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>How can one reach spiritual maturity/integration and work through spiritual bypassing?</em></p>
<p>Gather the conditions supportive of awakening: teacher, community of people devoted to truth and compassion (not just in discussion but in practical daily activity), course of training, schedule, gradually increasing commitments and vows, clean and organized living space, clear relationships supportive of practice, health and lifestyle balance, ethical behavior.</p>
<p>These conditions can't be gathered all at once; so it takes patience and perseverance. This is where revisiting the truth of impermanence and re-establishing connection with correct direction are so important, so as not to wander away from the path for too long.</p>
<p>In terms of Spiritual Bypassing, again it's important to keep bringing oneself back to practice -- to keep looking into habits and flaws, and keep stepping into challenging learning situations. But it's also important to be steady about it, not rushed. Be careful with the idea of eliminating all problems in one fell swoop. Yes, there is always potential for awakening even within a day; but also practice unfolds over many, many lifetimes. If we imagine we're going to become perfect within a week or year, it's likely that Spiritual Bypassing is in effect.</p>
<p>Those sincere about transforming will commit to practice with a teacher and with clear form. Unclear or messy form is the domain of people who play at spirituality. They know that they'll always be able to hide or hedge. But those serious about practice are eager for their flaws to be exposed, so they can start to be free of them. They're fed up! Serious practitioners are eager to be called to high standards of behavior.</p>
<p>Some teachers are sharp and hard; some are soft and kind; some are deep and quiet; some are rollicking and gregarious. But the practice container, the reflection, the encouragement, and the insightful teaching provided by a teacher are indispensable.</p>
<p>Some regular shadow/bypassing therapy or practice, in concert with an external guide, could be helpful. Some people who have an ongoing and rigorous journaling or art practice find that a lot of bypassing issues get worked out that way. And for sure, being in any kind of committed relationship will bring those issues to the forefront, much more than solitary or itinerant life, where one can pick and choose and avoid being exposed.</p>
