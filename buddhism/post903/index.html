  <h1>Is there a place for confession in buddhism?</h1>

<p>I understand and relate to the fear of being rejected if you let down your guard and reveal yourself authentically. That comes to a head when it comes to responding spontaneously. The action that should flow through you naturally gets cut off before it even starts, with the overarching agenda to 'control the message'. It literally cuts off the flow of life. I think it's pretty clear, if we look, that this alternative to risking authenticity sucks.</p>
<p>Controlling the message neither helps us to be happy, nor does it lead people to respect and admire us. You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time; but even if you fool them into responding positively, it's not the authentic you they're responding to. And you know it. How sad!</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes more suffering to bring us to the point where we trust ourselves. Ideally, we would apply our clear seeing <em>before</em> suffering becomes the necessary result; but often enough, we have to really hate our condition and have it impressed deeply in us that our neurotic patterns aren't helping anything before we give them up and take a chance with authenticity. Sometimes it takes disaster before we start to wake up. It's really up to you: do it before suffering more, or suffer more until you can't stand it, and then do it.</p>
<p>In Vajrayana, this is represented by the ever more wrathful forms of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. The heart of compassion only responds, perfectly reflecting the situation. If you are willing to be awake to the harm you do, Avalokitesvara as the embodiment of compassion appears in very gentle and nurturing forms. If you resist the lesson, the compassion of the situation takes on a more forceful form. And if you reject openness and awareness altogether, very wrathful forms of compassion appear. This is just you making your own situation: you yourself determine how violent an experience you need before you wake up and turn around your mind and heart.</p>
<p>It could very well be depressing trying to teach kids. It would depend on the situation, the kids, and your approach. But the salient point right now is that your own thinking is making that depressive situation. You imagine it to be that way, so you also shut down the possibility of teaching kids in ways that <em>aren't</em> depressing. Because your mind is imagining a future, you aren't allowing doors to open in the present.</p>
<p>While it can be helpful to have a notion of all the possibilities, including negative ones, it's <em>not</em> helpful to allow negative possibility to become the pervasive, decisive reality. So returning to neutral in the present moment is very important. In that sense, repentance practice would be life-altering for you. Your ability to return to an unguarded neutrality is pivotal.</p>
<p>So it's not about a strategy that stretches out into the future. That, of course, can be part of your planning; but in terms of right or wrong approach, you have to be able to let go of mental and emotional involvement in an unreal future. Returning openhandedly to the present moment will allow you to connect with what's already moving through you.</p>
<p>You mention teaching kids, for example, so clearly there's something there that attracts you. Instead of trying to envision how things will go, you can connect with the authentic, spontaneous, <em>living</em> reality within you: Where is your interest? What do you love? What does your being respond to with energy and positivity? There's something already alive in you, to which you can awaken... in the present moment.</p>
<p>Prostrations in particular are an exceptional practice for returning to simple, grounded neutrality. After a number of prostrations, your whole body and breath and energy are in flow, your mind is more settled, and you are tired and ready to let go of holding. This is a very auspicious state, very fresh and open to possibility. The possibility is just not conceived as busy thoughts — but it's there by virtue of your settling down and not making anything.</p>
<p>When your own life structures are strong but not beneficial, it is almost always necessary to submit to some other external structure to bring you back to balance. That may mean submitting to a teacher, community, and course of practice; or it may mean submitting to a retreat or residential practice structure; or it may mean submitting to a facilitator and course of therapy, or some other helpful structure. Occasionally, for the very fortunate, submitting to a relationship with a very wise and grounded partner can be the thing that saves you. We've also heard sometimes that "having children saved me", because the person to a large extent gives up their own issues and opinions for the sake of the children. In the case of very strong or destructive patterns, submission to a rehab facility is necessary.</p>
<p>All this to say that the people, environments, and routines you surround yourself with are significant.</p>
<p>I hope your idea of success and failure can turn around, from something dependent on an imagined future, to a momentary authenticity. Can you consider it a success to be who you are and trust what moves through you?</p>
