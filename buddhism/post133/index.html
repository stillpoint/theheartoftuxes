  <h1>I need a little guidance. I can't be more involved in Buddhism because I'm paying off loans and working long hours, but feel myself drifting away from the path as time goes by.</h1>

<p>After writing this comment, I now think it is not for you, OP, but for others. I will re-engage with your question in another comment.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One gets overtaken by the mundane. The details of life and the struggle to survive, succeed, compete, comes to the forefront and drowns out the spiritual. If connection to the spiritual is strong, all of life can be integrated into it. If it is not yet strong, outside circumstances have a great deal more influence on you.</p>
<p>Therefore in these chaotic times, positive external structure is most helpful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a basic code of conduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>structural support in your schedule, relationships, and living/working spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>harmonizing with the situation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Code of conduct</strong> means not abandoning integral action when times get hard or unclear. (Don't think there's a time when you can practice the Buddhist precepts and a time when you can't.) There can be a tendency to give up, to say "it's too hard now, so I'll give myself a break and do better when I have the chance". But this is actually the compromise that drives the karmic cycle of suffering: If every time things get tough you begin to plant seeds of inattention, selfishness, aggression, or indulgence, those seeds inevitably ripen and create future difficulty.</p>
<p>So although you certainly should make an effort according to your capacity, and not exhaust or otherwise harm yourself, this should not be at the expense of integrity. You need to maintain ethical and compassionate awareness even in your everyday dealings, even in your struggles. Not because you'd be 'bad' if you didn't, but because it forms the causes for happiness and awakening.</p>
<p><strong>Structural support</strong> means you use the formations in your life to help you. If your center is not yet stable enough to maintain the Dharmic view independently, use your life's patterns to help. Sleeping well and eating well are very basic supports, the effects of which touch everything you try. If your basic energy is being supported, you feel strong in yourself and you have confidence to face difficulty. Difficulty becomes the thrill of living when your energy has a strong base. So eating supportive food and keeping a healthy sleep schedule are of benefit.</p>
<p>Your relationships should also bring you clarity, even-minded joy (rather than short-lived release), and noble-mindedness. When times are hard, your supportive connections can make a big difference; and just as important is cutting off or stepping away from trivial, negative, or tormenting relationships. Again, when you are strong you can be there compassionately for many people without losing your way; but if you lose your own connection to Dharma, how can you help anyone? Your own peace of mind is vitally important.</p>
<p>Next, your environment is influential. It is incredible to experience how a clean, orderly environment facilitates a sublime mind. Such huge parcels of energy are bound up in our possessions. If you keep your living space clear and clean, it will help turn your mind naturally to Dharma. If you can't arrange, in all the busy-ness, to keep your space completely orderly, start on one corner. Bring light and clarity to one small corner of your home and your life. Maybe that is where you can go to stay in touch with what you value most deeply.</p>
<p>You can also remove items that debase your mind - images of sex or violence, or perhaps more insidiously the sorts of cynical, sarcastic, and meaningless fodder found almost everywhere you look these days: gossip, memes, sensationalist news, pointless entertainment,  passive-aggressive speech, never-ending jokes, and so on. You can control their effect on your mind by removing their presence in your place of rest and refuge.</p>
<p>And on the other side, you can bring in either clear open space or images of freshness, peace, beauty, and kindness. If instead of seeing something stupid every time you lift your eyes from your work you were to see an image of the Buddha, or a live flower, or a beautiful circle or other piece of art, it would work on your psyche in a supportive way, sending positive messages constantly to your deep mind.</p>
<p><strong>Harmonizing with the situation</strong> means that when the way is clear you can move quickly and decisively; but when the way is murky or when your heart or mind is clouded, it is time to stay small in your activity: take care of the details and stay the course, in preparation for when things open up again. Everything turns around and around. When the onrush seems overwhelming you have to find your feet -- on this ground, in this moment -- and take care of the thing facing you just now.</p>
<p>So if you are not at leisure to spend hours meditation, your practice becomes taking care of the moment. With faith and devotion, every detail of life becomes your offering to the Dharma. Stepping onto the bus, figuring out your taxes, buying a broccoli -- these are the highest practice, if you are present with them.</p>
<p>Then because you have acted with integrity, a clear and strong foundation has been laid; so when the way opens you can move forward with tremendous, almost miraculous energy.</p>
<p>It takes a patient wisdom to know that things will come around, and to not mess up the detail work, the mundane, in-the-mud preparation.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Move with the times (i.e., with the changing situation) but keep contact with the spiritual foundation of your life.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It is your life. It is up to you to stay in touch with the Dharma, if that is what you deem important. Even if you don't devote a long time, keeping in touch every day will strengthen you. Consistency is very rewarding.</p>
<p>How you arise in the morning tends to shape your day. A conscious practice for a moment or a minute as you awaken can have lasting effect. As you shape your days, you shape your life; as your days go, so goes your life.</p>
<p>One practice is to <strong>embrace the Buddha</strong> upon first waking. As soon as you become conscious, even before opening your eyes, you can turn your mind and heart toward the uplifting, compassionate, enlightening aspect of the universe, and intentionally welcome it in. You can use your breath to receive the blessing of the day; you can open your arms in a hug and embrace the universal Buddha -- whatever is most meaningful to you.</p>
<p>Another possible waking practice is <strong>piecing the body together in awareness</strong>. Bring awareness to your hands, then add your feet, then move the awareness inward to include the limbs and then the whole body. You can spend maybe a minute or so bringing yourself into your body after drifting in sleep all night. The effect is to start from a place of stability, groundedness, presence -- as opposed to being taken over by the stream of thinking that appears. It makes the difference between starting the day as a conscious, embodied person, versus an automation or zombie, still controlled by the dream that has extended into daytime.</p>
<p>Piecing the body together is a quick practice that can be done also when settling in to sleep, or at any time when you want to be more embodied and stable.</p>
<p>Another very good morning practice as soon as you wake is <strong>morning vow and altar practice</strong>: immediately jump up and splash cold water on your face, then go to your altar or clear corner, light a candle, voice a vow to honor your awakened nature, and take a few conscious breaths. It is not fancy, but it is a complete and powerful practice: positive intention and positive action are both there, and Dharmic clarity is experienced in many ways in a short period of time: through touch (the cold water), vision (the light of the candle), archetypal action (lighting the candle), intention (feeling the sincere vow), voice (voicing the vow), and breath (taking the conscious breaths). The main thing is to be sincere.</p>
<p><strong>Offering candle light, incense, or clear water</strong> are traditional devotional practices that not only train the concentration in a very delightful way, but connect one's mind and heart deeply to the awakening and blessings of enlightened beings (which are the same awakening and blessings of your own true nature). If at any time you want to deepen your connection to Dharma you can do even a single act of offering. And any time you have the opportunity you can do dozens, hundreds, or thousands of offerings. In fact, you don't <em>need</em> the physical objects if you can visualize offering light, fragrance, or clear water to the enlightened ones, which means you can be making offerings standing in line at the store, or riding the subway, or sitting down to coffee.</p>
<p>These are all very good, profound practices that don't take much time. Do any or all, as you choose. You can spare five minutes in the morning. If you can't, then wake up five minutes earlier; it won't detract from your sleep, and it will gather great merit for you.</p>
