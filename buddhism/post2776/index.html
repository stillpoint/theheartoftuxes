  <h1>Any advice on sitting cross-legged?</h1>

<p>Sitting in lotus posture is physically and energetically ideal, both for the stability of the pose which allows the mind to settle without distraction from the body, and for the interconnection of left and right, top and bottom, which allows the energy to flow in a way that embraces the whole being. Having said that, the central point is that the <em>mind</em> is stable; the body is secondary.</p>
<p>If there is so much pain, awkwardness, or imbalance in the posture that the mind is repeatedly disturbed, it makes sense to back off to a more comfortable position until body and mind can become more stable.</p>
<p>Be aware that there are different kinds of "cross-legged" postures, and they have different psychophysical properties and produce subtly different moods. The "schoolboy" or "indian" cross-legged posture with shins crossed may put too much pressure on the shins; so it's usually only used for short sessions. It also tends to curve the back out too much, so is also only used where balance is not so important.</p>
<p>If you hope eventually to sit on a mat for long periods, some gradual training will be necessary. If the body is quite responsive, you can just take the desired posture and sit through considerable discomfort. Over time, the body may adjust. But for many (and perhaps for most westerners), forcing the body into those positions is inviting injury. Even if pain only arises after a few minutes, it may still indicate a position that the body is not yet ready to take. The knees especially are susceptible to long-term injury.</p>
<p>The best course in this case is a regimen that both stretches and strengthens the joints involved in sitting. The hips need to be flexible enough to rotate, so that the knees don't take that burden of rotation. (Knees are meant to bend straight, not be torqued sideways.) But there should also be enough tone in the hips to keep the head of the femur firmly in the hip joint.</p>
<p>The inner muscles of hip and lower back should also be both strong and flexible enough to naturally create a very slight inner curve when sitting. At first, a firm cushion or cushions can be stacked high enough to allow the knees to touch the mat while the lower back retains its slight natural inward curve. The lower back should neither collapse forward nor back. The triangular points of the pelvic sitbones should be vertical, supporting the upper body's weight just forward of their center. The sitbones and knees form a stable triangle, and the center of gravity (the lower belly) settles upon that stable base.</p>
<p>The upper back, shoulders, and neck can all benefit from training to strengthen them. Counterintuitively perhaps, strengthening the posture muscles tends to create a better alignment that then allows the muscles to relax. There is a certain tone that comes from the correct posture of both bodily structure and mind, which means neither tensed muscles nor sloppy collapse. You'll eventually find that correct concentration will, for example, keep your arms and hands in the meditation mudra without the need for muscular tension.</p>
<p>Certain forms of Hatha Yoga or Pilates may help open the hips and develop the posture muscles. The Korean practice of Sun Mu Do is specifically aimed at helping monks and nuns sit comfortably for long periods. Tai Qi, and especially the Zhan Zhuang standing practice of Qi Gong help train the posture of the upper body and the ability to settle the weight and self-dissolve tension.</p>
<p>Most meditative traditions combine sitting and walking practices; and others throw work and bowing into the mix as well. This shows the wisdom of tapering in slowly and taking a break when necessary. When the legs have become stiff or sore in sitting, be gentle and careful in standing up, and take a slow walk to bring circulation back to the legs before placing a demand on them.</p>
<p>Some meditation schools also allow sitting in a chair, changing sitting positions, and/or standing in meditation. As long as moving doesn't become a strategy for distracting yourself from your meditation you can simply change positions or stand until the pain has gone, and then return to the previous position.</p>
<p>Know the difference between a pain that is helping the body to adapt and a pain that is injuring the body. Don't count on teachers to tell you when you need to take care of yourself; they don't necessarily know what is happening in <em>your</em> body, and some of them may downplay the difficulty or risk involved for you.</p>
<p>A chair can be a good option. (I've used a chair nearly half the time during long retreats.) Choose a chair that is stable, that allows your feet to be firmly flat on the floor, and is of a height that allows for that natural curve to appear in your lower back. You should sit on the front part of the seat, without using the chair to support your back or arms. This allows you to find your own independence in your practice.</p>
<p>Legs "falling asleep" or becoming numb is often an issue. This is often caused or exacerbated by sitting too far back on a cushion. The edge of the cushion pushes into the back of the thigh and presses on nerves and vessels. Come forward so that the sit bones are near the front edge of the cushion. Many find that creating a slight slope in the cushion helps achieve both the proper forward-back position and the proper vertical angle of the hipbones. Some special cushions are made in a wedge shape for this purpose. Or you can stuff a short flat cushion under the back half of the sitting cushion to raise the back a bit.</p>
<p>Some say that over time and with deepening concentration the circulation of the legs improves and "legs falling asleep" is no longer a problem; but it has been an issue for me for many years, and I'm still in negotiation with it. In the short term, it's difficult to do significant damage to the legs, as the blood circulation doesn't really stop; rather, it's pressure on the nerves that causes the numbness or pins and needles feeling. Over the long term, I don't know what kind of difficulty one can run into if one has endured pressure, numbness, or pain over many years. I guess that's where each person has to decide for himself or herself what is most important and what is worth taking care of.</p>
<p>There's kind of a knack to finding a good sitting posture, and this involves having some knowledge and then letting it go and trusting the body to settle into position in its own way. The classic instruction offered by Zen Master Dogen is to sway back and forth and side to side once you have taken your sitting posture. Let the swaying find center for you. The bodymind finds its own right place, just as everything finds its own right place when you get out of the way and let it be.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Also, much of Thai Massage is aimed at assisting you in meditating for long periods.</p>
