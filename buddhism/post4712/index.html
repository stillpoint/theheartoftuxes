  <h1>How do you know you are in love?</h1>

<p>You don't necessarily ever "know you're in love". It's just a label people apply to certain feelings. The definition of that label is extremely vague and varies widely. Among a thousand people, you could easily get a thousand different opinions (or more likely vague ramblings) about what 'love' is.</p>
<p>So the first point is that you're seeking a label for your experience. The label is not important.</p>
<p>Next, when most people talk about love, they think it means a feeling. This is because people habitually and automatically attach very deeply to feelings. Therefore feelings control people and make them confused. Because people want only what they think of as good feelings, and want to avoid bad feelings at all costs, and numb out about neutral feelings, their reality is very skewed and their minds are always pulled here and there by feeling. So the average person can't use their mind to perceive clearly, because they are always moved and clouded by feelings.</p>
<p>(This is taught in the First Ennobling Truth of Buddhism, the Truth of Dukkha: attachment-to-feeling type of 'love' is the suffering of not being able to get what you want, not being able to avoid what you don't want, and not being able to hold onto anything that you do get.)</p>
<p>So that is the second point: most people think love is about feeling. What many people call 'love' is actually suffering, grasping at something that can't be grasped.</p>
<p>But that's not what true love is, not at all. Love is not 'for me'. Love moves only from your center, outward. It is not like a substance that turns back around and then you try to catch it and absorb more of it. If someone says "I want love", you can immediately identify the lie in that statement: "Hey! That's not love!"</p>
<p>If you see images of <a href="http://www.thangka-mandala.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Buddha-Maitreya-Thangka.jpg">Maitreya, the Bodhisattva of Great Love,</a> you can see this radiance. Maitreya only radiates love, always outward in all directions, to all beings everywhere. This is a good teaching about love; it only moves from your center, out.</p>
<p>There is a famous (not specifically Buddhist) saying associated with this lesson:</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt; <em>You can't get love, you can only be it.</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>If you wish greater clarity about the issue of love, you have to start discriminating between feelings, which you cling to, and your actual clear and open state of mind that extends to others. When you put everything down and rest in openhandedness, that is compassion. It is just ready, fully present and aware and ready to offer whatever is needed. When that clear and open readiness radiates, that is love. Compassion responds to pain and suffering. Love radiates openly.</p>
<p>So it is said that love is like the sun. The sun shines without discriminating. It doesn't choose its favorite people to shine on, it only does its job of shining.</p>
<p>Or love is like rain that falls equally on an entire landscape. Nothing is given more special treatment, and nothing is left out.</p>
<p>You have separate issues to clarify. The issue of "what is our true (or correct) relationship?" is different from "what is love?" You can always practice love, whether you are in a romantic relationship or not. Even if you are enemies with someone, you can still practice love and begin to overcome the antagonism.</p>
<p>Another separate issue is "how can I heal my emotional heart?" Yet another may be "what is our karma together, and what is the best way to use that karma?" These are all separate but related issues. Seeking to just label a relationship 'in love' or 'not in love' is a bit immature or simplistic. Once you label it, then what: no more complexity? no more unknowns? No, it doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>You do your best to keep correct relationship situation by situation, unfolding the relationship by showing up sincerely. Practice sincerity, sharing honest thoughts and feelings rather than <em>trying</em> to feel something or <em>trying</em> to appear as a certain type of partner. Often people put on a sort of mask, to try to be the partner they think the other wants, or to try being a certain kind of person just to try it out. That's okay, but then no one in the relationship knows what parts are real.</p>
<p>So moment-to-moment sincerity is necessary. It goes situation by situation, meeting by meeting, not by putting one blanket definition over the whole thing. Let it be complex when it is complex. Let it be simple when it is simple. Let yourself not understand when you don't understand. That is a good way to offer love.</p>
<p>As you show up situation by situation, naturally you will keep your mind from wandering to the future. Feelings and thoughts about past, future, and unreal present make your life into suffering. So practice love that is showing up openhandedly for what is real in the moment. Radically trust the truth of the moment to guide you. This is called "throwing yourself into the abode of Buddha."</p>
