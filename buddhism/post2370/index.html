  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Sexism is not really in Buddhism; it's in the minds and actions of <em>people</em>, and the cultures they create. Some people, products of the culture of their time and nation, have entrenched sexist roles and rules as if it were the reasonable thing to do. Some figures of authority have furthered sexism through fear of the feminine and clinging to power. Both men and women have been complicit in continuing sexist attitudes and customs.</p>
<p>Establishing correct relationship has to be carried out on two fronts, I think: social and personal. In the social sphere, we need education, advocacy, rewritten mission statements, reconstructed customs, and the like. But at the core this issue, as all so-called equality issues, arises from clinging to illusory self and fearing emptiness.</p>
<p>In the case of misogyny, fear of emptiness arises as fear of the feminine: the undefined, the intuitive, the sensitive, the changeable, the unknown, the dark fertile power. (We should note that the very essence of Perfect Unknowing Wisdom, <em>Prajnaparamita</em>, is ensconced in Buddhism as a feminine entity.) To truly overcome sexism we have to open to dark fertile power; we have to be okay with Unknowing, non-grasping, non-making. Without this basis, the ego's desire for control will continue to appear as negative masculinity: forcing form and opinion upon natural flow, and holding a deep grudge against dark Unknowing and its feminine manifestations.</p>
<p>If we understand the historic and cultural context in which (apparently) sexist rules and teachings were made, we might have a different view of them. In some cases, for instance, the rules were meant to protect women from harm within the broader (sexist) culture of the time; it's not so much that the rule or response was conceived in a sexist manner, but that it was trying to find a balance of personal safety, communal dignity, and preservation of Dharmic practice while <em>responding</em> to sexist culture. Other controversial decisions were no doubt the attempt to balance the needs of the individual with the needs of the community and the preservation of the teaching.</p>
<p>Of course, in many cases, sexism has simply been carried out and entrenched. Some great teachers have spoken out about this. But in other cases, feminine power has been recognized and embraced and revered. Note, for instance, the examples in Vajrayana of Yeshe Tsogyal, seen as equal to the 'Second Buddha' Padmasambhava; and Machig Labdron, who in addition to attaining multiple lineage transmissions also created her own lineage which is regarded as the sole meditative tradition originating from Tibet (the others having originated in India before coming to fruition in Tibet). Many other examples exist in all the major vehicles of Buddhism.</p>
<p>There are also the glowing examples of women who have not gained great historical recognition but that nonetheless have achieved rarefied spiritual heights. That they have not gained equal billing with the men of their eras may be due in part to cultural sexism, and in part due to the nature of their transmission. The Wise Woman Way has always functioned below the cultural/historic radar, outside established institutions, and conveyed more through oral and interpersonal communication than through writings and edicts.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the Buddha's hesitation in ordaining the first women who approached him about following the monastic path, and his comment that allowing women into the monastic order would hasten the degradation of the Dharma. Again, understanding the context is very necessary.</p>
<p>First, the women who first approached the Buddha were a Queen and women of the court, who had only known a life of ease and  entitlement. It is possible, if not likely, that the Buddha waited for them to prove their commitment because of this, not because of their gender.</p>
<p>Similarly, we should consider the possibility that the degradation of Dharma was foreseen not because of anything wrong with women, but because of what was wrong with the culture of the time and the inevitable repercussions and difficulties that female ordination would provoke. In fact, it could be seen as a sign of equality and radical feminism that the Buddha accepted female ordination <em>despite</em> what he foresaw, and went against the prevailing (Hindu) views of the time that definitely did place women in a subservient and spiritually inferior position to men. (Several writers have made the case for Buddha as the originator of global feminism.)</p>
<p>Because of our continued inner anxiety about the Great Feminine, and because of the deeply ingrained sexism of our culture, these issues will continue to appear in Buddhism as with all religions and institutions. It doesn't mean that Buddhism's essential nature is reflected by these wrongs; it means that we have to be aware and proactive, both in the social realm and in sincere personal introspection.</p>
<p>There are many Buddhist leaders and teachers who are advocating for equality. 'Enlightenment' in this field has not only gone hand-in-hand with modern feminism, but has in many cases led the way.</p>
<p>A few of the many sources to check out if you're interested in feminism and women in Buddhism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venerable Tenzin Palmo</li>
<li>Dhammananda Bikkhuni</li>
<li>Zen Master Joan Halifax</li>
<li>Rita Gross</li>
<li>Lama Tsultrim Allione (claimed by some to be the reincarnation of the aforementioned Machig Labdron)</li>
<li>Sandy Boucher</li>
</ul>
<p>But as others in this thread have mentioned, ultimately we have to get beyond the opposites-thinking of gender politics entirely. Neither woman nor man can attain enlightenment; enlightenment is beyond the separate self. Because of this, many teachers both male and female are quick to cut off protracted engagement with gender politics (teachings from Jetsun Khandro Rinpoche and Zen Master Seong Hyang come to mind). Basic equality must be recognized, but our aim is to go beyond all samsaric issues.</p>
<p>While the Buddhist <em>institutions</em> are not perfect, there have always been Buddhist leaders teaching and advocating for equality according to gender, class and caste, race, and sexual orientation.
