  <h1>How many years and what percentage of your discretionary income did it take you guys to build your wardrobes?</h1>

<p>When I overhauled my wardrobe years ago, I figure I spent $5,000 - $6,000 dollars, and it still clearly didn't fill all the gaps; there were still several pieces that I needed, which I picked up over time. Since then, I'll either occasionally shop for a single item that I know I want to buy, or about once a year I'll do a shopping blitz for a week or so, spending maybe $300 - $700 on a few basics and/or one or two statement pieces (like dress shoes or a coat).</p>
<p>When I do go shopping, more often than not I'm quite clear on what I'm looking for. I have it in my mind what piece I need, and in what color/pattern and style. (Though it's also often the case that something else catches my eye in the stores I visit.) I usually let the idea percolate for a month or two so I can take note of how many times in the course of my daily life I would actually have used the piece I'm intending to buy. I also do casual research, checking online catalogs and blogs for ideas on how the piece can be used (outfit combinations, and new ways I may not have considered). Even when I'm pretty sure that I want the piece, I nearly always buy from stores with a good return policy so I can bring the item home, try it with my current wardrobe, and return it if it's not quite right.</p>
<p>This process has helped me make my wardrobe more efficient in terms of combining. The core of my wardrobe is now very flexible; that is, many pieces can be worn with each other in many combinations. This comes from understanding the elements of style (color, pattern, texture, material, line, cut, design, fit, genre, level of formality) and especially from understanding myself, my lifestyle, and what I really want to express. The more I understand those points, the more focused my shopping can be. Before I understood those points well, I was spending much too much money on clothes that, while nice enough, didn't fit the bill. Only later would I discover "oh, this doesn't work" or "dang, this really isn't for me".</p>
<p>In fact, I'm still purging my wardrobe, trying to bring it to more focus. I'm looking forward to a central wardrobe that combines very well, plus a handful of standout pieces that I really enjoy wearing. I'm trying to be less egotistical in my approach. Rather than achieving the perfect image, my focus is on being true to myself and to the situation. Instead of being focused on getting more, I'm trying to focus on contentment. I find that I'm valuing simplicity at least as much as variety.</p>
<p>The upshot is that at times I am happy to wear the same or similar outfits frequently, <em>because they look good and they suit me</em>. When friends say that I look good and comfortable in my clothes, and that what I wear looks like 'me', it confirms that I'm hitting the mark. I would rather wear just a few outfits that look fantastic than many outfits that are only so-so; but the reality is that a core of well-chosen basics allows me to change my look easily with simple moves. Introducing an adventuresome color, or an interesting outer layer, or a unique accessory — these are very influential moves within a simple wardrobe, whereas they can lose their impact within a complex one.</p>
<p>In high school, I was clueless as to style and what it meant to be well-dressed. In university, I started experimenting with clothing, but the attempts were very crude and misguided. I'm still a beginner in many respects, just discovering what is possible. One of the big breakthroughs for me was just the willingness to express myself more — to try different colors and to try types of clothes I had never worn before — to get out of the rut. Mistakes were made, but they were essential to the learning process.</p>
<p>Developing knowledge of all the elements of style can be a long and gradual and ongoing process. But knowledge is not the same as developing the <em>eye</em> for style. My eye for style is utterly interwoven with my life experience, and can't be separated. It's all tied up in how I relate to the energies and movements of life: how I relate to design, cuisine, art, music... to my body and to bodies in general... to social interaction and the willingness and ability to express myself clearly. So in one sense, it is truly a life-long process; but some activities have been very effective in refining my style. Researching by reading and by studying many images of clothing design and outfits continues to be very educational. Developing a good relationship with good tailors has not only taught me a lot, it has (very gradually) brought my wardrobe to the point where I know that <em>everything</em> I choose to wear will fit well, no second thought necessary.</p>
<p>Maybe growing your sense of style is like the Pygmalion/My Fair Lady story: you might be able to raise your game significantly in a certain period of time with determined effort, but it will take more time for those skills and sensibilities to be digested and become your own.</p>
<p>I think by far the most effective thing you can do is to be curious and interested. That awakens your awareness and engages your senses. If you observe master chefs, you can see how interested, how passionate they are about food. They love to taste, they love to try; they may have a lot of knowledge, but their knowledge and heart move through the interface of flavor and the experience of eating. Similarly, your stylistic vitality can emerge through your sincere interest in those elements of style (line, color, pattern, material, etc.). Look at many images of outfits, consider what works and what doesn't (and why), try many different things.</p>
<p>And finally, understand what is and what isn't important about style. In the final analysis, it's all going to go away. Style is not the essential point. You are the essential point; style is only a tool. </p>
