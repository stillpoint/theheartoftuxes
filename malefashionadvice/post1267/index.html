  <h1>How well does this sweater go with this shirt?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>When I try to imagine those colors, it feels kinda off.</em></p>
<p>Well, that's important too. But until you are experienced and confident in that sense (and even then), it's always a good plan to check. Check the colors next to each other; check them next to your face; check the specific pieces next to each other; check the mirror; check in a photo.</p>
<p>Two great style tools are your bed or other large flat surface near your closet, and a full-length mirror with good (ideally natural) light. Many opportunities are lost by assuming something won't work — opportunities to wear something fantastic or interesting, and opportunities to learn something new. You may learn that, wow, these two colors have a very interesting quality together; or you may learn that your original sense of something "off" was accurate. And there are countless unexpected things you can learn along the way. Like, "brown" includes maybe hundreds of different hues in dozens of different perceivable shades and tints. You may know that in your thinking, but getting the experience of it in your senses and inner feeling is what develops your sense of style.</p>
<p>So you should try a lot of things. Trying combinations by laying pieces out on the bed is a quick and easy way to learn. It doesn't take much effort, so you can go through many combinations in a small amount of time. And the fact that it's easy may help your imagination and creativity emerge — you maybe won't care about failed combinations so much because you can just whisk them off the bed and try something else within seconds.</p>
<p>Then it's important to know how those combinations look <em>on you</em>, which is unique. You have a look and energy that is different from anyone else; so once you have a few possibilities to try, always check the mirror or take some pictures and look them over. Getting feedback from people experienced in style or visual arts can be informative too.</p>
<p>It's not about adopting one way of seeing things. It's about developing your knowledge, sensitivity, and awareness so that you can make purposeful decisions. Knowing the cause and effect relationship of things makes you into a sort of wizard: you can start controlling not only your look but your life.</p>
<p>If you want to develop a style sense, you should start with the basics. </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn what constitutes proper fit.</li>
<li>Learn the use of contrast</li>
<li>Learn color combining.</li>
<li>Learn pattern combining.</li>
<li>Become aware of different levels of formality.</li>
<li>Become aware of different genres of style.</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, build basic outfits: good fit, one or two neutrals plus a color and/or pattern, keep the accessories to a minimum, and keep all the pieces consistent in level of formality and style. Once you can use the basics, you can venture forth:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the properties of different fabrics?</li>
<li>What qualities do different colors convey?</li>
<li>What are the rhythmic and energetic qualities of various patterns?</li>
<li>How can you use texture, line, drape, and movement?</li>
<li>What are the cultural associations of various pieces (what cultural memories are you tapping into when you wear something)?</li>
</ul>
<p>And most vital: What do you want to put out there? What do you want to say with your clothing, your carriage, your activity, your speech, your life?</p>
<p>I am not very knowledgeable about fashion. There are many guys on MFA and elsewhere that know a <em>LOT</em> more than I do. I just count myself as lucky that I enjoy investigating, experimenting, and learning. I look at a magazine or catalog photo (of men <em>or</em> women) and try to figure out why all those decisions were made — why <em>this</em> was worn instead of <em>that</em>, why use this particular color, what's the effect of that accessory, how do certain pieces set the stage and certain pieces stand out, and so on....</p>
<p>Interest in life through the senses will help develop your style sense, because it is all movement and relationship. Energies and shapes intermingle and produce something new. Sometimes nature is the source, and sometimes humans create something that has never appeared before; and it is all very interesting how it unfolds and how we respond. That is the interface of style: you use energy to influence others; something unfolds through you, and the world responds in very specific ways.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A tip on the basics: the <em>neutrals</em> are earth tones like brown, khaki, tan, and olive, plus grey, navy and indigo blue, and sometimes white and black. (Black, especially, doesn't function as a neutral as often as many people think.) These are the colors that go with almost any other color, and can combine easily in most outfits. Knowing that these are the neutrals, you can use them as a springboard, building on the calm, solid foundation by adding color and pattern in the right proportion.</p>
<p>I agree with you that some specific hues of brown, particularly dark browns, may look very deep and rich with burgundy or may even clash. But brown in general is a neutral, so it's worth trying all kinds of colors with whatever brown items you have. Often the weird feeling you have about a possible color combination is an intuition about an energetic quality that can be used to great effect. No energy is good or bad in itself; it's how you use it within a situation that makes the difference. See if you can do some style Aikido and turn avoidance around, using unique energies in new ways.</p>
