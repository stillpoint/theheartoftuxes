  <h1>Throwing out half of the clothes in my closet. Please critique what's left.</h1>

<p><strong>1; 2; 3:</strong> Since the jackets aren't closed, it's hard to say whether they fit through the body. The arms, at least, of the first two are too long, and the shoulders seem to be a bit wide; so it leads me to suspect they may be a bit big overall. Shoulders and arms of the third look fine; so it may be your size overall.</p>
<p><strong>4; 5:</strong> Yes, the plaid jacket is very loud ('noisy'); and with the graphic tee, it's too much. Again, it's impossible to say whether it fits well since the jacket is open. The arms may be a tad long, but it may not be a big deal. If the jacket is tailored to follow a nice curve in the waist, then even when open it will have some better shape to it.</p>
<p>The white in the jacket is very bright; and together with charcoal and red stripes there's quite a lot of pop. If it's a keeper it should be worn mostly with solid neutral colors. Usually jeans are considered a neutral; but it so happens that blue is opposite to red, and when paired they cause each other to jump in intensity. Although it's not terrible (and the vibrancy is, I think, aimed at a bit of a brash, young look) it's something to be aware of. The jacket may be more palatable if worn with grey or brown pants.</p>
<p><strong>6; 7:</strong> Again, can't tell how either top fits because the jacket's open; but the shirt looks a bit loose. Jacket shoulders are too wide and arms are too long; so the jacket may be a size too big.</p>
<p>The red and blue together are too opposite and too intense. Just in terms of wardrobe options, the red polo in particular should only be in rotation with more muted neutrals, like <em>maybe</em> tan or mid-brown khakis. But I don't think that's a good color for you; and you might be better off letting that one go too.</p>
<p>You can indeed wear collared shirts under all kinds of jackets. Button-collar oxfords and polos will look best. Some crisp dress shirts and even some casual dress shirts like the striped one you show may look a bit 'stockboy' with a windbreaker. When buying a polo, try to get one with a collar that stands up a bit; the red one you're wearing has a collar that spreads out, which is more of an active-wear golf shirt, and not the best look.</p>
<p><strong>8; 9; 10:</strong> Both shirts are big around the body, the first one quite a bit too big. They can be taken in by an alterationist; but the first one may have too much to take in. The second at least seems to be your size in a 'classic' (loose) fit. If you tuck the shirt in and wear a belt, it may look better. Untucked shirts should have a very good, slim shape to them or they will just look messy and lame. The arms on both shirts are also wide and should be taken in. From what I can tell, the collar size seems to be okay; so now you can go ahead and open the top button or two.</p>
<p><strong>11:</strong> I think you may already know that the pullover is too big. The shoulder seams already reach the sides of your shoulders, whereas the correct fit would have the seams at the point (top corner) of your shoulders. The sleeves bunch <em>a lot</em> at the cuff; the hem bunches <em>a lot</em> at the bottom, and if allowed to fall would go past your zipper (correct fit is no farther than halfway down the zipper). The body has a lot of extra fabric at the sides. If you trace the outline of the pullover's shape on you you will see: there is extra material under the arm, then it buckles in, and then spreads out again a couple of times at the waist. If you can, return it and exchange for a size (or two?) smaller.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Is that your closet? I see a lot of black, stark white, grey, and a bit of red. Let me suggest toning down the contrast a bit (not as much white, maybe just a few softer white plain t-shirts and henleys as an under-layer; also only a few black pieces; and not pairing black with white unless its in a very slick and fairly formal context). Also, look at some browns and other <em>interesting</em>, not-primary colors; i.e., colors besides deep red and deep navy blue.</p>
<p>Start with some basic neutrals like khaki, tan, mid-brown, and olive. These will go well with all the colors you have. To bring in more color you'll have to discover which ones make you look great. In good daylight, try on a lot of different shirts, hoodies, etc., and see which colors make you look healthy and happy, and which make you look pale and worn-out. It's not about how the piece of clothing looks, or even how it looks on you; it's about how it makes <em>you</em> look. Once you have your basic neutrals, the addition of a couple of colorful pieces will really bring life into your wardrobe.</p>
<p>If you don't already have one, put up a full-length mirror where there's good light and room to move around. That is your number one tool for style. Try on all kinds of combinations and see for yourself what works and what doesn't, and <em>why</em>. An honest, well-dressed friend can also be a great help with feedback and suggestions; and if that friend is a girl, so much the better. And finally, use your bed as a canvas for trying out different combinations quickly without (at first) having to put them on and take them off. (But always check an outfit in the mirror eventually.)</p>
<p>You're heading in the right direction, thinking about fit and color and how it goes together. And it's a good move to get rid of any pieces that don't make you look <em>great</em>. Even if it leaves you with a much smaller wardrobe, it'll be one that will show you at your best. Once you learn a few more properties of matching you'll have skills that you can use to express yourself more articulately with your clothing.</p>
