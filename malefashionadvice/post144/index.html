  <h1>Do any of these work for a first date?</h1>

<p>You absolutely should not have a t-shirt or undershirt showing under your button-up. Not only does it look bad at the collar, but the dark tee likely shows through the shirt as well, which is not a good look.</p>
<p>If you require an undershirt, use a deep v-neck if you wear your button-up open at the neck, out a crew-neck if you wear a tie. White t-shirts are usually fine under colored button-ups, but you'll need a light grey our flesh tone under most white shirts to avoid having the contrast between the shirt and your skin show through.</p>
<p>When rolling up your shirt sleeves, make three flips of the cuff and push it above the elbow.</p>
<p>The very first thing you should consider in any outfit, especially for a first date, is how it fits the situation. What is the level of formality required, and what makes sense with your personal style and character? Unless you mingle in chic, sharply dressed circles, dress pants and a blazer or sport jacket are likely overkill.</p>
<p>The idea for a date is to be both comfortable and well groomed, while showing some of your character. You don't need to hit your date over the head with your attire, either in terms of formality or in terms of expressivity. Your clothes are part of a picture of integrity; they tell part of the story, the rest of which you will tell with your body language, conversation, and action. If everything makes sense together,a feeling of trust is engendered; but if you push too much to have your clothing say something that's really not your personal style, it will be uncomfortable for you and for others.</p>
<p>Unless there's a reason to go more formal (like, say, going to a very fancy restaurant or attending the opera) you may want to ditch the sportjacket or suit. Also, unless the sort of buttoned-down preppy look is your style, the cardigan is a bit stuffy, the v-neck more so. Do you have well-fitting dark-wash jeans? They're a safe bet, and around the level of sharpness you'd want for most dates. Or well fitting chinos. Comfortable, but clean-cut.</p>
<p>So first be yourself and <strong>be appropriate to the situation</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, the major elements of style you'll want to attend to first are <strong>fit</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong>. These are the factors that have the most impact after appropriateness. Color, pattern, layering, and so on can come next.</p>
<p>You'll often hear on MFA that <strong>fit is king</strong>; fit is the most important element of style. Whatever your body type, proper fit will make you look better. On the other hand, <em>poor</em> fit will make you look worse. The influence proper fit has on your overall look is big. You can wear essentially the same clothes and look either awkward or sharp merely based on how well the clothes fit you.</p>
<p>Check the sidebar for info on fit. That shirt is to loose on you. Get a slim fitting shirt, perhaps a softer oxford button-down collar shirt for its comfort, it's more casual sharpness, and because it can stand some wrinkling and still look good (as opposed to a broadcloth dress shirt that has to remain crisp). A slim-fit shirt may be good enough on you off the rack, but you may also do well to have it tailored so that it <strong>skims your body comfortably without either binding our billowing</strong>. An investment into one pair of pants and two shirts that fit well will, I believe, make a big difference in your wardrobe and in your self-image.</p>
<p>The sidebar info will also instruct you about proper fit of pants. You're young, so you can afford not to be so stuffy, conservative, formal. Find something more slim-fitting. You don't have to go skin-tight skinny.</p>
<p>Next, contrast. <strong>This is the most basic, impactful way to add interest to an outfit.</strong> It's the tonal first impression that people can see from a distance. When your upper and lower pieces are very similar colors and shades of darkness, it is a literally monotonous look. Some people can make use of subtle variations to create a very sophisticated monotone look, but without skill in matching it is a boring look, which will of course tend to suggest that the wearer is boring. The reason your plain shirt-and-pants picture looks better than the others is that there is some obvious contrast. The top is light, the bottom dark: some interest has been added, an interplay between top and bottom.</p>
<p>So after appropriateness and fit, consider contrast. You don't want to much contrast -- a black and white outfit would look disjointed, cutting parts off from each other -- but a difference in shades is helpful.</p>
<p>After the interplay has been added through contrast, if you add just one other harmonious element you get a <strong>three-way interplay</strong>, which is much more interesting yet. A casual jacket (like a Harrington or bomber) in a different color, either a different neutral like brown, tan, olive, or grey, or even a vivid contrasting color, would add another level of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Blues and browns are a natural match with each other.</strong> Add a piece in grey, or a similar blue or brown color with a pattern, and you already have a fairly sophisticated outfit that has integrity. With proper fit and appropriateness to the situation, a sense of being capable and self-possessed is conveyed without trying hard to look fancy or formal.</p>
<p>Let's talk <strong>shoes</strong>. Women see shoes and socks. A lot of men seen to think they're a non-issue, or that they're hidden down there, but women see them, and many women make a quick inventory based on shoes (and socks). Again, that doesn't have to mean shiny dress shoes, but it may mean that you have given thought to having <strong>something substantial or interesting as your visual and physical foundation</strong>. Whether they're desert boots that project casual comfort or work boots that project a bit of rugged masculinity, or slightly colored or otherwise interesting sneakers that show a spark of fun, shoes can say a lot at first glance.</p>
<p>When buying shoes, again consider appropriateness: what style and level of formality is most useful in your life? -- and consider contrast: how will the shoes create interest in combination with the pants you wear most often? Again, brown and blue are natural combos, so mid-brown to light caramel or tan shoes look great with dark jeans. If you want to show a bit of flair, red-brown leather, grey or olive suede, or a variety of colored canvas shoes can go great with a variety of outfits.</p>
<p>I suggest <strong>browsing the internet for images</strong> of guys dressed casually, but well. Unless there's reason for it, give up the image of a chic jet-setter and instead find your expression through the basic elements of appropriateness, fit, contrast, and then color and pattern. Be curious about what makes an outfit look good, and start a scrapbook or computer or phone file of favorite outfits. Soon you'll find your own style.</p>
