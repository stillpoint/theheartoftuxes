  <h1>The Problem with Dressing Nicely in "Real America"</h1>

<p>That's a perrenial 'culture clash' situation that can be difficult. These attitudes and behaviors are deeply entrenched generation after generation, and mutually encouraged within the community. It could be that you will never be able to change that pattern. If that turns out to be the case, the correct response is dignified disengagement. At least keep your own character clean.</p>
<p>The real issue is probably that the others feel uncomfortable. Can you change the message, then, from clothes to character? Sometimes pointed (not unkind) questions allow the other party to either (A) own up to their own discomfort or bad behavior or (B) consciously deny it (and hear themselves denying it). </p>
<p>While the first result is obviously preferable, the second can have benefit too. At the least, it will let them know that you see through their mocking and that you are willing to get real about the issue. It shouldn't be presented as a reactive, argumentative, or accusative statement; but rather with as much sincerity as you can muster.</p>
<p>I imagine something like: "Would it make you more comfortable if I dressed differently?" or "I know you're joking around, but I just want to check if you actually think that a man shouldn't care about dressing well". Whatever the actual dynamic is that you see in them, get them to either admit or deny it. That will immediately raise the consciousness around the issue.</p>
<p>You might also have opportunity to point out that <em>they</em>, not you, are fixated on collar stays and such. But then that would require you to <em>not</em> be fixated. So you need to let go of any judgment about how others around you dress, lest it be reflected back to you. Your interaction with your co-workers should be supportive, and aimed at the person rather than their clothing or mindset.</p>
<p>Laughing along with them might be hard to do, and might for quite a while encourage them to denigrate you more, but would also be an opportunity to practice letting go of your own ego and your own attachment to appearance. You bring into your life that which you make; so act with compassion and treat your co-workers as people, not focusing at all on what they wear. (Perhaps make a practice of complimenting what you actually appreciate about them.)</p>
<p>It also may be a bit late to get on that train, but it's important to act together with others, to let go of your own situation a bit and participate with others, doing what they like to do. It doesn't mean sinking to their level in terms of being petty and insulting, but it does mean showing that you don't think of yourself as superior, or as an outsider.</p>
<p>If you put yourself in their place, you can imagine that they could feel threatened by someone more knowledgeable and proficient about dress and style. They're only reflecting the other side of what they imagine you think: that they're clueless brutes. If you first establish your equality and human connection, then in the future you may be in position to offer support; i.e., to offer feedback and suggestions for how they might make some changes and feel better about how they dress.</p>
<p>If you just need something to get them to shut up, there's this: Some years ago I had longish hair, and a girlfriend suggested that a hairband would look good in it (it was a popular look in Latin Europe and South America). So one day I was riding the bus while wearing this hairband, and a group of teenagers started to laugh at me. I didn't react with resentment, but cheerfully let them know "Oh, this is really popular in Brazil". It was as if I was reminding them that there's a bigger world out there that they haven't seen much of. At least for a few minutes, they were questioning their own narrowmindedness instead of pointing at me. I think it was my confidence as much as anything that turned the tide.</p>
<p>I wonder if a statement like this might also be effective for you: "I realized pretty late that what I'm wearing doesn't fit in around here. It's what people wear in cities everywhere around North America, and it's what I happen to own. You <em>do</em> know that this is just considered dressing professionally elsewhere, right?"</p>
<p>Good luck. I'd be interested to hear how it goes.</p>
