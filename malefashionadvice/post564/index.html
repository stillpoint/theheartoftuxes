<p>title: MFA: Need some help trying to change my wardrobe
summary: 5.0

<hr />
<p>The first thing you'll want to do is an overview of your lifestyle, your body form and coloration, your image, and how the wardrobe you already own serves those points. What do you already have enough of, and what is missing? Where do you spend the most time, and doing what kinds of activity? From these questions you will determine what kind of purchases will have the greatest effect. Do you need clothing for out and about on the town, for school or work, for going out, for styling it in high society...?</p>
<p>Do a critical overview also of your body shape and skin coloration. What cuts and designs work for you? What are your best colors and what colors should you avoid? Cull your present wardrobe to eliminate colors and cuts that don't work for you, and also start to thin out the pieces that are just 'meh'. Aim at keeping only pieces that look great on you, serve your type of lifestyle, and work with each other.</p>
<p>You best tools during this stage of wardrobe-building (really the wardrobe-purging stage) will be your bed, a full-length mirror, a camera, and one or two women who understand both your character and what it means to be well-dressed.</p>
<p>The bed is for laying pieces together for matching; this way you can quickly try one pair of pants with several different shirts, and so on. This is valuable not only for wardrobe building, but for determining your outfit for the day too.</p>
<p>Check the mirror. Just because an outfit seems like a good idea, or looks promising matched up on the bed, doesn't mean it will look good <em>on you</em>. Likewise, take pictures of your best outfits (for quick access when dressing for the day), your worst mistakes (so you'll not repeat them), and outfits you're not sure about (to revisit when you've learned more).</p>
<p>Women tend to know more about dressing well than men, and they can also give you a better idea of what other women will respond to. My wardrobe overhaul began when I started listening to what women were saying about clothes. (Note: shoes, socks, and watch matter a lot to many women; often, style-wise; and also sometimes also as an indicator of a man's financial standing.) If you do consult with woman friends, make sure they know who you are and who you want to be, and back you up in that respect. You don't want to be molded into something you're not, much less whipped into paying for a wardrobe to support that. If you have a guy friend who dresses well and is willing to give advice, that's also a great resource; just keep in mind that <em>you</em> are not <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>Although the impulse may be to get it all over with and buy many items at once, this should only be done if you're <strong>absolutely</strong> clear on what you need and how it will all work together. By far a safer and more economical route is to buy some basics, and over time learn the rules little by little. After you've worn some of those basics for some time, you will be more aware of what you need and what you don't.</p>
<p>During the acquisition phase, your next tools will be a color wheel or similar color-theory reference, a good tailor who can accommodate your style (some tailors will be entrenched in their own view, whether it be classic, or modern, or euro, or prep) or a <em>very</em> good seamstress/alterationist, and knowledgeable salespeople. When determining what pieces will go with the rest of your wardrobe, consider that men's style is <em>not</em> so much about matching as it is un-matching in a good way. Don't try to put the same colors together, but add contrast with tones (e.g., light top &amp; dark bottom; or vice versa) and colors (red/blue or yellow/blue vs blue-on-blue), and add interest with textures, from the ridge of twill or corduroy, to the nubbiness of tweed, to the sleekness of leather and metal.</p>
<p>When adding your own unique signature to a classic outfit, don't change too much -- one different, or loudly patterned or colored piece is enough. The brighter or more patterned a piece, in general the more neutral the rest of the supporting outfit should be.</p>
<p>A good salesperson should be knowledgeable and should not push you to buy something. From this person, you can learn a lot. For instance, wear your favorite jacket and shirt to the store and ask for ideas for matching ties, belts, coats, etc. Occasionally, a store manager (look especially for a well-dressed one) can not only help you fill out your wardrobe, but will be willing to give you a discount for buying several pieces at once.</p>
<p>There are several online style guides on how to refurbish your wardrobe. A search for "men's wardrobe basics" or some such combo may turn up useful info.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned in other threads, you'll get a lot of bang for your buck by buying the right shoes and outerwear -- items that will be used often, and with the majority of your wardrobe, and that will be seen first by the greatest number of people.</p>
