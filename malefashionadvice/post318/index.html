  <h1>What does MFA think about my thrift store haul today? (Sorry for the poor picture quality)</h1>

<p>It's okay to dislike guidelines offered here or elsewhere.  Some of those suggestions are personal or group opinion, and some of them are just based on the reality of how form and color, human culture and perception all work together.</p>
<p>It's also okay to dislike guidelines and still try them and learn from them. I don't fault you for trying the vest; and I congratulate you for asking for feedback; and I applaud you for having your own sense of things. Keep trying many things — what you like, and what you don't like. Keep trying things that you think might look good together, keep trying what is suggested by experienced mentors, and keep trying things you'd otherwise never dream of wearing. Then you'll learn.</p>
<p>In fact, you appear to be in the 'summer' of your life, a phase when trying new things is important across the board. <em>Of course</em> you may not know your personal style yet, and perhaps neither your vocation nor your style of moving in the world either. Trying many new things is part of discovering all that.</p>
<p>I do encourage you to learn the basic elements of style, though. Those guidelines are not supposed to limit you, but to free you and help you be more who you are. At first it may feel like rules, but if you learn well you'll know when to keep the rules, when to bend them, and when to break them; and most of all, you'll know <em>why</em> they apply. It's like jazz: first you learn the basics, and then you can play freely.</p>
<p>To get more focused in finding your personal style, I suggest <strong>taking stock of your situation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are your <strong>most frequent activities</strong>? What activities are (or will soon be) <strong>most important to you</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are you with most often; what circles do you hang out in — what parts of society are you mingling with most often? <strong>What relationships do you want to cultivate, and what relationships do you want to change?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are you <strong>best and worst colors</strong>? What colors are not just good in themselves, but make <em>you</em> look fantastic — alive, vibrant, healthy? What colors make you look less 'you' — fading out, too colored in your complexion, sick? With a mirror by a well-lit window, and perhaps the help of a well-dressed friend, try many different colors next to your face, and see which light you up and which make you look 'off'. These color samples can be any fabric or other material, not necessarily just clothing — you just need them near your face. And it's not about what colors you like or what goes well with what (yet); the focus should be on you, not what you wear — it's about what naturally makes <em>you</em> look great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If possible, <strong>get sample swatches of your best colors</strong>; or maybe better yet, take accurate photos and assemble them into a sampler that can be accessed from a mobile device when you go shopping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start <strong>collecting and analyzing images</strong> of mens outfits. All styles are grist for the mill. Consider what works and what doesn't, and why. Over time you may start to identify with one particular style. You can try it, but don't think that it will be an end destination. You'll always be moving, unfolding. Studying images and perhaps <strong>creating a lookbook</strong> collection of them (the good, the bad, and the puzzling) will teach you the guidelines in a different way; it will help you develop your own sense of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're not at all alone in being limited by the money situation. That's why it's even <em>more</em> important to <strong>learn the basics, so that you can be very skillful and efficient in combining what you already have</strong>. The most influential factor in how you look in your clothing — whether you're on a budget or not — <strong>will almost certainly be fit</strong>. You can't look your best in clothes that don't fit well. Once you have taken stock of your situation, you will know better the style and types of clothes that will help you live your life the best. Maybe you already have several pieces in your wardrobe that are very suited to you and your (current and hoped-for) lifestyle. Those clothes should be the first ones that you <strong>optimize for fit and combining</strong>. If it's possible to have them tailored to fit, then piece by piece get that done. If it's not possible to tailor the items that don't fit, then gradually get rid of them and replace them with good looking items that do fit well. <strong>Cultivate a wardrobe in which the pieces can be combined with each other easily</strong> rather than just a collection of random items that only make sense together by accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn how to create outfits</strong> by laying out pieces together on a bed or table. You can quickly and harmlessly try many combinations this way. What do you already own that goes together well? Hopefully this way you can <strong>find several automatic, go-to outfits</strong>. This is also a good way to <strong>learn layering</strong>: starting with a well-matched basic outfit, see what sweater/jacket/coat/hoodie goes well, and what accessories work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
