  <h1>Crew necks and cardigans.</h1>

<p>I'm glad if you find my response at all helpful. Just understand that it's one opinion among many possible ones.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) The <em>standard</em> cardigan length is probably not much farther than halfway down the zipper. There is some give and take depending on the style and cut -- Is it a full cut, chunky sweater? Is it intended to be slouchy, as part of a laid-back look?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, the determining factor shouldn't be a fixed rule about length, but rather how the length affects how the piece looks on you. Longer cardigans tend to reach a point of no return on the angle of the hips and seat; and no matter how you pull them down they will often creep up and find their own place of rest higher on your hips. If there is considerable slack taken up, then the folds and billows become noticeable.</p>
<p>Next, even if you're successful at pulling down the hem of a long sweater, the longer shape on top doesn't create a flattering proportion. You want your upper and lower forms to be in balance, or sometimes even for the upper to appear more compact and the lower to appear elongated. This is the body proportion that is embedded in our cultural consciousness as one that is healthy, normal, and attractive. And that likely has its origins (at least somewhat) in primitive genetic selection, as humans chose mates with strong, compact upper-body muscularity as well as long-striding legs.</p>
<p>It's this very proportion that is played with in outfits that seek to create a sense of discomfort or tension, or otherwise deconstruct the traditional sense of 'normal' or 'ideal'. Long, slouchy sweaters and shirts, and drop-crotch or tapered pants of our modern day; and zoot suits of yesteryear toy ironically with proportion. That is why, for all the comfort that they convey, there is also a sense of rebellious bravado and antagonism to tradition that comes with these outfits.</p>
<p>In shirts and jackets, there's not much you can do about large armholes. That makes the armhole one of the checkpoints you should notice when purchasing a top. With knitwear, <em>sometimes</em> the tailor can 'turn the corner', sewing a new seam up the side and part way along the underarm. It can only usually be done if the piece already has side seams (some knits are one continuous panel); and it means there will be a transition part way down the sleeve. Only experience and knowledge of the geometry of clothing can say when the operation might be a good thing to try. Consult a trusted tailor. (Note that some tailors may not touch knits at all. Occasionally, experienced seamstresses/dressmakers can help you out there.)</p>
<p>Unless you buy very high-end clothing (and even then), you'll often just have to put up with a large or low armhole. Clothing manufacturers design large armholes in attempt to maximize profit by allowing many body types to fit into, and purchase, a single design. The result is a piece that fits no-one well, since <em>no</em> body type has an armpit with that shape. Sometimes you have to decide if the piece is 'good enough'. But the more determination and patience you have in shopping around, the better you can maximize the fit of your whole wardrobe. Eventually you may find stores that consistently carry clothes that fit you well. (Just for example, American Apparel hoodies have slim arms and high armholes.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) You can determine for yourself where the shade of the grey cardigan fits, by finding many different examples of grey -- not only in your wardrobe and in other articles of clothing, but all around you in furniture fabrics, drapes, painted surfaces, and objects. Seeing the whole range, you'll see where the cardigan finds its place. You'll also notice the differences in hue and tint: some greys are warm, with a hint of brown; others are cool, with blue in them; others are truly neutral; and there are variations as well in the amount of white in the grey (which produces a less clear, more milky look) and in the reflectivity and texture and subtle patterns (like marled) in the material.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the picture, it looks like the grey is pretty dark. There's not a lot of terrain between there and black. In any case, it's south of 'mid-grey'.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3.) Color matching is a huge field. Different colors will match in different ways, and produce different effects. There's no one 'good' match; it depends on the effect you want to produce and the palette you have available to work with. Grey and cream has quite a different feel from grey and maroon; but both combinations can look good. Grey will 'go' with practically any color; but the key is what quality you want to evoke.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since grey is such a neutral neutral, you're free to use any color; so why not use one that is ideal next to your face -- one that makes you look radiant? Light blues tend to be good with most skin colors, for instance. Often buff pinks, too.</p>
<p>Same thing with the navy and black: it all depends on what you want to project and what else you're working with. But, with quick-tips: Blues and browns almost always look good together. And the intensity of black can go more formal with the extreme contrast of a white <em>button-up</em>, can bring out the polish of a nice light blue, and can be toned down with mid-tone (not too dark, not too bright) neutrals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(4.) The armhole question was answered above in my response to question 1. As to shortening sleeves; if there's a cuff, it may be possible to cut it off and re-attach it to a shortened sleeve. Consult a tailor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(5.) Shrinkage is an inexact process. Although you can re-shape wool somewhat while it dries (not necessarily after running it in the dryer, but just after a warm or hot soak), I wouldn't <em>count</em> on the results being to your liking. You may find that they shrink where you don't want them to, and don't where you do. If you're so unhappy with the piece that you're planning on tossing it anyway, then a little experiment couldn't hurt. I'm constantly 'modding' my clothes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6.) Yes, that's a pretty good example of a casual outfit. It has several things going for it, the first of which is color. Without the color of the t-shirt, the cardi - pant combination would be dreary. What makes the color work is that it is neither too dull nor too contrasty, and especially that it's integrated in the outfit: the brown shoes and watchband work very well with the ocher of the shirt, and create a sense of unity. (I'm hoping that there's also a brown belt there.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The horizontal nautical stripe also adds visual rhythm and interest. I usually avoid leaving a cardigan to hang open; but I think the row of stripes may help turn sloppiness into laid-back, since the different lengths of lines exposed delineate a shape. (Not sure about that one; but I get that sense. Maybe someone else could chime in on this point.)</p>
<p>The cardigan also seems well fitted. Although we don't see it buttoned up and rolled down, there doesn't seem to be a loose billow at the sides, the shoulders and arms seem not bad, and the length looks about halfway down the zipper. You can see some extra material at the underarm, and the shoulder seam is a bit past the point of the shoulder; but in this outfit -- a very casual, easy, untucked one -- the slouchiness works.</p>
<p>I <em>LOVE</em> the addition of sharp shoes here. They work very well, color-wise; and they show that while an outfit can be extremely relaxed and congenial, it can also be classy.</p>
<p><em>n. -- Sorry for the strange formatting. I couldn't get the paragraphs to line up.</em></p>
