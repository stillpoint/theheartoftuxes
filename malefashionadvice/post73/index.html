  <h1>Doing it right, MFA?</h1>

<p>Forgive me for writing a lot here; but there is a lot of potential here, and there are a lot of learning points as well.</p>
<p>I want to see the whole outfit and your whole form, from top to bottom. It's important to get the sense of the <em>whole</em> -- not just the pieces of clothing and not just how they go together, but how everything goes together with <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>An important part of that <em>whole</em> is the context. We can't say if you're doing it right until we know what the outfit is for, what it is supposed to achieve, and what the situation is (the locale, activity, your personal style, age, etc.). What's right for someone else may not be right for you; and what's right for you in one situation may not be right in another.</p>
<p>The colors in the shirt are fantastic for you. That sky/cadet blue with a bit of white is fresh and bright and optimistic, and it's flattering for your own coloration (skin color and eyes). And I like that you chose that shirt, because that indicates that you might have an eye for color and a willingness to try something a bit different. The thing is, the contrast collar shirt is almost a symbol of a formal, professional milieu; it has such strong associations with <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/2012/02/gordon-gekko.jpg">financiers and stock market traders</a> that those associations still echo for people when you use the shirt in a more casual way.</p>
<p>You are right in your instinct! Without the cultural meaning, and purely on visual content, this would be a great, handsome look for you. But because of the cultural meaning, you'll get some people thinking (and mentioning) that the shirt is "too formal" for that outfit. You may care about that; you may not.</p>
<p>For a jeans/dress shirt/tie sharp-casual outfit, a narrow knit tie like you're wearing is a good choice; it is indeed both sharp and casual, and is appropriate for a youthful look. I like that it is in a solid color. The black is a very sharp contrast with both the blue and white in the shirt, and is of course a good match with black jeans. It should be tied shorter, reaching just around the top of the belt.</p>
<p>The whole idea of a tie with jeans is a bit sketchy. Not that it can't be done, but it's a bit overplayed. A lot of clothing store salespeople will talk about "dressing down" an outfit with jeans; but really the trend these days is: if you're wearing a sharp-casual shirt and tie, wear sharp-casual pants (like nice chinos rather than jeans). That is, let the bottom part of the outfit be closer in level of formality to the top.</p>
<p>Having said that, if that kind of outfit is good for anyone, it's good for a young, good-looking guy like yourself.</p>
<p>There's also the question of whether a jacket should always be worn when a tie is worn. Usually, yes; but again, it <em>seems</em> like this is for a very young sharp-casual look, so the lack of jacket and open collar make sense. Here is where you have to consider the context. What situation will you be entering, and what image are you hoping to project? If, for instance, you're only going to be around teenagers, you may be avoiding many of the cautions I mentioned above that would apply for older guys among their peers.</p>
<p>The belt, again, shows a good instinct for color but is not quite right. I like that you chose some contrast between the belt and jeans and between the belt and shirt. The difference in color is interesting — more interesting than a black dress belt would have been; and the color and style of belt is casual, and adds to the casual nature of the outfit. But it is <em>too</em> casual, and the brown doesn't go well with the black. In this case, the more boring black dress belt would have matched better. A taupe (grey-brown) would also have provided contrast without being such an off-putting combination with the black; and a suede belt would have straddled the line better between the too-conservative dress belt and the too-casual chunky leather belt. If the tie were navy, you could make a case for a brown belt; but the sharp (formal and contrasty) tandem of the double black calls for a sharper belt.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> precedent for a brown belt among black pieces. This is where we need to see the shoes as well, and how everything comes off as a whole. <a href="http://www.upscalehype.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/David_Beckham_Mosley_Tribe_Sunglasses_David_Lindwall_t-shirt_Dior_Homme_Jeans-2.jpg">David Beckham</a>, for one, sometimes wears a brown belt, even with dark-wash and black jeans. <a href="http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/927/davidbeckhambestlooksou.jpg">Tan and taupe</a> also come into play (and are more classically correct with black). Shoes will match the belt, or will otherwise make sense with the rest of the outfit. And you <em>will</em> see him wear a <a href="http://thegloss.com/files/2009/12/91130M13_BECKHAM_B-GR_06.jpg">chunky and casual black leather belt</a> at other times with the black jeans. Of course, his outfits tend to be more casual, and are guided by a very sophisticated sense of style (both his and his wife's). In his dressier outfits involving black pants, even he will (correctly) opt for a black dress belt.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Gordon Gekko link added; typo corrected; wording.</p>
<p>Oh, and let's note that the shirt fits very well, even if the sleeves could be rolled better (to just above the elbows).</p>
