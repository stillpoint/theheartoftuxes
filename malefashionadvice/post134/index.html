  <h1>Would MFA be so kind as to rate my prospective purchases?</h1>

<p>We can offer what <em>we</em> would like; but it may have nothing to do with you and your situation. It's better if we know the context: where do you intend to wear the pieces; what kinds of outfits do you already wear, and in what style; what do you look like in terms of coloration, hairstyle, and body shape; what is already in your wardrobe that you will want to match with; and is there a gap in your wardrobe that you are hoping to fill?</p>
<p>Sigh unseen, here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Polo Ralph Lauren shirt has a nice fabric, but the color is too dark for the shirt to be versatile. It also comes off as messy. Some Oxford cloth shirts look good when rumpled; this one, not so much. The shape seems like a very boxy fit, which will contribute to the messiness. The buttoned patch pockets clutter the front of the shirt, and are very, awkwardly close together. The double shoulder seam and eyelet at the underarm seem more appropriate for a sun-shirt for hiking or fishing. The collar looks flimsy compared to the thickness of the herringbone fabric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kitsun√© Western Chambray has a nice weave, if you can handle the way the chambray cross-hatching stands out. Chambray is generally very versatile due to its color, texture, and its ability to range between casual and dressy. This shirt, however, will have a more limited range because of its western styling (the front shoulder yoke and western pockets). It will generally stay on the more casual side of things, and will look better paired with jeans than with chinos or dress pants. I'd prefer not to have the contrast logo on the front, but maybe the bold weave pattern makes it a wash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hartford Blue Button-down seems like the kind of basic shirt that forms the foundation of a wardrobe -- good to have one or two of. <em>BUT</em> it is cut very short, and is clearly intended to be worn untucked, which looks terrible. The cut doesn't seem especially slim, and I would expect untucked shirts to be a bit more interesting and less conservative in color and pattern. It's like a mullet-shirt: conservative up top, and trying to be laid back at the hem. Not working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Black Fleece Cotton Chambray shirt seems like the best cut of the bunch. The sleeves look long in proportion to the body; but if you can find a good fit this may be the most versatile of the shirts you linked to. A chambray pattern is not visible online; this just looks like a plain blue shirt, which is not bad. If a weave pattern <em>is</em> visible in person, so much the better as it will be a bit more interesting. Since it's technically a chambray and not an oxford, it is a bit less casual and easy-going -- something you'd expect to wear with sweaters or sportjackets and casual ties -- but I personally don't like a tie with a button-down collar. You'll have to decide if this will help your wardrobe, or if either a more rough-and-tumble oxford or a crisper dress shirt will be of more use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Band Of Outsiders white chinos are a straight cut, and with the cut of the seat seam it makes for extra fabric under the seat and along the back of the thigh. If you don't mind that -- if your general look is more of a looser, classic style than modern and close to the body -- no problem. They also have a notch cut out of the waistband that would hopefully be covered up by a belt. The chino will be a middle-of-the-road option, just slightly less casual than a jean. I like the monkstrap shoes modelled with them. A <em>white</em> chino will probably only be worn rarely. Although it's traditionally more of a summer look you can go ahead and wear it in the fall and winter too; but in a chino, more off-white (stone or cream) would be more versatile and not quite as 'in your face'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Woolrich Wool-blend navy cardigan is an otherwise nondescript thin layering piece with quite a bold (arbitrary?) accent on the elbows. The lumberjack plaid elbow patches make this a decidedly fall/winter piece, and will likely look awkward in other seasons. It also falls firmly into the casual, outdoorsy end of things as long as those patches are visible. Jeans &amp; cords, yes; chinos, not so much. I can't see dressing this up with a tie; but the t-shirt look the model is wearing looks shleppy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The J Crew Slim white jean is slightly more rough-hewn than the white chinos, and more appropriate with the Western Chambray, for example. If you're looking for a casual white pant, my sense is that a jean would be more versatile than a chino, depending on the rest of your wardrobe. The cream color is less glaring and more matchable than a clear white. It may just be the model's body shape, but the jean seems to have a medium-to-high rise, which may be a consideration. The slim leg is a more contemporary look.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Note that a lot of your selections -- the chambray shirts and white pants -- are generally considered warm-weather clothing. Picture the light blue-on-white: it's very sunny and summery. I've done white jeans and a green army jacket in the winter, but rarely. Good luck in your choices.</p>
