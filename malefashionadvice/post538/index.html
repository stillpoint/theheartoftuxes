  <h1>Does this dress shirt need to be tailored?</h1>

<p>Not only tailored; you need a new shirt, because that one is too big. Did you check the sidebar guide on <a href="http://redd.it/ehrtv">How Clothes Should Fit</a> before posting?</p>
<p>Go to a tailor and get your measurements taken. Write them down on a card to keep in your wallet, as a reference for when you go shopping. "Small / Medium / Large" shirts don't always conform to a standard; you may take a Medium in one brand and a Small in another. But "Collar and Sleeve" shirts provide the measurement for the collar size and sleeve length. When you know your correct measurements you can narrow down the search. If you really want to be efficient about it, you can bring a small retractable tape measure with you when you shop, to check the dimensions of the garments before you go to the trouble of trying them on.</p>
<p>The first thing you should check is how the shirt fits at the shoulders, around the upper chest, and at the collar, as these will be nearly impossible to correct later. In general, these points determine whether the shirt can be worn by you at all.</p>
<p>After that, sleeve length and fit around the body should be as close as possible to your correct size and proportions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The shoulder seams on the shirt should line up with the point of your shoulder, the bony crest of your shoulder joint. If there's any leeway there, it's a matter of a centimeter; but here the shoulder seam is slung all the way past your whole shoulder â€” too wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upper chest and back area is clearly too big, with the fabric spreading out loosely like a wing on the side with the raised arm. You'll also be able to see this extra fabric as large folds radiating from the underarm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The collar may be a bit loose. Generally, you should only be able to fit one finger in between the collar and neck. Some prefer two fingers (flat against the neck, not stacked against each other), but more snug is visually better, and especially better when the collar is closed and worn with a tie. Guys that seldom or never wear (closed) collared shirts often feel an abnormal restriction and go too loose with their collars; but it just takes some getting used to. Wear a collar and tie more often to get used to the feeling, so that you can be at ease when you dress up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sleeves are much too long. You can see the folds of extra fabric bunching up at the end of the sleeve, and the cuff is too far down your hand. The cuff should end at the base of your thumb, just over the wrist bone. Also, the closed cuff is holding the sleeve at its current length; the cuff should hit at the right spot whether it's closed or not (though you would keep the cuffs fastened when dressing up).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sleeves are too wide. Again you can see the extra billows of fabric wrapping the arm. Wide sleeves are the least noticed 'fit flaws', and are often overlooked if the rest of the shirt fits. Even so, when they get too wide it's a bad look, and slimming them closer to the arm almost invariably looks better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another issue when you're looking at arm width is the size of the armhole. High armholes closer to the armpit are much better, and a sign of higher quality. The first instinct is to think that a lower armhole will be more comfortable because it provides more room; but if you consider the geometry of it, you'll see that the low armhole restricts movement. When you raise your arm, the arm seam attached lower down on the body of the garment acts as a lever that pulls on the shirt. You'll never be able to raise your arms without pulling your shirt out of your pants. A high armhole offers more mobility, and will naturally make for a slimmer, better-looking sleeve as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shirt is very big around the body. The correct fit would have the garment just skimming the surface of the body without clinging. "Classic" (old-school) fit will be a bit wider, and have some puffing out at the waist; but that's neither a modern nor young nor body-enhancing look, and you're best to avoid it. An inch or two of extra fabric around the body can be taken in by a tailor; but any more than that will create awkward spots elsewhere in the shirt if taken in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A tailor can slim the waist and create a nice shape by installing darts in the back, which will help the shirt follow the curve of your spine; and / or the tailor can take the shirt in at the side seam, creating a good shape when viewed from the front. The tailor will be able to say which alteration(s) will make for the best look. And over time you'll learn how <em>you</em> like your shirts to look, and you'll be able to instruct the tailor more specifically. Only work with tailors that will preserve the <em>felled</em> double-stitched seam on the side of the shirt and up the sleeves; some (lower-class) tailors only run one line of stitching, which may be okay for casual shirts like some tees and polos, but isn't suitable for a dress shirt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can't see clearly, but I would guess that the shirt is also quite long on you, covering the crotch. While long tails are usually not a huge problem when you tuck the shirt in, too much material can create unsightly bunching that shows through your dress pants. And you'll also need to decide whether you'll be wearing your shirt tucked or untucked most of the time, since untucked length must be shorter (usually about halfway down the zipper, give or take an inch) and the tails must have a shallower curve if untucked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
