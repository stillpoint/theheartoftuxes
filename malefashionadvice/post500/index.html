  <h1>Bought clothes at H&M for the first time in 6 years</h1>

<p>If you buy clothes that fit well and match together you should look great. Read the sidebar guides, especially the guides on Getting Started. You need to learn about proper fit.</p>
<p>Also check the thread on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/16rwft/how_to_take_better_self_pics_for_mfa/">How To Take Better Self Pics For MFA.</a> Your jacket is barely visible, and its impossible to see how it fits with your arms up.</p>
<p>You don't have to limit yourself to online shopping. People who work for clothing stores expect you to use their fitting rooms or take clothes home to try. For most stores, sales would suffer if people couldn't try on their clothing. If you can't bear using the fitting rooms at the store, buy clothing at stores with a good return policy. Usually you have 2 to 4 weeks to return clothes for a full refund if the tags are still attached and if you haven't worn the clothes (worn them for the day, as opposed to just trying them on). So you can buy a whole pile of clothes and see how they work with each other and with your current wardrobe; and you can check how they look on you, and how they make <em>you</em> look.</p>
<p>That's a very helpful practice for building a new wardrobe. You should be trying on many pieces, seeing how they fit, how the colors work for your skin tone, and how versatile they are in combining with other pieces you own or are thinking of buying. Don't worry or feel that you have to buy something every time you go shopping. I think I know quite a bit about putting together an outfit, and I still try on lots of clothing â€” partly to check how it looks on me, and partly to experiment with things I might not try otherwise. Sometimes you'll be surprised to find that items you assumed look weird or bad actually look great, and sometimes you'll find they bring out a new side of you that you like.</p>
<p>A lot of people hate shopping because it brings up self-image issues. They think that if they don't find the perfect piece after checking a couple of stores that means that they've failed or that something's wrong with them. That's not true. Sometimes you have to try a lot of different things before you find something that works for you; that's just the nature of clothes shopping, it doesn't make you a special case. Over time you'll get to know the stores that sell clothes that fit you better, and that will make shopping easier. And if you come across a lot of items that don't fit or look good on you, then you can learn a lot from them â€” about what doesn't work together, what your good and bad colors are, what brands you should avoid, and so on.</p>
<p>If the girls you hang out with want to go shopping with you, maybe they are looking forward to helping you change your look. If that's the case it means that they have a positive image of you, a vision of you looking great in a particular outfit or style. For someone to hold a positive image of you is great!</p>
<p>Coming from a hip-hop style, you may have to get used to better fitting clothes. You can buy clothes that fit well that are still comfortable, but proper fit will be one of the most important factors in looking better â€” <em>especially</em> if you are concerned with your body shape or size.</p>
<p>Loose, baggy clothing isn't doing you any favors. It doesn't camouflage your body but actually makes you look bigger, as well as sloppy. Start moving away from hoodies and formless jackets. The droopy hem, hanging hood, and formless neckline of a hoodie is not good for you. Look for pieces with more structure in the shoulders, collar, cuffs, and even the body, since these will help to create a sharp, broad-shouldered, upright form that presents you the best.</p>
<p>Jackets made of stiffer fabric like twill, and possibly with a structured or gathered waist can work well for you. For example, the smooth, straight shoulders and collar of <a href="http://www.ark.co.uk/prodimg/Merc_London_Cream_Harrington_Jacket17_1_408.jpg">this Harrington jacket,</a> along with its fabric which has some body to it, create a much better profile for you than a slouchy jacket. In another example, a <a href="http://tbl.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pTBL1-12864053v275.jpg">field jacket with a drawsting waist</a> can create a nice athletic shape by creating a bit of a vee from the shoulders to the waist.</p>
<p>Get pieces that fit. If it doesn't fit, don't force it; just move on and find something that works for you. The pants that you are wearing are too tight around the hips and are too long. If you find pants (probably in a larger waist size) that fit around the seat and hips but are an inch or two too big at the waist, you can have the waist taken in by a tailor. Most people will not find the perfect fit at the store; so you should learn what a tailor can to to help you achieve the perfect fit â€” a fit that is both comfortable and good looking. You can even bring the clothing you've purchased to a tailor before removing the tags, so that he can give you advice and help you choose which pieces to return.</p>
