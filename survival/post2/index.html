  <h1>What would be the best sustenance to keep in a Altoids EDC kit?</h1>

<p>To know the best food to add to an EDC kit you should consider the purpose. Any food taken in a tiny container is not going to address a long-term situation; rather, it would be meant to tide you over quickly and temporarily — to get you over the hump or give you the edge in a critical situation. As such, trying for a "balance of nutrients" isn't necessarily the most efficient use of your limited space.</p>
<p>Let's consider the critical, short-term situations that could be swayed in your favor with the addition of a small bite-sized bit of something ingestible. While doing so, let's consider their comparative risk and the comparative benefit or influence on the situation:</p>
<p><strong>Hyponatremia.</strong> In extreme heat or in other situations where you've been losing minerals through your sweat the mineral balance (especially the Sodium balance) within the body goes off. This causes fluid usually residing outside of cells to enter the cells and enlarge them. This is an understandable danger when it comes to brain cells swelling in the skull.</p>
<p>The body's core temperature can remain normal and other symptoms of "heat illness" may or may not be present; the key to identifying hyponatremia is often in perceiving shifts of mood and mental capacity. Possible symptoms: general malaise, dour or listless mood, confusion, headache, seizures, cramps, muscle weakness, nausea. Loss of consciousness and death can follow, and it can also be the case that diminished mental capacity or defeatist mood takes the individual deeper into danger with the decisions they make. Although you should drink well for other reasons, drinking large amounts of water without replacing minerals can speed the onset of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can also strike hours <em>after</em> exertion.</p>
<p>The inclusion of electrolyte replacement in an EDC kit could be life-saving, and takes very little space and weight. I always carry a packet of Emergen-C (an excellent electrolyte replacement, and better than many powders and drinks marketed specifically for the purpose) in my EDC kit. This particular powder formula also has a lot of vitamin C, so I'll also down some at the first sign of a cold or flu. If I'm going to be hiking or doing other stressful activity for several days or weeks, I will of course take along more packets. A bullion cube helps replace Sodium, but not necessarily other minerals that may be dangerously depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustion/low blood sugar.</strong> The effort involved in daily work or recreational activities requires calories as fuel; and brain function in particular requires a constant minimum level of blood sugar. In emergencies, these demands can increase dramatically. There may be times when you are not able to replenish the calories with a regular meal, and so the blood sugar level drops. Lightheadedness, dizziness, confusion, impaired judgment, and sullen mood are typical symptoms. (Sound familiar ^ ?)</p>
<p>While a small bite of food can only temporarily address long-term malnutrition issues, it <em>can</em> provide the blood sugar that returns you to a functional state in an emergency. Quick sugar release will, of course, have a faster effect; but it can also cause a sugar spike that causes more insulin to be released, subsequently bringing blood sugar levels down further. So a quick sugar release must be followed soon by more complete sustenance. A <em>combination</em> of quick release and gradual release is ideal for many survival situations; this is the profile of many fruits. Dried fruits, fruit leathers, and some energy gels (as used by long-distance runners) offer both quick and slow release of sugar. Perhaps the best and most handy of these would be prunes and dates, which also offer a lot of Potassium. (And one shouldn't underestimate the value of a constipation treatment when surviving on a diet you're not used to.) Packets of honey also offer fast and slow release, plus possibly minerals and vitamins, depending on the kind of flowers the bees fed upon and on whether the honey has been pasteurized. Honey also may serve as a first-aid antiseptic ointment and excellent sore throat treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Morale &amp; comfort.</strong> This category should not be overlooked by any means. It is often the difference-maker: some assistance in calming down, regaining composure, and instilling a sense of comfort may reset an addled, hyper-reactive frenzy into a more organized, beneficial activity that can save you. The mere <em>taste</em> of sugar can be a great comfort, not to mention the benefit of a boost of energy. Search-and-rescue personnel often carry a candy bar to stuff in the mouth of people who in their traumatized state resist help (sometimes violently); usually the moment they taste the sugar, the people return to a more reasonable, grounded state. A simple hard candy can serve a similar purpose.</p>
<p>The first step in prioritizing a survival situation is outlined in the <em>S T O P</em> mnemonic — Stop, Think, Observe, Plan. The encouragement to <em>stop</em> and settle down can make all the difference between rushing around frenetically, and gathering oneself to apply one's skills and resources efficiently to the task at hand. So the presence of a bullion cube in a survival kit is a suggestion to <em>stop</em>, settle down, and collect oneself. The directed activities of boiling water and preparing the soup can offer a sense that one has some degree of control over one's situation — that actions can be taken to improve the odds; and the ingestion of a hot beverage (not really a "meal", but interpreted as one) can mean a tremendous boost of morale as well as an important edge in cold weather or hypothermic conditions. As mentioned above, a bullion cube also offers Sodium replacement but not complete mineral replacement; its major benefit for an EDC or pocket survival kit is its compact form. Other instant soups are just as viable. These items can also contribute to comfort by incorporating strange foodstuffs (gathered plants, fungi, small game) into a more palatable soup.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I wouldn't object to the presence of a bullion cube in a survival kit; but its <em>purpose</em> should be understood.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term nutrition; tissue repair.</strong> Protein levels (for tissue repair and immune system support), meal replacement, and vitamin deficiencies are <em>not</em> immediately critical, and will <em>not</em> be well addressed by anything you can carry in an EDC or small survival kit. They should definitely be considered in the larger scheme of things with the additional food you carry or store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Please understand that this is <em>my opinion</em> only; but based on the above considerations I would think that appropriate food items for an EDC kit would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packet(s) of <a href="http://www.emergenc.com/">Emergen-C</a> or other electrolyte replacement</li>
<li>Prunes and/or packet(s) of <a href="http://www.bees-online.com/HealthBenefitsOfHoney.htm">honey</a> and/or <em>long-release</em> energy gel like <a href="http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/reviews/nutrition/energy-gels/science-in-sport-go-gel/9351.html">Go Gel</a> or <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/ham/gel.html?MCID=F-PRICEG&amp;mr%3areferralID=56d54829-275a-11e2-8751-001b2166c2c0">Hammer Gel</a> (note that many gels are not long-release).</li>
<li>Bullion cube or packet of instant soup.</li>
<li>Optional hard candy / Mars bar / protein bar / meal replacement bar / granola bar — mostly for the immediate comfort, but be aware of the blood sugar spike and rebound.</li>
</ul>
