  <h1>Made a new ultralight survival kit today</h1>

<p>In your survival kit, whether it is ultralight or expedition-style, it is very important to include <em>context</em>. There is no perfect kit; there is only a more or less appropriate kit for certain situations. So you need to look into the situation you will be addressing, with includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Locale</li>
<li>Terrain</li>
<li>Climate and Weather</li>
<li>Other gear carried</li>
<li>Your knowledge, experience, skill-set, and physical ability</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, any "my survival kit" posts without mention of the scenarios for which they are created are vague and fantastical.</p>
<p>When talking about ultralight kits, we're either talking about emergency support for short trips or a "leg up" for someone extremely capable at shaping the surroundings to meet his needs. If one has an uncommon level of knowledge and <em>proven</em> skill, balanced by other essential gear at hand, the survival kit can be small and basic. Less experience, less knowledge, and less essential gear carried require a much more complete and well-focused survival kit.</p>
<p>"Survival" isn't by any means necessarily limited to wilderness survival. But let's look at the scenarios most appropriately addressed by the items in your kit. In a light pocket kit for day hikes in somewhat familiar territory, the most significant emergency scenarios will involve <strong>exposure, losing your way, or injury</strong>. The required activities will be heavily weighted toward saving yourself in the first hours rather than lasting for many days or weeks. Therefore food acquisition items like a fishing kit are far down the list of priorities. Where food may be helpful is in providing a quick calorie boost to help the body create warmth or undertake vigorous activities like fire building or hiking to a known safe place; so easy-eat food is more helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure</strong>, which in most cases will mean <strong>hypothermia</strong>, is the most common wilderness danger. Besides firemaking items, protective and insulating items are a priority. In fact, as a general rule the most important survival items you can take are <em>proper clothing</em>. (Extra carried water follows, as protection against dehydration.) If we're limiting our analysis to a carried kit, a stuffable windshirt and/or space blanket may be good ultralight personal-shelter items. A tarp-poncho is very versatile, but perhaps wouldn't be considered ultralight.</p>
<p>In hot climates, <strong>heat stroke</strong> and <strong>dehydration</strong> may be concerns in terms of exposure. A space blanket can help here as well, providing ventilated shade when set up parallel to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Getting found</strong> or <strong>getting help</strong> is a remedy for countless survival scenarios, so signalling, communication, and navigation items should be high on the list of priorities; and those items should be proven to be effective. Cell phone in an area with coverage (with extra battery or charger) can be very effective. Carrying a super-loud whistle is almost a no-brainer — it's so light, so noticeable, and so helpful in cases where you may be too weak to use your voice. A signal patch (perhaps your "large bandage") and the knowledge to make an <strong>instantly visible</strong> signal fire (made <em>before</em> the rescue party patrols the area) increase your chances of being found. Foolproof writing implements and waterproof paper allow you to <strong>leave a note</strong> in case you <em>have</em> to leave your original location (only recommended as a last resort), or in case you may lose consciousness and not be able to communicate what happened (blow on the head, snake bite, poisoning, fever...?).</p>
<p>Check and double-check your compass. Many button compasses work erratically because bubbles are introduced; and many more just don't work at all. Make sure you have the necessary <strong>reference</strong> (map) and <strong>knowledge</strong> of how to use map and compass — without them, even a functioning compass may be useless. If you don't have, or have lost, a topographical map of the area, even a scribbled map may be a help — another reason to bring paper and writing instruments. You may sometimes need to accurately <strong>retrace</strong> your steps or <strong>communicate</strong> your intended path of travel.</p>
<p>If you're going to be needing a saw, you'll likely be needing a bigger one. In temperate climates, most of the short-term fire and shelter material you'll need can be found on the ground, broken off of trees, or harvested with a good knife. In colder weather or more extreme areas, a bucksaw and axe may be absolute requirements to gather the large amounts of fuel needed for survival. Since you have a razor blade in the kit, a razor knife may be redundant; or vice versa. Of course, you always want to have enough sharp-edged tools; but you <em>will</em> be carrying a good, very functional knife, won't you?</p>
<p>I like the multiple firestarting methods included, but for an ultralight kit a lighter, sparker, and ferro rod (which all include practically the same sparking item) are redundant. You might afford to let go of the heaviest item, the ferro rod, or replace it with matches or another small lighter carried in another pocket: it will be easier to use, will weigh less, and will still be with you if you get separated from your kit for any reason.</p>
<p>Water, of course, is far a more vital resource than food in most situations. <strong>The water kit defines the duration part of your context.</strong> 4 tablets will serve you for a couple of days perhaps, so you should figure to be within about a day's walk from civilization in any direction if relying on this kit. Any longer, and you should be including a larger, more secure carrying vessel and a way of purifying water by boiling (which can be repeated indefinitely, given the presence of fire). A steel or aluminum mug or canteen could be of tremendous value, even if only for its convenience as opposed to a flimsy and flexible poly bag. As mentioned in my other post in this thread, any rehydration strategy should take into account the loss of electrolyte minerals; so one or two electrolyte replacement tabs or packets are a good addition.</p>
<p>Most things that need to be sewn can be temporarily held in place by a pin, tied with string, or taped with duct tape. Some kind of pin or needle is a helpful tool, though, for certain minor surgical procedures and certain bushcraft tasks. I have no objection to the first aid/med kit, though most short-term cuts, scrapes, and burns can be addressed by a single natural panacea such as the balsam from black cottonwood or balsam fir.</p>
<p>Seeing (in addition to being seen) is one of the most critical abilities in a wilderness emergency survival situation. Eye protection (sunglasses) for the day and flashlight for the night will help you stay functional.</p>
<p>In response to your ultralight kit, consider this collection of gear for casual day-trips or overnight trips in temperate wilderness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mora knife</li>
<li>Wool sweater</li>
<li>Sil-nyl poncho tarp (or tube tent, compactor bag, or space blanket)</li>
<li>Large bright square scarf</li>
<li>12' paracord</li>
<li>6' duct tape</li>
<li>Large safety pin</li>
<li>Aluminum mug</li>
<li>Platypus water bladder</li>
<li>4 purification tabs</li>
<li>Emergen-C packet</li>
<li>Several prunes in a ziploc</li>
<li>Fox 40 whistle</li>
<li>Petzl headlamp (or small handheld flashlight)</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Silva compass (or button compass if tested accurate)</li>
<li>5 waterproof memo sheets (or waterproof notebook)</li>
<li>Golf pencil and/or marker pen</li>
<li>2 sets of lighter/matches + tinder: 1 set in shirt pocket, 1 in pants pocket</li>
<li>Small container of balsam</li>
<li>Cell phone?</li>
</ul>
<p>Add insect repellant, sunscreen, and eyewear depending on conditions. At the cost of a few grams, I might also like to bring along a few feet of fluorescent hunter's tape for marking a path of travel, both to help find the way back to a home base if exploring side trails, and to help rescuers follow in the case that staying put (the preferred option) is not possible.</p>
<p>On overnight trips I also like to include a high-quality true signal mirror. This is mostly for use as a personal mirror, to help with self-care procedures on areas of the body you can't see (supposing you sit on something that sticks in you, or ticks or leeches attach, or you get something in your eye or face). But since I would then use it as a signal mirror if necessary, it should be a proper signal mirror. Even some so-called signal mirrors are useless — not visible from a hundred yards away; check the mirror's reflectivity and resolution yourself, and don't just believe the packaging.</p>
<p><em>XELBRUJOX</em> is right to remind us that cash money can be especially helpful in many situations once contact is made.</p>
<p>In my suggested kit, the heavier and bulkier items make up for it through their sheer usefulness, redundant and inessential items are reduced, and the most common risks are addressed first and foremost.</p>
