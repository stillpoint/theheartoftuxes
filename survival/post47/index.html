  <h1>Hello. I'm new here, and would really appreciate y'all's input on something.</h1>

<p>I don't have experience with the Exos, but Osprey makes good bags, and are known for their suspension systems, which many find to be very comfortable. You really need to test it out yourself, because what works for someone may be hell for someone else.</p>
<p>A backpacking trip, to my mind, has a different aim and activity than a fishing or hunting trip; and so the gear is rightly different. I have a lot of interest in survival training, including training in effective food acquisition; but by the same token I have very little interest in recreational fishing or hunting. I try to keep my relationship with the wilderness very respectful, so I don't want to go out there with the thought of killing my brother beings.</p>
<p>In the urgency that can develop around preparing — finding the right gear, making the best choices, avoiding danger, increasing comfort (and these are not necessarily the right priorities) — the imagination can start to run. Especially if you're not in natural settings very often, the great outdoors can, in your own mind, become a sort of obstacle or enemy that you think you have to guard against or defeat. But really it is very much the other way around. Over an evolution of millions of years we have been supported by nature; it is where our bodies come from and where they will return, and our hearts and minds are also originally most at home in the open wilderness. Your natural being and the being of Nature are not separate, are not different.</p>
<p>So rather than thinking in terms of weapons, you might think in terms of keeping a correct relationship with the area you'll be entering. Learn how not to disturb the animals going about their business and how not to attract danger to yourself, and you'll be fine. If you begin with the notion that you don't belong and that you have to defend yourself, then everything will start looking like a potential foe, and you'll create your own disasters.</p>
<p>With open hands, you will be ready to give and receive and build and defend; with hands fixed on a weapon, you will be ready for nothing but that which the weapon sees.</p>
<p>As to food, you must carry the food that you will need to eat, and you should also carry extra food in case you are delayed by any number of situations (injury, weather, losing your way, etc.). Counting on the wilderness to provide your food is making two BIG assumptions: the availability of it within the area you're visiting, and your absolute expertise at harvesting it. On the second point, you would be so experienced and skilled and knowledgeable that this forum would really be the last place you'd be hanging out at; there would be no doubt as to your extreme expertise. But even if that were the case, there is no guarantee that the fish or game will be there to be caught, or that it will be there when you need it.</p>
<p>I carry grains and dried vegetables, dried soups, and sometimes prepackaged pasta meals for evening hot meals. On rare occasion I'll bring a plastic-packed tuna or even more rarely a dried sausage; but for the most part I much prefer the less messy and less smelly meals of grains. For protein and fat I add hard dry cheese (like parmesan) and nut butters, and for its great calorie-to-weight ratio and many other benefits I carry olive oil to add to the meals. The most I'll cook for breakfast will be tea. Leftover grain from the night before is easy and lets me get on the trail in a hurry. Sometimes just water and a power bar or some trail mix will be a good, quick breakfast. Lunches vary, but only involve hot tea or cooked food if it's cold out. Some people will like more luxury to their meals, but in any case they will carry what they intend to eat. Assuming you're going to find something along the trail is courting disaster.</p>
<p>Gear and expertise <em>must</em> be in balance, and this balance <em>must</em> be found by unflinching honesty. This is more mature and manly than putting on airs and convincing yourself or others that you know more than you do. So the less you know, the more supporting gear you have to bring to be safe. The more experience and skill you gain, the more you can cut down on gear. The most skilled backwoodsman can survive in some areas with just his bare hands; add a knife, and it's like going to the supermarket. But even with great skill, many areas are now devoid of enough biomatter or diversity to sustain a person. That's important to acknowledge too.</p>
<p>Get your backpacking kit together, and focus on simply being with the environment. Outside of certain special circumstances, fishing poles, guns, and other extraneous gear will just get in the way and add to your burden.</p>
<p>Hammocking is a whole topic in itself. It's one way to go lighter, and it can be a great way to have a closer relationship to the woods. I've used a Hennessy Hammock for backpacking; long story short: awesome for sleeping, but frustrating for stowing gear, getting dressed, doing personal care or other tasks, and problematic to keep warm. These days I prefer a tarptent (for use in norther parts of North America, in woods and on mountain trails). I still use a hammock for short trips and car camping.</p>
