  <h1>Tried meditation for the first time last night. Not sure if I am doing it right?</h1>

<p>Your experience is completely normal and extremely common. It would be exceedingly rare for someone <em>not</em> to experience the constant movement of thinking and the agitating attachment to it. That glimpse of your thinking mind's activity is very important, even if it is at first uncomfortable. You got to see your predicament! How fortunate! This is something that most people are unaware of; and since they are unaware, they as yet have no chance for freedom from the prison of thoughts.</p>
<p>But you got to see, to some extent, the thinking that is always churning, always causing an agitation, a suffering below the surface. And now, realizing that your mind is not under control, you can choose to do something about it, to move in the other direction toward self-control and freedom.</p>
<p>The most important point is to know what constitutes self-control. It is <em>not</em> that you can make thinking disappear. Even if you could, that would be a bad relationship with your mind. Self-control means that you are no longer <em>attached</em> to the movement of your mind: your thinking can proceed as it always does, but you are not moved by it.</p>
<p>So meditation means letting go of the thinking and returning to the present moment. You let go, without demanding that the thinking disappear or be anything in particular. You just return to the method of meditation. It is the power of your returning that is your true power.</p>
<p>For many beginners counting the breath is a better approach, since it provides an extra structure, an extra anchor to return to. If you lose count after a couple of breaths, that's no problem. In fact, that shows me that you are doing the practice correctly. It is rare for someone just starting meditation practice to be able to get all the way to 10 cleanly; so if I hear that someone is able to count 10 consecutive breaths, I am suspicious. Either they are uncommonly capable, or they are cheating.</p>
<p>It is important to keep the form strictly. Don't allow yourself an "out". The form is your mirror. It shows you what is happening with your mind. If you keep the form strictly, then you will see very clearly when your mind wanders, and why. But if you fudge it and compromise with the form to make it easier, then when your mind wanders you may not notice it well — your mirror is not clear.</p>
<p>So when practicing counting meditation you should return to "one" every time thinking takes you away. It may take you away for a few seconds or a few minutes, or sometimes for half an hour or several hours. That doesn't matter; that's beyond your control. Your mind wanders because (A) it is the nature of the thinking to think, and (B) because of the habits of attachment build up over the course of a lifetime (and some would say over the course of <em>many</em> lifetimes). So when you get lost in thinking, that's just your mind habit expressing itself. No problem. But the moment you realize it, it is both vital and wonderful to return to the present moment. <em>Immediately</em> and <em>effortlessly</em> return.</p>
<p>So when you wander off in a train of thinking, once you realize you have wandered off, instantly drop it and return to the method: "One... two... three...." If you return instantly and without making a drama, then your power of returning is strengthened. But if you create more thoughts about why you went away, or how difficult it is, or that you are good or bad at meditation, etc., then you are adding to your thinking habit and making your thinking prison stronger.</p>
<p>So in a sense it doesn't matter what number you get to; it doesn't matter whether you get to 10. It only matters that you are clear about the number you are on at the moment. Take care of this moment, and all other moments will be taken care of. (Some counting methods only have the meditator counting up to 5, and that's also fine; the main issue is how clear you are at any count, at any present moment.)</p>
<p>It also doesn't matter how often your mind wanders or for how long or how deeply distracted you get. What matters is that once you realize it you use your ability to return. Like exercising, at first your ability may not be strong; but the more you use it the stronger it will become, until you are able to stay centered and present even when the outside world is in chaos.</p>
<p>In short, whether it's difficult or not is none of our business. Our job is to always return to the bare, unadorned moment.</p>
<p>Next, it is important not to change your method of meditation. As long as you are working with a good, time-honored method and understand its purpose, you should continue with that method. If some significant obstacle arises, you should still try to encounter that obstacle and break through with your own effort. This will make you stronger than if you always avoid obstacles.</p>
<p>Only if the problem means you can no longer apply your attention should you consider changing. At that point, seeking guidance from a clear and experienced teacher is most helpful.</p>
<p>If you keep changing the method when things get hard, then the thinking mind can overtake the process. The thinking (the ego or self-image that wants to keep from dissolving in meditation) will know that when a certain difficulty arises you will abandon the process and change to a different one; so therefore the thinking (or ego) will keep bringing up that difficulty and will keep getting you to change rather than see the process through to the end. On the other hand, if you just keep going no matter what — no matter whether you think you are doing well or poorly — then the thinking/ego will know that nothing can divert you from your practice, and eventually it will give up and settle, becoming quieter and quieter.</p>
