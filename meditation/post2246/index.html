  <h1>Any helpful tips for samatha home-retreat?</h1>

<p>Good luck on your retreat.</p>
<p>Food is an issue. It's remarkable how much time and effort can be taken up by meal prep, eating, and cleanup. If the retreat isn't including significant proportions of work periods, you should eat very simply and/or have things pre-made. I love my rice cooker on solo retreats; it will not only cook and reheat rice, but you can add another food either in with the rice or on a rack above it. Best of all, you don't have to keep checking it if it has an automatic shutoff or switch to warm.</p>
<p>Food that can be repurposed for a few meals is good. One grain can form the basis for a nice supper as well as a quick hot breakfast when reheated. You may also consider raw foods and hand foods. Some pre-chopped veggies and cheese or dip can work well. You get the idea. Planning ahead of time leaves more mental space later. Meals can be taken meditatively.</p>
<p>For sure, you should set a schedule and stick to it. This may mean doing a bit less than you might strive for at first, so that you will be sure to complete each day's schedule. You can adjust the time spent meditating according to your aspiration and ability, but there's a point where pushing is counter-productive, and you certainly wouldn't want to feel like you're failing if you come to a wall. In this respect, solo retreats can be more difficult than group retreats, because your own preference and habit still threatens to run the show, whereas you have no choice but to follow the schedule in group retreat.</p>
<p>So I suggest erring on the side of lightness, but absolutely sticking to your schedule. Then if you still happen to have the drive to sit during your scheduled off-time, you can do that by choice; but you won't be faced with the prospect of giving up if you find it's too much.</p>
<p>Basically, you want to eliminate as much opportunity for doubt to arise as possible; so set things ahead of time and <em>just do it</em>.</p>
<p>Walking meditation is an excellent practice in itself, and really comes into its own during retreat. Not only will you almost certainly be thankful for the chance to get up and move, it is a very good way of extending your concentration practice. This is because you can maintain a concentrated mind more easily over long periods if you have a chance to move and relax, without giving up the practice. On a subtle level it is also important to get a different perspective and to let energy move differently.</p>
<p>If you have the good fortune to be doing the retreat in a quiet area you can take a restful walk around the neighborhood or in a natural place, as long as you don't have encounters that will prime the thinking mind or otherwise take you out of retreat mode.</p>
<p>If you have a physical practice like prostrations, yoga, Taiji, or something similar you can do that first thing in the morning or a couple of times a day. Prostrations are very good practice, and are performed upon waking at many temples (usually at 3am or 5am).</p>
<p>In some temples there are four recommended daily practices: prostrations, chanting, mantra, and sitting meditation. This is in addition to walking meditation and work and eating practice. Starting the day by at least setting a compassionate intention is best, to remember and guide the direction of all your subsequent effort. A more fully fleshed-out morning ritual could take an hour or more: prostrations, a verse or impromptu speech honoring the Buddha or deity or your true mind, calling up great boundless compassion for all beings and dedicating your practice to their benefit, and doing a purification or repentance ritual to start the day completely renewed. These may be combined, for instance by doing refuge and repentance practice together with chanting and bowing at the same time.</p>
<p>But if you're not into ritual, it's very good to at least remember your <em>greatest, highest</em> intent at the start of the day, to bring a good direction to your retreat (i.e., to avoid any trace of grasping, self-centered attitude that will degrade your meditation and its results).</p>
<p>If during meditation you find yourself wavering either in wakefulness or commitment, you can stand up and continue your practice, or between sittings you can walk vigorously or even run. You can express yourself fully through these simple forms: sitting, standing, walking, running. If it helps, you can splash very cold water on your face and head. Sometimes washing the feet also helps.</p>
<p>As others have written, remove all distractions and even the hint of distractions. No electronics, no internet or games or entertainment. As far as reading or listening to talks goes, I personally wouldn't recommend it; there's too much opportunity for further discursive thinking, and it doesn't necessarily add much. You should already know your correct method, so only do it. Many retreats don't allow any reading or writing. Some allow only reading within the lineage of the training; and this is what I would recommend as well: if you're going to read, let it be from one consistent source that is aligned with your training. Best is to only read a single passage or phrase, and let it illuminate your practice.</p>
<p>It's important to let go of the notion that you need something from the outside. You are ready for retreat, so you are ready to own your practice. That means that you are the light for yourself during this time. Teaching has already come your way, and will come your way later; but at practice time, only practice. Don't think that there is something essentially missing. In retreat, people often turn to readings and Dharma talks as the last vestiges of entertainment available — something to 'break up the monotony'. But if there's monotony, let it go in the moment and refresh your momentary practice. Remember what you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Thank you for your practice!</p>
