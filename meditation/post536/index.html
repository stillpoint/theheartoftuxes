  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>"Has anyone ever...?" is such a misguided approach. We see it very often here, and it is an innocent mistake, but it is a wrong approach to learning. That's because it's so hit-and-miss. Even if you do happen to hear from someone with similar difficulties, it doesn't mean they have any real insight into remedies or into the correct process of meditation. And even if you happen to receive a very good response, how will you tell it apart from a <em>not</em> good response? Because you like it? Because you understand it? Because it feels good? Those are not necessarily the right basis for judging.</p>
<p>So asking this type of question is not the right easy to learn meditation; and these forums are not the right <em>place</em> to learn meditation.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I don't really feel like I am even meditating</em></p>
<p>This is checking -- stepping outside of <em>just doing it</em>, and trying to assess, judge, label, and manipulate your experience. That is not meditating, but checking. Checking is the biggest problem must people face in practice; it is the most common cause of difficulty.</p>
<p>Meditation doesn't depend on feeling. Good feeling doesn't equal good meditation. Bad feeling doesn't equal bad meditation. Don't attach to feeling. Don't attach to thinking.</p>
<p>So you must not check. Only <em>do</em> it.</p>
<p>That means you must know what you're doing and have faith in it. And <em>that</em> comes from learning one clear, proven method, and learning it from a clear, proven source -- someone who has fulfilled the practice in their own life, and who has been approved to teach. Then you can understand the reason for meditation, you can understand the correct method in all its details, and you can understand that when you apply the method correctly you will certainly get its results (as they've been attained and embodied in the teacher).</p>
<p>Thus, with the <em>why</em>, the <em>how</em>, and the appropriate <em>faith</em> in the method, you can give yourself over to the method. You can just do it, without getting sidetracked and derailed by doubt and checking.</p>
<p>When you wake up, it is indeed a very good time to practice. Part of this has to do with the energy cycles of the day as they appear in the bodymind. But for most people it is very significant and helpful because it immediately establishes their relationship to the day -- to mind, to life.</p>
<p>The way we start the day usually steers how the day will go. We are beset by mental habits that limit us and make us unhappy; but they slip in automatically, and we perpetuate them from the moment we wake up. But if in those first moments you intentionally, consciously <em>let go</em> of the automatic pattern, and instead apply your effort to clear presence, this steers the day in a very different, very good direction.</p>
<p>We dream and drift at night; then we wake from sleep and go right into our daytime dream of habitual patterns of thinking. Getting in there before the daytime dream takes hold is very helpful.</p>
<p>But if you check your practice, that is the daytime dream casting doubt on the process. Don't believe your dreaming-thinking mind. Only do correct practice. As I said above, that requires knowing what constitutes correct practice and being able to apply it. Only making assumptions, guessing, inventing your own, and gathering scattered ideas from scattered sources (including the many questionable sources here and at other online sites) -- that is not proper learning.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I have trouble meditating on a good day as I have unmedicated ADHD</em></p>
<p>This seems more the issue than the time of day. What kind of support are you getting for ADHD? What kind of lifestyle changes will help you settle and focus? When you can't change through your mind power alone (most of us can't), you never to regulate your basic life activities (eating, sleeping, physical activity and rest), your environment, your broader activities (what you consume with your eyes, ears, and thinking), and your relationships to help the mind settle and focus.</p>
<p>If the problem is that you are very dull and hazy when you wake, for one thing ongoing meditation practice can be a remedy for that -- but you have to <em>do</em> it. Besides that, you likely need to regulate your sleeping, eating, and physical activity (or inactivity). You may also need some healing for your central energy. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, dullness upon waking ('bag over the head' feeling) is a clear symptom of certain patterns of ill health, such as Spleen Qi deficiency (low central energy); and this can be treated by a combination of acupuncture, herbs, and the lifestyle corrections mentioned above.</p>
<p>Many yoga teachers can pass on good knowledge about healthy lifestyle. And the physical practices of yoga (there are many types) may also help with ADHD. Ongoing yoga classes from an accomplished teacher (not all teachers have deep experience) could be a great deal more helpful than trying to invent your own practice and trying to be your own teacher and guide, secluded from outside sources of wisdom.</p>
<p>In any case, if you are too dull or agitated, sitting meditation may be difficult or impossible for now. Often physical practices our other methods are necessary until the mind is calm enough to start meditating without fighting yourself. It's still a very good routine to do it as soon as you wake. Say, prostrations or yoga upon rising, and then some chanting or mantra or calm breathing.</p>
<p>Upon waking is not the only way by any means, but it's very good. Eventually, all of life should be clear and grounded in reality; so in your meditation career you may progress through first thing in the morning, to include last thing in the evening, then mid-day, then several times throughout the day, then day-long and week-long and month-long retreats, then three-year retreats, and then continuously non-stop through waking and sleeping.</p>
