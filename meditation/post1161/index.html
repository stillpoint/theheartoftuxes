  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'm so glad if my writing is of use.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why anxiety may become the default setting in our life; and it seems that anxiety is now an overarching reality for society at large. Just in the past half-year I am encountering more and more cases of  isolated anxiety or full-blown anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>I would say that if you are working with a supporter or guide, like a counselor, coach, therapist, meditation teacher, or practice facilitator, you should come up with a regimen together. Receive their advice, maybe try it for a while, and figure out whether it's a promising venture for you.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to interfere with someone who is there for you, and with whom you have the benefit of face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>But outside of that, I recommend physical practice. In general, getting vigorously physical is very good for smoothing out anxiety. As a practice, it can help bring your mind and energy down to its proper seat in the body.</p>
<p>Though many people find sitting meditation to be helpful, I find there's also the risk that it may bring an already anxious person in too close contact with their thinking, creating a feedback loop. With good instruction and practice container this can be overcome; but I find it more reliable to train with the body, and not confront the thinking so directly.</p>
<p>"Get out of the head and into the body."</p>
<p>Doing prostrations is a very good practice. It brings a settled clarity very quickly in comparison to other methods. It is a very vigorous practice, so one should develop the fitness for it gradually.</p>
<p>Free dance is also very wonderful. It not only smooths out the energy through physical exertion, but it gives one a chance to express things very sincerely, very precisely. The body can express energy and emotion in ways that can't be touched by words, for instance. And in the expression of your inner situation there's both a consciousness (i.e., you become more aware of the situation, and can identify it more readily when it appears in the future) and a letting-go. The very act of dancing is a moving on, which is empowering.</p>
<p>Many other physical activities can be healthy and helpful. Rhythmic, full-body-and-breath activities like running, swimming, rowing, cycling can have a somewhat meditative quality to them. Playful, unstructured activities like contact improv or authentic movement, embodied theater, tumbling, or games like hackysack or frisbee allow new pathways to open in the body, as it moves in ways outside of the ordinary patterned alignments.</p>
<p>Yoga, Taiji, Qigong, walking meditation — there are many ways of practicing with the body. What do you like?</p>
<p>As an ongoing way of grounding, I recommend 'feet on the ground' practice. It is maintaining a simple background awareness of your physical contact with the ground, from moment to moment. If you're standing or walking, you keep some awareness of the feeling of your feet contacting and being supported by the ground. If you're sitting, you maintain awareness of your butt on the chair and your feet on the ground. If you're lying down, you have some sense of the support of your body resting on the bed or sofa or floor. Whatever position you're in, you maintain some connection to <em>the place where you are</em> and the very faithful, almost mother-like support the ground gives you. Always there for you, always helping you to be <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>This mindfulness practice doesn't have to be intense. It doesn't have to be the only thing in your mind. As long as you have, say, 15% of your mind in your feet you can go about your day with presence and groundedness. You will be better more aware of the tension you hold, and will be able to let it go repeatedly. And you will have somewhere to let go <em>to</em> — you can let it pour downward with gravity, letting the earth take it.</p>
<p>At times when you want even stronger grounding you can bring more of your body down to the ground, and intentionally relax and let gravity take the tension down and out of you. You can lie on a blanket or bolster on the floor, or you can even lie down on the floor with some soft, heavy thing like a bolster or meditation cushion pressing you a little bit into the ground. That can be very comforting. Then you can emphasize settling into the place where you are. "I am here." You can feel the presence and safety of having this place.</p>
<p>So those are sort of adaptations of the same thing: using contact with the ground to bring you into the present moment with ease. If you want to try walking meditation you can do five or ten minutes morning and evening, feeling your feet contacting the ground. In this formal meditation you do focus more intently, to feel the actual sensations of the feet pressing, rolling, lifting, swinging. When distracted, just plainly return.</p>
<p>But most of the time it doesn't have to be that focused. You can talk or do your work or watch TV while keeping just a bit of background awareness in your contact with the ground.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>...would you say it's just a matter of relaxing those tight tense muscles people use to repress emotion?</em></p>
<p>It's a chicken-and-egg question: which came first? Often it's useful to start with the body. In traditional courses of meditation training, for instance, the body is trained very well to establish the basis of all that is to follow.</p>
<p>But we can't assume that body armoring is the cause or the only factor involved in repression. In many cases, some reflection and guidance for the mind is very, very helpful. We're often too close to our problems to see them clearly; and when a pattern is brought to our attention it can unlock a whole slew of new possibilities for us. So we can't make presumptions. There are many types of sickness and many types of cure, and not all of them go together. Some are broad, some are very specific.</p>
