  <h1>Okay so I just started meditation three days ago and my back is starting to really hurt.</h1>

<p>The postural muscles used in meditation are often underdeveloped in westerners. We aren't brought up sitting on the floor, and we habitually slouch and rely on external supports like chair backs, sofas, and cushions to keep us upright.</p>
<p>So the first point is that you may simply need to train the musculature for its task. This can be done just via more sitting meditation, or the process can be enhanced by focused exercises to build and stretch the appropriate muscles.</p>
<p>Some Yoga teachers have experience with sitting meditation postures, and can help with training. Thai massage is intended as an aid to meditation. The Korean martial art Sun Mu Do is aimed at preparing the body for long and intense meditation sessions. I can suggest postural exercises as well if you contact me.</p>
<p>Have you learned correct sitting posture in detail, or is it a hit-and-miss process so far? There are many resources online and out in the world. It would be helpful to understand some basics of meditation posture.</p>
<p>Your foundation should be firm. Bouncy pillows are usually no good. Folded blanket or small firm futon cushion is better. Knees should rest firmly on the ground; if they don't, then as a temporary measure higher cushions can be used until the knees can be seated firmly. But the cushions can only be raised to a point: the higher they are raised, the more the body teeters and the more the pelvis is pulled forward, creating a curve in the lower back. The hips need to be toned and stretched  so the knees can find their firm foundation without the need for much, or any, cushioning.</p>
<p>On this point, toning and stretching need to progress together. Only stretching may loosen the joints dangerously, destroying their integrity.</p>
<p>When sitting down, rock side to side and back and forth to find center. Some teachers recommend leaning far forward, lengthening the spine, and then rocking back into position.</p>
<p>The sit bones should be fairly vertical, so the lower back neither slumps forward nor back. <em>Usually</em>, a self-supporting posture is represented by a lower back with a slight inward curve, but not all bodies reproduce this.</p>
<p>The backs of the thighs should not be impinged by the edge of the cushion. People who sit far back on the cushion sometimes experience numbness from pressure on the nerves where buttocks and thighs meet.</p>
<p>The aim with the upper body is to lengthen and lighten rather than force it into ramrod straightness. Traditions vary as to postural requirements, and some schools will indeed put you into absolute straightness. The good part of this is that it builds your postural muscles; the bad part is that it soon hurts like heck and can introduce patterns of tension into not only the body but the mind as well. More commonly the guidance is to imagine being pulled up gently by the crown of the head. The back of the neck then flattens somewhat and the chin lowers and pulls in, in a relaxed way. Lifting from the crown helps put your face at a vertical whereas the common slumping posture has the face turned up at an angle, with the chin jutting out.</p>
<p>The more settled downward you are in body and mind, the lighter and more released the upper body can be. This can especially be experienced when standing: with feet hip-width apart and knees slightly bent, the more stress taken by the legs, the more release of tension experienced in the upper body. The Qigong practice of Zhan Zhuang is great training for this kind of radical, intentional relaxation and energy flow.</p>
<p>Back pain is experienced by almost every meditator who forges beyond a few minutes of practice. You need to identify whether it is a serious, injurious pain or whether it is "the suffering of practice". Sometimes you just have to bear with things.</p>
<p>Also be aware that the mind has a <em>huge</em> influence on both the posture and our experience of the body. Body and mind influence each other, one is expressed in the other; but mind is actually primary. You may eventually have the experience of settling into deep concentration, at which time — perhaps unbeknownst to you for a while — pains and strains in the body will be greatly relieved. Don't ask me how or why; others may be better versed in the workings of internal energy.</p>
<p>Even from the get-go you may experience how your concentration affects your posture (and vice versa). For instance, sometimes it can be difficult to maintain a nice circle with the arms and with the hand mudra — it keeps collapsing. But when the concentration is stronger, these circles hold <em>themselves</em> up. Very interesting! Likewise, <em>relaxation</em> and a non-grasping attitude can be reflected by reduced tension and pain in the body.</p>
<p>Noting where the pain arises can be a hint as to what is happening with the posture. Pain in the upper back sometimes means the head is too far forward or the shoulders are being drawn back forcefully. Pain in the mid-back could be the result of a slump or could indicate an emotional (heart) block or unwillingness that needs to be released. Pain in the lower back may have to do with the position of the pelvis and/or legs, especially if the spine is collapsed back in a slump or thrust too far forward.</p>
<p>Making changes in posture sometimes involves basic moves and sometimes very subtle interactions. You may help yourself by making changes gently and in small increments. In any case, don't get obsessed with finding the absolute perfect posture; your good-enough posture will generally come over time, and ultimately it will arise from deep in your mind: your meditation will do it. The self-attached mind fears boundlessness and seeks to establish definition and control; this is literally bodymind tension. As you progress in letting go of inner struggle, outer freedom emerges.</p>
<p>If you want to do more meditation and really can't bear to sit on the floor for longer periods, use a chair. Sit on the edge, with feet firm on the floor. If despite all efforts sitting is not working, do walking meditation: same mind practice, only while walking.</p>
<p>Vigorous physical activity before sitting can loosen the body and relax the mind so that the posture is much more natural. You can try bowing practice to avoid or relieve much of the pain of sitting.</p>
