  <h1>Conditioned patterns coming back after 3 years</h1>

<p>Our thoughts and actions create seeds that later unfold. When and how they unfold depends to a large extent on the conditions those seeds meet — the fields in which they come to fruition. You changed your conditions, so some seeds of your past thoughts and actions unfolded differently. Other seeds may have been in a holding pattern, waiting for just the right trigger to make them open. It seems that rap music was just such a trigger.</p>
<p>Now — this is important — although you don't know how many seeds are still waiting to emerge, and although you may have only a general idea of the kind of patterns you may have to deal with, <em>you still have a choice about how to deal with the unfolding.</em> You are not your habits or patterns or impulses or tendencies. They are all like a movie projected in your mind. Your mind doesn't have to attach to those stories, doesn't have to be controlled by them.</p>
<p>If you keep returning, with faith, to your positive thoughts and actions you will not only make new seeds of positivity and benefit, your old seeds will eventually get burned out. The old seeds will find no ground in which to ripen, and so little by little they will get used up. As they arise, you will feel that old anxiety and your thinking may start to turn toward negativity; but you can let those thoughts and feelings arise without losing your balance. You can keep your true way.</p>
<p>This is where meditation is so helpful. If you have a good method of meditation it will require you to keep returning to openhanded awareness, neither grasping at anything nor pushing anything away. You just stay with the object of meditation — the breath, or counting, or mantra, or candle flame, or whatever your method dictates. It is your returning that is so powerful. No special state is necessary. Feelings and thoughts can come and go; but you maintain your balance, returning to the method. That is how you save yourself.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you go on a mission to destroy the the thoughts and feelings that arise from old seeds, you have already become reactive to them and have lost your balance. You engage with the thoughts and feelings, add energy and importance to them, and create <em>new</em> seeds of fighting with yourself (which you will again have to deal with later). In this way, "the terrorists win", because you have let the old seeds determine your action.</p>
<p>So much better is to allow the thoughts and feelings to be what they are. No need to react to them, one way or another. This is called the blessing of <em>equanimity</em> — you train your ability to have a mind that is equal with everything. Like and dislike don't cause you to lose your balance; and if they do, you soon return. Because you have trained that returning through meditation.</p>
<p>So it is very much like dropping something from your hand. You may even want to take a glove or pillow or hackysack and just open your hand and drop it. Then repeat. Meditation is like this. It is not pushing away or fighting. If something appears in your hands again, just drop it again. Appear; drop. Appear; drop. Eventually, the seeds will get spent and won't appear as much. You may still have something from way back, waiting for the right ground and trigger to bring it out, but then you will know how to deal with it and you will have a very strong center, having returned to it again and again in meditation.</p>
<p>Inadequate feeling and approval-seeking thought and tendency is not you. This is just your karma, the fruits of past seeds. Since they are appearing as fruits they are already almost on their way out, almost finished. Let them finish, and just don't touch. Don't engage. Don't make new thought-seeds or reaction-seeds.</p>
<p>Let these things be here for a while and then move on. What <em>you</em> do in the meantime is just attend to the matter of the moment. If you are in meditation, only follow the method. If you are active in your daily life, only follow the situation facing you. What is in front of our nose? Where are your feet standing? That is what you attend to.</p>
