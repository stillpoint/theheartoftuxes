  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>How do you know what book or advice to choose, and in which situations to follow it, and what it actually means (rather than merely your current interpretation of it)?</p>
<p>As you train, your knowledge and perception are meant to change. If they don't, there's no progress. Realizing that we start from a place of ignorance, how can we assume that we are capable judges and interpreters? One mistake made in the beginning can become an ongoing misconception upon which entire mental and lifestyle structures are built. It becomes very difficult to tear them down later.</p>
<p>The reason people downvote these kinds of teachings is ego. The ego seeks control. The ego always wants to think of itself as the expert; it can't abide by humility.</p>
<p>And yet humility is a very essential quality in training. If one can't open to new teaching, how will new teaching enter? If one can't give up one's old views and preferences, how will one transform?</p>
<p>This and other online forums are gatherings of anonymous people with various levels of experience (including a great many dabblers) and a wide range of motives. And this mish-mosh of people are not speaking from a common basis -- all kinds of good and bad methods are being represented here, including many self-invented methods from self-anointed 'experts'. Reddit will attract those who like to talk more than those who commit to authentic practice. You should realize that this includes me as well! Look into what I'm saying, and see for yourself whether it makes sense. Don't just proceed based on a sense of authority.</p>
<p>Someone who is clear about the motive and causality of meditation may be able to use a book to start. Someone who is unclear, or attaches to words, or holds an opinion, will make obstacles from what is read in books. So it's not impossible to progress without a teacher, but it's far more likely you'll progress <em>with</em> a teacher; and at a certain level teaching becomes critical -- one's own views, habits, blind spots, and preferences can't be overcome by using the mind that clings to them; an unconditional guide is necessary, like a stable beacon.</p>
<p>Many years ago I started practicing meditating from a book. I was fortunate in that I stuck with one practice from one book; but unbeknownst to me, my blind spots and ego created obstacles that persisted for years and made future training difficult. Still, that was my path, and I can't say that it was a bad one.</p>
<p>You might make mistakes; you might learn improperly or ingrain bad habits; and yet that becomes your path. And if you keep going, the problems you create for yourself will also teach you. <strong>So I'm not saying that there is only one way. In saying there's a clear cause and effect to learning.</strong> The beginner has very little conception of <em>how</em> valuable a teacher is, and in how many ways. Those without experience have very little conception; they have only their fantasy and resistance to go on.</p>
<p>Ego's resistance to change is behind resistance to having a teacher. Ego wants control; it wants things to stay the same. So it is completely against meditative process! If we begin the process of softening mental barriers, paying attention to reality, and transforming our life, ego will put up obstacles. But it does it in a very clever way: by <em>appearing</em> to go along with the plan, <em>appearing</em> to be reasonable. </p>
<p>It will <em>seem</em> reasonable to invent your own favorite method in your own favorite isolated situation. It will <em>seem</em> reasonable to fear sinister influences from conniving teachers. But really these are just the ego's agenda to keep you isolated, so that nothing will ever change. In order to change, you need to expose yourself to newness. In order to change in a very specific, integral way, you need to expose yourself to specific, integral conditions.</p>
<p>The teacher has learned and accomplished the practice, and has been tested and verified by others. She or he is a living embodiment of presence, mindfulness, and the human expressions of these qualities (i.e., how mindfulness becomes wisdom in life activity and compassion in relationship). The teacher can teach through words, through actions, through in-person dialog, and through many subtle pathways like quality of presence -- countless ways that are missing when you merely read books.</p>
<p>The teacher can also organize the information for you, offer context, offer humanizing foundations (real-life situations), present the teachings in the proper order, offer feedback, offer encouragement, and quickly correct errors. All these are also missing when you merely read.</p>
<p>And perhaps most valuable: the teacher can take the teacher role, and you can completely be the student. You can dive into the practice, supported by a witness and guide, supported by a course of training and community and schedule, having the space held for you so that you can -- at the right time and in the degree that is reasonable for you -- surrender and <em>just do it</em>. Trying to be both student and teacher to yourself, you repeatedly switch roles and jump out of practice, giving rise to judging and doubting and other intrusive thought.</p>
<p>It's not that books can't be useful; but the cause-and-effect is clear. If the one who is still ignorant tries to be the teacher (and we see many cases of this on Reddit!), then ignorance is continued.</p>
<p>So how will you know what to follow?   </p>
