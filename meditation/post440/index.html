  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Tension can be transferred along the strap-like muscles by the spine, originating from as far down as the pelvis. The sitting base should be firm and the body stacked up in a relaxed alignment on top of it.</p>
<p>For example, if the pelvis is not raised slightly relative to the knees, the knees will often lift up, requiring a counterbalance through muscular tension. The lower back will curve out, hunching the back. The shoulders and head will counterbalance <em>that</em> by jutting forward. This puts tension on the muscles along the spine, up the neck, and into the jaw as well as over the scalp to the brow.</p>
<p>Any jutting forward of the head will likely be the cause of stress, which eventually builds to pain. The head it quite heavy (on average just under 5kg or 10 - 11lbs), so if it's not balanced well atop the spine it can create considerable tension.</p>
<p>In light of this, the common instruction is to "pull the chin inward". But this is such a heavy-handed, uninformative instruction that it can create as many problems as it solves. Without understanding the reason <em>why</em>, many meditators pull the chin inward just because they are told to. This can create just as much, if not more, tension in the neck and jaw as well as destroying the supportive curve of the neck.</p>
<p>Really posture should follow feeling; if the meditator is not lucky enough to achieve ease naturally (perhaps because she/he has been used to sitting on the floor since childhood), they need to develop the sensitivity to feel how adjustments change the patterns of tension in the body. The posture should be awake but at ease; and physically this means that the body is upright (not 'straight' but following the natural supportive curves of the spine) and stacked upon itself in a way that requires the least muscular effort to maintain.</p>
<p>A perhaps more useful image is to picture oneself suspended from a string at the crown of the head. (But if one pictures the string in the wrong place and only follows the image rather than the effortless feeling of suspension, it could turn out in an unbalanced posture anyway.)</p>
<p>An image that I've found useful is to 'sit like a mountain': the base completely solid and very settled, all tension sunken and dissipated into the ground, and the upper part wafting upward in graceful nobility, like Mount Fuji. When the base is right, what's upon it can have less tension.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge the role of the mind in physical manifestations. Even without misalignment, pain can often arise because of the way the mind is used. The mentality should be open, accepting, and gentle. Our ego-driven habit, and the general thrust of our society, is to focus on a desired object and try to grasp it. This is not the correct mindset for meditation. Although an object may (or may not) be used for meditation, the mindset should have equanimity. The presence should not be grasping but rather openhanded.</p>
<p>If one is particularly driven to 'succeed' by gaining a certain state, or if one is too bent on attaining contact with the object of meditation, the same pattern of tension can arise in the hands, arms, shoulders, neck, brow, and jaw as would arise when one is physically reaching for or wrestling with it. It's as if the eyes and hands are desperately keening forward.</p>
<p>The hands, eyes, and jaw are our most active interfaces for control. These are the parts of the bodymind that are habitually overused, utterly out of balance with the rest of the bodymind. If we had a picture of our energy use in place of the physical body we would see enormous hands, eyes, jaws, and brain, and a shriveled or non-existent rest of the body. It is out of balance. So meditation in part restores balance. Everything is made equal. Relaxed hands, relaxed eyes, relaxed jaw, relaxed brain... and groundedness, inhabiting the rest of the body, and softly, openly allowing all events to appear and disappear in their own way and in their own time.</p>
<p>The jaw and mouth are our most primal areas of control. Before an infant even knows what to do with its hands, its mouth finds its mother. The mouth and jaw become the portal between self and universe, need and nourishment. This relationship runs deep in the psyche. Many issues of control manifest in the jaw. Intentionally bringing kindness and ease to that area may be necessary, time and again, to overcome habitual clenching. Some people are even prone to grinding the teeth during the day or in their sleep.</p>
<p>The pelvis and the organs situated around it also tend to develop a sympathetic closure or control habit, which is all the more reason to start with a solid, relaxed base. If the bottom of the torso is clenched, the mouth and jaw will tend to mirror it.</p>
<p>Have you learned proper posture from a good source? Getting ongoing guidance from a teacher can be very helpful, if not invaluable.</p>
<p>You can check my posting history for posts on posture. I've written many times and in detail about meditation posture in its various forms, and the kinds of supports and other options that may be helpful.</p>
<p>Try out a few sessions armed with the new knowledge (if it is new to you). If you want to explore further, I recommend learning a way of becoming sensitive to body alignment. Alexander Technique, Feldenkreis, and Mitzvah Technique have been found useful by many meditators.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue is strength, or strength in combination with flexibility. If the core muscles are not firm enough to support the spine easily, the collapse can lead to the pattern of tension I mentioned above. Some methods that can train strength well for sitting are Pilates, Taiji, and Yoga, though the specific teachers or classes may vary widely in expertise or applicability to your situation.</p>
<p>Other possible etiologies have to do with buildup, blockage, or deficiency of energy. These are of course closely tied to the ways you use both your physical and mental faculties. If the attitude is not openhanded, energy can build up. If there is overthinking and lack of groundedness in the body, energy can get stuck in the head. If there is tension somewhere along the paths of circulation (often in the shoulders or upper back), energy can be blocked and locally deficient or excessive in the head. Basically, tension and pain are associated with a lack of flow. There may be several reasons behind the lack of flow. Unbalanced (forced or held) breath may also play a role.</p>
<p>In some cases, messing around with energy-based meditations without proper guidance can lead to rising heat and tension or pain. There are many preliminaries to be completed before doing energy practice, including proper diet and certain lifestyle guidelines as well as understanding the practice well and following it through meticulously and with the correct motivation.</p>
