  <h1>Too focused on the length of each sit</h1>

<p>Did I say it was unfruitful? I said there's a point where stagnation tends to set in. There may be benefit in continuing through stagnation; and there may be benefit in undertaking another practice or activity to quickly shed the stagnation and then re-apply oneself to the meditation. It depends on the situation and on the constitution of the practitioner. Some practitioners have unflinching connection to deeper absorptions, or tremendously bright aspiration. It is extremely uncommon for this to be the case for beginners. Stagnation is often not an issue for these people, even in extreme practice durations. But one's relationship with stagnation often depends as much on the body and energetic constitution as on the mental intent.</p>
<p>I've heard reports of stagnation from practitioners of many years as well as guidance about it from teachers of various traditions, so I don't take it as merely an idea or tradition-based mindset.</p>
<p>There is also the situation at more advanced levels where meditation continues even through dozing and sleep. The approach here does differ according to tradition, and what we see as the outer sign (of nodding off, for example) is not necessarily an indication of the level of practice being performed, as one practitioner may indeed be drifting while another is maintaining a deep connection. But it is very often the case that dozing, drifting meditators think they are doing well when in fact they're confusing the comfort of half-sleep with the calm and even-minded nature of meditative attainment.</p>
<p>One goes to retreat and tries longer sittings <em>despite</em> the dulling effect; in part, for the reasons you offer: to practice discipline, to extend the range of what is possible and what is comfortable, to apply oneself more strenuously than common, to generate bright awareness regardless of the conditions, to merge practice and moment-to-moment life, and so on. But all that doesn't negate the fact that for many (perhaps most) meditators, there's a point past which stagnation tends to set in. That's usually around the 40 minute mark. Meditators used to a plodding practice will not notice it so much. This isn't opinion; it has been reported by many high-level practitioners; so maybe let's investigate what they're talking about rather than reacting to the fact that it sounds like a contradiction to our usual opinion or custom.</p>
<p>Discipline is for what? That is, what is the correct  purpose of discipline? "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." There is a right relationship with discipline and a wrong relationship with discipline. The right aim is essential.</p>
<p>For those firmly in a practice setting or otherwise able to digest difficulty through practice, increasing one's effort and discipline is beneficial. But not for the sake of discipline alone. The discipline is in service of something. What is that? That is the central point: how do you serve what needs to be served?</p>
<p>For many beginners and even many people who've been meditating for a while without a strong structure of teaching, guidance, support, schedule, companionship, and life systems around them, pushing is counter-productive. We see so many cases of people starting out fast, out of sincere aspiration, but quickly becoming discouraged — often to the point of giving up completely. The self-blame and alienation from practice can continue long after the original discouragement, and can even contribute to a pattern of negative striving and discouragement in future attempts at practice. The pattern is often continued throughout heroic efforts to do more, more, more.</p>
<p>There is no formula as to the best approach, the best duration. There is just cause and effect. So the best approach depends on the mind and situation of the practitioner. Some people respond very well to difficulty. I practiced alongside a complete beginner when we undertook the practice of 10,000 prostrations in a single day. I had done prostration practice for quite a while already, but he was completely new to it. His pure aspiration — his beginner's mind — carried him through.</p>
<p>But this is perhaps more rare than the usual case, as others become completely crushed by repeated discomfort at a time when they have not yet tasted the benefit of content and stable practice. It is exacerbated in those who are sensitive, reactive, prone to distractione, etc. In their cases it is important to nurture the contentment and stability until these qualities are well digested. That then provides the proper <em>basis</em> for striving.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to keep conveying good teaching, so the beginner can keep clarifying the right application of discipline, and practice doesn't become 'going through the motions'. The path comes from the center: actual discipline ultimately sprouts from the Way-seeking mind, not from outside imposition.</p>
<p>I agree with what you are saying, and I don't think what we're each talking about is necessarily contradictory. It's important to see the essential point and not get hung up on words and forms.</p>
