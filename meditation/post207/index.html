  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/4vh1mr/how_to_deal_with_extreme_laziness_and_low/d5yd8mw/">previous post</a> in its entirety:</p>
<p>&gt; If it were <em>only</em> a matter of motivation, that would be addressed by awareness of death, awareness of the preciousness of life, and recognition of the inevitable suffering of <em>Samsara</em> (our 'ocean of suffering' situation together with other beings because we are mistaken about our true self and where happiness is derived).
&gt; 
&gt; We lack motivation in practice because we are not clear on <em>Samsara</em> -- we do not recognize and fear its endless suffering as we ought to, and we still believe it can bring us some happiness, which it cannot.
&gt; 
&gt; But often laziness and avoidance are not only matters of motivation. Much of the time emotional issues like depression are implicated in the pattern. Only pushing oneself to live up to a standard may not get at the cause of the pattern, and in many cases fails to have lasting effect.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, many spiritual seekers are particularly prone to procrastination. They tend to be sensitive perfectionists, with a heightened sense of responsibility. Failure to live up to expectations weighs harder on them than most people, and a push-pull develops between their ideals and standards on one hand, and the mind that requires freedom on the other. 
&gt; 
&gt; Constant inner pressure to perform, to 'be a good student' or 'good person' is exhausting; and when the mind seeks respite and unstructured flow, one blames oneself. This blame then adds to the mental pressure; it's a vicious cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet another cause for avoidance is the ego's fear of dissolution. (These causes tend to be enmeshed and overlapping, all of them present to some degree at the same time.) We have an incredibly deeply ingrained self-image and habit of control-seeking. Almost with our every waking breath we seek control over how things will turn out. (Video games play strongly into our control-seeking habit, and greatly increase it.) So when we begin to enter meditation, which requires us to let go of control, let go of grasping, and which brings us into a new boundless and open sense of self, our egoic habit-mind freaks out. It's a very similar reaction to that of a terrified, screaming child being brought to kindergarten for the first time: "I don't want to goooooooo!!"
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So the matter is usually not one-sided. <strong>Understanding</strong> is required: understanding both of the cause-and-effect stream of one's own mental patterns, and intimate understanding of one's situation amid impermanence, immanent death, and <em>Samsara</em>. Rationality and proper learning counteract knee-jerk defensive/avoiding reactions of the habit mind.
&gt; 
&gt; <strong>Discipline</strong> is required: a reasonable schedule of activity that matches one's capacity, and that is followed regardless of one's whim or one's judgment of progress. In almost all cases external support in the forms of a living teacher, practice group, practice setting, schedule, and gradually progressive vows and commitments are required to build a discipline that goes beyond the ups and downs of mood and self-judgment. If "I" try to lead my own practice, all my misunderstandings and habits are also put in the leader role.
&gt; 
&gt; And <strong>compassion</strong> is required, to establish a lively, safe, fertile mental and emotional environment. Without compassion, mere understanding and discipline are too 'dry'; they soon wither or crumble under stress. With self-love we are inspired to continue with courage, as opposed to resisting the things we coldly push upon ourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; ~
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest this for all practitioners, but it seems particularly apropos in your case: Your first waking moments are critical. Your day will tend to go as your first moments go. If you begin your day unconsciously following habit, that will be the momentum of your activity throughout the day. If you begin your day by immediately connecting with your highest aspiration, your greatest human purpose -- and then immediately doing something to act on that aspiration -- then you will not be dragged down in habit as easily. Your day will begin with joy and self-celebration rather than self-blame.
&gt; 
&gt; So try this: on your first moment of waking in the morning -- regardless of the time -- bring Buddha into yourself. Call to, welcome, and connect with the Buddha's light, his compassion and wisdom and clarity. Buddha was a person just like you (like all of us), struggling with life, dissatisfied. He was just like you, but he eventually attained great enlightenment. Call on Buddha's great enlightenment in your moment of waking, either connecting to the enlightening energy in the world or to your own inherent awakening nature. They are the same. The moment of waking up in the morning is a very beautiful time to do this! You can connect your day's waking up to your life's waking up.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine, a great Zen nun and master, even encourages opening your arms wide and 'giving Buddha a hug'. As you do it, you find that you are giving yourself a hug: originally and ultimately, Buddha is you.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, quickly get up, go to the washroom and splash water on your face, and rush to your place of practice, your sitting mat or carpet or chair, and start morning practice. Do it quickly and without giving any room for doubt or resistance. Express yourself, express your aspiration vividly. The <em>way</em> you move is as important as getting from place to place. Do it with single-minded focus. From the moment you wake, be vigilant for habitual thoughts and tendencies, and don't let them take over this gift you give yourself. This is a very good way of starting the day.
&gt; 
&gt; If you find that thoughts and habits begin to interfere regardless of your effort, never mind. Only do it! Take yourself to your sitting place, even if other thoughts and feelings come up. You can replace them with thoughts of aspiration, with enjoyment and gratitude <em>that you are actually doing it</em>, and in any case, if you continue to put one foot in front of the other to take yourself to your mat, no thought or feeling can stop you.
&gt; 
&gt; You may want to begin your practice even as you rise. If you do mindfulness of breath or mantra or whatever, start it in bed even before your eyes open. Continue as you throw the covers off, splash water, and move to your practice place. You get a 'running start' -- you are already doing it, leaving no gap for negativity to enter.
