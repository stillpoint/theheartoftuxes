  <h1>I still don't know which is the right method</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I still don't know which is the right method</em></p>
<p>The thing about asking an open-ended question like this is that people here will respond in many different, and sometimes conflicting, ways. Some will respond from their experience, which varies in style, quantity, and depth; others will respond from what they've read; and yet others will offer opinions. Speculation and misunderstanding easily find their way into even the most well-intentioned responses.</p>
<p><strong>There is no <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em>, there is only what is appropriate or not for a particular situation.</strong> Although you're not asking specifically about Buddhism, this is a hallmark of Buddhist teaching: it varies according to the seeker's situation — his or her mental and emotional constitution, life situation, level of understanding, receptivity to the teaching, will toward effort, and strength of aspiration. Within and outside of Buddhism, there are methods that suit the vast majority of people, and there are methods that are much more narrow and focused on particular situations or specific difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>So the first point is this: it is important to know where you're starting from and where you want to go.</strong> Your situation and the interest or motivation that is moving through you naturally should determine the type of meditation you practice.</p>
<p><strong>The next point is that a practice of any significant depth <em>will</em> require your involvement.</strong> It's not like receiving a massage or manicure. Maybe it's more like swimming or skiing: you can enjoy it and be refreshed by it, and it can even become effortless in a way, but you have to continually add your own attentiveness and activity to keep it moving. If a practice is too easy, it will make your indulgence and laziness grow. Or if you look at it from the other side, a practice that avoids challenging your old habits and stuck patterns will not be able to help you much. So <strong>good practices will always have some difficulty involved</strong>, because that's where the growth is. (That's not to say that if it's difficult it's necessarily good.)</p>
<p>Many meditations are possible for you; but you have to choose one and do it. <strong>Changing from style to style or from method to method can't help you grow, because it allows you to skirt the issue of surrender.</strong> Concentration means surrender, relinquishment. You give up everything but the matter at hand: the object of attention. Our mind habit is just the opposite, always flitting and flying away to something else. It is sometimes referred to as <em>monkey-mind</em> — the mind that is like a hyperactive monkey always jumping from tree to tree, clutching fruits it doesn't need, chasing this or that new thing. So a large part of practice is the repeated letting go of monkey mind and returning to the object of attention. It appears a thousand times, you relinquish it a thousand times. But if you always change the method or object of attention whenever it gets difficult or uncomfortable, then you never get to relinquish — and you never get to the calm, settled comfort on the other side of surrender/relinquishment. So choose a method and stick to it for a while until it starts to work on you; they you will have a better idea of whether it is in fact a good fit for your situation, because your assessment will not only be coming from your monkey mind.</p>
<p>Note that many of the practices that we call "meditation" are not in fact true meditation; they are more appropriately called concentration (or, in some cases, visualization, inquiry, or others). <strong>True meditation means a completely open and present mind that doesn't move in any direction.</strong> It is sometimes referred to as choiceless awareness. There is no moving toward or away from any thought, feeling, event, or state. Because of the ingrained monkey mind habit, many people find it difficult to find or stay with their open and unmoving awareness; so concentration practice (focusing and a particular object) is assigned.</p>
<p>You should not conceive of meditation as trying to eliminate thinking. If that were the case, then a rock would be the best meditator, and you would have the best chance by being asleep or in a coma. <strong>Your correct relationship with thinking is not to eliminate it, but rather not to be attached to it.</strong> Let it be without letting it move you — without following the thoughts that appear. (You relinquish them and return to either open awareness or, if you are doing concentration style, to the object of awareness.)</p>
<p>Since your voiced aims are concentration and relaxation, I would tend to agree with <em>ironweaver</em> that following the breath could be a good practice for you. Following the breath or "listening to" the movement of the breath in your body has the following benefits for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is innately gentle and soothing. The tidal movement of breathing and the sound of the breath both have calming and healing properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a physical root, bringing you into your body rather than your thinking or envisioning mind or dramatic heart. This will also tend to settle you and help you stay closer to a normalized experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The breath is a very sensitive feedback machine; it will reflect the state of your mind and help you be aware of when you need to settle and let go more. (Don't try to control the breath! Regulate the breath by letting go of your mind and letting it all be. When you let go of grasping for a particular state, the breath will settle by itself.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming familiar with the breath will stand you in good stead for progress in other meditations that proceed beyond mere relaxation and concentration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;<em>...does the position of the hands really relevant in the whole process?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it is relevant. But you won't see the relevance for yourself until your mind becomes more calm and aware. When the mind is agitated, only very gross and obvious effects are perceived. Once awareness starts to grow, you may see that certain lifestyle issues or behaviors are influencing your mind: drinking coffee or eating too much sugar or meat, adopting slouching postures, hanging out with unclear or agitated people, and so on. Later, when the mind has become even more aware, then you can see how even the slightest changes in posture or activity affect not only your mind but those around you.</p>
<p>But as your awareness and sensitivity grow, there should (and likely will) also be a growth in your stability and centeredness; so even though you become aware of more and more influences, you become less and less susceptible to being thrown off by them. You actually become stronger and more able to move in all kinds of situations and relate to all kinds of people.</p>
<p>But to get back to your question, yes, there are energetic and psychosomatic reasons for the positions of your hands in meditation. If you want to test it, just try clenching your fists and jaw for a while, and see how that affects your mind and mood. Or push your hands out flat in front of you (in a "stop!" posture) and open your mouth and eyes wide, and see what changes that posture produces. Or stand with your feet spread wide, your chest out, and your hands on your hips. It will be difficult <em>not</em> to perceive a change in mood and energy when taking different postures. The hand postures (called <em>mudras</em>) in meditation have effects that reach deeply into the mind, and that influence your practice in subtle and specific ways.</p>
<p><em>However,</em> even though this connection exists, and even though at the beginning it is best to be as correct as possible in every aspect of your form (posture, method, and breathing), it is also <em>okay</em> to use all kinds of postures and forms, as long as you have the right relationship with your mind. Mind is the leader; everything follows from mind. Outside things can support practice, but practice doesn't depend on outside things.</p>
<p>Good?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some possible hand positions, each of which are okay but which have specific influences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cosmic mudra: left hand over right hand, with second knuckles aligned; form a gentle circle with the thumbs touching; hands rest in the lap</li>
<li>left hand resting over right hand, forming an open-hand or bowl shape that rests in the lap</li>
<li>hands folded together (fingers interwoven), resting in the lap</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other postures are available, but these have the dual benefits for your situation of gathering energy or focus inward and settling downward. Other classic hand postures will be more dispersed or uplifted, which — although okay — may work at cross-purposes to your aims of settling and focusing. An experienced teacher with more information about your situation may find that another posture would be useful.</p>
