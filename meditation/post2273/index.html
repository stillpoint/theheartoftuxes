  <h1>Inexperienced meditator here; looking for advice on some things.</h1>

<p>Thank you for your sincere reply. I hear that you want to understand yourself, get benefit in your life, and gain companionship. I feel that you are open to receiving teaching, and that is very wonderful.</p>
<p>You also talk about the pattern of breaking down when things get tough. I think this is something that almost all of us can relate to. The ability to do things on willpower alone is extremely uncommon. So on the one hand, understanding and compassion are necessary; and on the other hand, building the conditions that will support your practice is necessary. More on that below.</p>
<p>Understanding yourself is a great goal. Taken all the way, as an aspiration to fully awaken to your true nature, this is called middle-level motivation — to gain complete enlightenment for yourself. High-level motivation is to gain complete enlightenment for all beings.</p>
<p>All problems come from not understanding oneself. All personal problems, and all problems in the world come from that. Nations and cultures are separated and don't live in harmony; our societies, neighborhoods, and families are divided and fighting among each other; and even within ourselves parts of us are fighting against other parts. We know something, but don't act on it; we feel something, but cover it up with thinking; we wish something, but hold our bodies and relationships in ways that won't support it. All of this comes from not understanding our true self.</p>
<p>All correct meditation points at your own true mind. (That's not to say that everything people call 'meditation' is correct!) But there is one method followed across cultures and religions that uses the motivation to understand oneself as the very method: self-inquiry. Self-inquiry uses a big question to free the mind. It doesn't try to make anything, but rather looks or listens openly. I can describe the practice and offer some resources if you are interested. I believe it is a much more appropriate practice for you, and more capable support will be available than what you can get with tulpaforcing.</p>
<p>Making a tulpa is — traditionally — an ability exercised by extremely advanced practitioners, beings who have already established their life direction firmly, have developed great unfailing compassion, have made and kept profound vows of practice and behavior, and have attained exceptionally advanced abilities. Taking the practice out of its context is, in my opinion, very misguided. One doesn't find oneself by making an illusory self, but by progressively letting go of all illusions. Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>A big question makes space in the mind for things to be what they are. It's like letting go of a car's steering wheel once you've made a turn, so the wheels can return to neutral by themselves. Or it's like rebooting a computer or pressing "clear" on a calculator, so the machine can function from its correct starting point. So you can use your big question "Who am I?" to clear away the noise and let things be what they are. Then truth appears by itself.</p>
<p>Your answer to why you eat every day is common, but needs to be clarified. It is appropriate that it doesn't quite make sense yet; this is a question that gets clarified over the course of your practice and your life. It may be years before you deeply understand the meaning. In the meantime, your answer is the same as many people's answers, and also the same as an animal answer: <em>I eat to live, and because I like it.</em> With practice and clarification, your answer will become: <em>I eat for you and all others. I live in order to practice, gain enlightenment, and help all people and all beings.</em> That is a true human-being answer, an expression of highest potential. In the meantime, it is good that you just look into it and answer sincerely.</p>
<p>As I wrote above, because of our unclear motivation and wavering activity — sometimes we go strong, sometimes we give up — understanding, compassion, and building supportive conditions are all necessary. If you keep mindful of these three points you can help yourself be consistent in practice and get what you're seeking. Behind it all, the issue of motivation must be continually clarified: why do I eat; what is my life for?</p>
<p>We need to understand that practice will have ups and downs. Sometimes we feel winning, sometimes we feel losing. That doesn't matter. We mustn't attach to up and down, but keep going, keep going. If you know ahead of time that there will be times that feelings dip and results are hidden, you can avoid being thrown off. Only continue, not depending on seeing particular results or feeling particular things.</p>
<p>Next, compassion is necessary. We have to be realistic about our stage of development, and learn how to encourage and forgive ourselves. The intention is to do well, but when we slip off the path we have to find a way to return quickly. Self-blame does not help us return; it takes us further from the path. So quick self-forgiveness and quick return are important.</p>
<p>And finally, building supportive conditions is necessary. We can't do it by willpower alone, so we need a structure around us that will support our effort until we are able to take it on by ourselves. That supportive structure includes having a consistent daily schedule, developing healthy habits (sleeping, eating, exercise), maintaining contact with good teaching — so, finding and studying with a good teacher, finding and practicing with a community of sincere seekers, and limiting bad or unclear teaching influences. If we really can't do it ourselves, then we have to submit to a structure that will help us, which may mean attending retreats or even doing residential practice where we are guided every step of the way by a teacher and/or schedule, and the whole day is aimed at resolving our big question.</p>
<p>If you are interested in self-inquiry I can pass you more information.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
