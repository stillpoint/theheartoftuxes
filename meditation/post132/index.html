  <h1>Does "watching thoughts" mean being aware of thoughts or is it something more?</h1>

<p>I'd like to make some suggestions, and you can decide for yourself whether they apply to your situation.</p>
<p>First, there needs to be a <strong>balance between motivation and form</strong>. Your interest and energy have gone charging out of the gates, which is wonderful; but they have to be accompanied by a gradual growth of understanding, development of character, and consistent application of form.</p>
<p>You're not going to finish the job within a week by going out fast, but you may very well overextend yourself and then become disappointed. Also, few people can make much progress by putting a lot of pressure on themselves, but even if they do there's a price to be paid in terms of the resentment and rebellion of the mind that has been put under pressure. Reactionary thoughts and behaviors can arise, and shadow material (the parts of the self that have been stuffed away into unconsciousness) can grow.</p>
<p>Two points will be more significant for your development: <strong>relaxation into openhandedness</strong>, and <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>
<p>The former means that <em>you</em> don't do your practice — you don't create awakening, because your true nature already <em>is</em> awakening. <strong>The gaining idea has to be dropped</strong>, the plan of making something in particular happen has to be abandoned. You give yourself over to Big Mind rather than trying to do it yourself.</p>
<p>The latter means that <strong>small gains over the course of weeks, months, and years</strong> take hold more firmly and in a more integrated way than you will achieve by pushing hard and then giving up.</p>
<p>Next, you should know that <strong>checking is the main problem in spiritual practice</strong>. I've written about this in many <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/2b1rev/how_do_i_use_wu_wei_in_an_mma_fight/cj1h8n2">previous comments</a>. The practitioner must let go of the mind-habit that always seeks to pin down what's going on, how should things be, how do they compare, how one feels, and so on. Of course as a beginner there will be many questions and many things to be learned, but you should get into the rhythm of <em>just doing it</em> sooner rather than later, and avoid this habit of checking, tweaking, obsessing, and trying to control the mind.</p>
<p>So for you, both since you show a predilection for checking and since you don't have a teacher or supporting structure to guide you away from self-obsession, I don't think it's a good practice to always try to be aware of your thoughts. It entails too much self-involvement and checking.</p>
<p>Better for you would be to <strong>just do vipassana when it's time to meditate</strong>, and <strong>keep a relaxed mindfulness at other times</strong>. Relaxed, everyday life. Don't try to make something special, and don't try to be someone special.</p>
<p>If you want an anchor to help you stay mindful, a <strong>body-based anchor</strong> will, I believe, help you much more than a thinking anchor. Get out of your head and into your body. That will help you stay in reality rather than spin out with all these questions and speculations. There are many body-based anchors and many methods possible. I recommend feeling your physical foundation: when standing or walking, feel your feet on the ground; when sitting, feel your butt on the seat and your feet on the ground; and when lying down, feel your body's contact with the bed or other support. In short, feel where you are, in a real, physical, grounded way.</p>
<p>This doesn't have to be intense or burdensome. It can happen in the background as you do your tasks and enjoy your life. 5% or 10% of your mind can be aware of your contact with the ground as you go about your day. If at times you have opportunity for more focused attention, you can practice relaxing and letting go into that rootedness, as if letting gravity take away your tension and concerns. If you practice this consistently, I think you will see why it is good for you in your situation.</p>
<p>When practicing vipassana, <strong>follow the vipassana method meticulously</strong>. It is a good, proven method. It is not the only method, but it is the one you have chosen, and it is quite effective enough to take you all the way to awakening. If you go away from the method, it is like saying that your own whim is more important than the aim of the practice, and that your own fleeting idea is more significant than the wisdom of those who have passed down the method.</p>
<p>Following the method precisely becomes your teacher when a human teacher is not present. By following the method you provide yourself a clear mirror for seeing your own mind. You get to see the ways you try to control, avoid, compromise, cheat, force, spice up, go to sleep, and so on. (Like all of us!) It is important that you have this clear mirror. If you don't follow the method precisely, the mirror becomes unclear and you start to fool yourself about practice and about your own mind. Ignorance gets the upper hand. So when doing vipassana, just do vipassana, don't add your own ideas of practice and don't combine instructions from various sources.</p>
<p>Seeing space between your thoughts is not necessary. It has become a popular way of teaching meditation, and some will even claim that it is the key to realizing your mind, but it is not necessary. Your clear mind is already there, and it embraces everything. When silence appears, fine; when activity appears, fine. Everything is no problem. Only keep your groundedness, relax, and be openhanded, letting everything come and go.</p>
<p><strong>Trying to make or hold on to clarity or certain feelings is a mistake</strong>.</p>
<p>Thinking about whether you should feel relief or whether thoughts should be there is just more checking. Relax, open your hands, and let things find their own way. Thoughts too — any thought can come, stay, or go; no problem. You are the space in which they come and go; that is the important point.</p>
<p>Also <strong>don't check when thoughts take you away</strong>. Like most of us, because of your karma there will indeed be times when you get caught up in thoughts. It's not something you can eliminate from the start and never have happen again. <strong>The important part is how quickly and fuss-free you can return</strong>. "Don't cry over spilt milk." When thoughts catch you, never mind how, why, how long, how bad, and so on; only return. As soon as you notice you've gone away — whether it's been a few seconds or a few weeks — quickly return either to your vipassana practice if you're meditating, or to awareness of your foundation (feet on the floor) if you're going about your day.</p>
<p>To repeat: Don't check your getting caught; that's the inevitable result of past patterns. Only return quickly and without further drama.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your approach should be openhanded, relaxed, and consistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't check your condition or situation; only do what you're doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wander away, return to the present moment immediately and without much fuss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow your chosen method meticulously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Good?</p>
