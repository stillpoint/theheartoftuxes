  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>...what do you mean by the cosmic mudra being the cosmos? All it seems to be arbitrary hand positioning. I've seen people meditate just sitting with hands on their laps or with their hands clasped, fingers crossed.</em> </p>
<p>When we speak of our common perception, our common use of language is sufficient. When we speak of higher perception, words and thoughts break down; and in order to use words at all we are often required to have a more poetic engagement with them.</p>
<p>Our common perception is that we are small, separate beings living in an external world of separate beings and objects. We think "this is me, over here, and that is a chair, over there", etcetera. But both science and direct meditative experience tell us this view is false. Our physical existence is utterly interconnected with everything else, and it is all shifting, vibrating, evolving, appearing-and-disappearing. It is all ungraspable. At the quantum level of the basic makeup of matter, if we point to what we consider an elementary particle of matter we can fix it in space but not in time, or we can fix it in time but not in space; things can be said to have location but not time, or time but not location. Not to mention that the very particles themselves are not at all fixed, but rather best understood in terms of their <em>probability</em> of being in any place at any time.</p>
<p>There are many, many other examples of the highest science becoming poetic as it tries to express reality. Both science and direct meditative seeing reveal a reality that is boundless, ever-changing, and ungraspable. But this is not how we commonly see the world. We don't take science to heart, but rather keep thinking of ourselves as separate, set, individual beings. Even if we consider something we can experience quite plainly, our growth from baby to adult, we can see that there is no one thing we can point to as a set, separate self. It is only because we have attachment to 'my' name and the idea of 'myself' that we are stuck in the view of a universe of separately existing objects.</p>
<p>Mudra is a shape that expresses a certain aspect of reality. Body and energy (or if you prefer, <em>feeling</em> or <em>inner expression</em>) are embodied together. Body and mind are one.</p>
<p>Mudras are both sublime expressions of perfected states of being as well as tools for practicing and <em>achieving</em> perfection of those states of being. A Bodhisattva may appear in a particular mudra as the psychophysical expression of, say, compassion, love, teaching, bestowing blessing, fierce clarity, fierce compassion that cuts off ignorance, groundedness, and so on, and so on. And a practitioner can take the physical, psychological, and energetic form of a Bodhisattva in order to approach and unify with that perfection.</p>
<p>It can be said that everything we do is mudra.</p>
<p>When you reach across to a suffering friend and touch their shoulder, that is mudra. It is not merely physical; there is an energy or intention behind it. Everyone understands this mudra. You and your friend become one through this mudra. You extend and offer yourself through it. Your mind and heart become wider and warmer through it.</p>
<p>When you are tormented by a migraine headache or by some horrible experience in life, you may hold your head in your hands. This is a mudra of torment. The physical shape and the internal experience go together. Everyone understands this mudra.</p>
<p>In the so-called Cosmic Mudra, the person sits cross-legged (iconically in lotus position) and the fingers and thumbs of the hands form a circle in the lap. The second knuckles of one hand rest over the second knuckles of the other, and the thumbs touch. Buddhas tend to be shown with the right hand over the left, signifying that they are actively expressing their Buddha-nature (as the right side is active and the left side is passive). In many but not all traditions, meditators are instructed to sit with their left hands over their right hands, signifying the pacification of their as yet impure mind. When the mind finally becomes pure, the hands and the intent can be switched, with active right hand over passive left.</p>
<p>The circle of the hands frames the lower belly, the grounded seat of energy in the body. Someone who is beset by thinking is said to be 'up in their head' too much. Someone whose emotions are out of control is living too much in their heart. Groundedness tends to be associated with living from the belly. This is also reflected in where tension tends to appear in one's body: when those knots and habitually held tensions disappear from the face, neck, shoulders, arms, back, chest, and belly, the center of balance sinks downward around the body's center of gravity in the lower belly. It is significant that the cosmic mudra frames this area.</p>
<p>When the thinking and feeling similarly settles down completely — when one is no longer attached to a false world of separate objects maintained by thinking-feeling attachment — then one's <em>true</em> body appears: the whole universe. This reality is upheld by science, and it can also be experienced directly when one lets go of thought during meditation.</p>
<p>So the correct Cosmic Mudra is not merely the body position. The <em>mind</em> must take that mudra as well. The mind must become cosmic. From our everyday (false) view, this may seem like overblown mumbo-jumbo; but it is actually the more accurate view. We habitually see ourselves as separate entities that 'have' a mind, living within a cosmos. But when false thoughts are released the actual experience (if voiced imperfectly with language) is that the cosmos and self are all within mind — or rather, that the cosmos and self are all <em>made of</em> mind.</p>
<p>People have difficulty giving up their false, limited view simply because they have practiced it all their lives (and, if you accept the Buddhist teaching, for countless lives before that); and it is supported and encouraged by everything we build around us. Our buildings and streets, our ways of communicating, our entertainment and advertising — it all comes from the ignorant mind, so it all takes the form of ignorance and supports the ignorant view. Our activities, our cities, and our man-made world are mudras of ignorance.</p>
<p>So concerted, consistent effort is necessary in order to break through that ignorant view. The willingness to be open-minded has to be applied time and again. This is the humility that is all-important in true spiritual practice. Without humility, the teaching and view cannot enter you. The Buddha himself could be standing in front of you bestowing the entire teaching, but if you don't have the humility to open to it, you can't receive it.</p>
<p>So the Cosmic Mudra is open. The hands both rest openly as well as creating a perfect circle. This has a deep psychological meaning. One is open to truth, but one's essential nature is already perfect truth. The whole circle of completion, the whole universe, is no other than you. We <em>start</em> with that faith in our own completion. If we started as an impoverished, flawed being trying to access something great, we would be living a lie. Although in some sense that is what we are doing, the <em>more real</em> sense is that we are already complete, already free, already perfect. So we practice to embody what we already are. This is another meaning of the Cosmic Mudra.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the Cosmic Mudra provides a very good biofeedback for the meditator: when the thumbs press in tightly and turn white, you can know that you are applying too much effort, too much tension; and when the thumbs slump and the circle of the hands collapses, you can know that your sitting is becoming dull. The physical posture reflects the mind and energy; the mind and energy create the physical posture. So when your meditation is bright and clear and non-grasping, holding the perfect physical mudra is easy, effortless. It seems to happen by itself.</p>
<p>The mudra can also be conceived as a series of concentric circles: there is the circle of the hands, the circle of the arms, and the circle of the cosmos. None of these should be missing from the mudra. So again, we are reminded that we do not sit as a flawed, separate being trying to make something happen; instead, we sit as the universe. This is the proper way of thinking of practice. We sit as the universe expressing itself.</p>
