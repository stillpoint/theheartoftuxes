  <h1>meditating on extreme sadness - a bad idea?</h1>

<p>What does that mean, "meditating on sadness"? What do you do with your mind and body?</p>
<p>If it means going into sadness and trying to feel it more deeply, that has some value as an exercise in owning one's emotions, but is a more specialized psychological practice and not really a meditation. Meditation doesn't force the mind to go to some particular state, much less a negative one.</p>
<p>Practicing with sadness is sometimes part of a therapeutic path, and sometimes part of a shamanic or  ecstatic path where one brings oneself to a crisis point in order to prompt a release. The <em>extremely</em> important prerequisite for these practices is the <strong>establishment of a proper container</strong> for the practice and the <strong>ability to return</strong> from it.</p>
<p>So two conditions have to be met in order to undertake this practice in a healthy way: the correct container for the practice, and the ability to return from the dark place.</p>
<p><strong><em>Container</em></strong> means that the environment, method, time and setting, attitude, and intent all have to be correct and in alignment — and not in a haphazard way, but very meticulously correct on every point. This usually entails the presence of a guide — a teacher or experienced mentor who is able to not only oversee the process, but who can respond from beyond ego and know how and when and why to spur you on or pull you out. It also very often means learning a specific ritual, with objects and actions that serve as grounding touchstones. These kinds of practices can be like Pandora's box: they can unleash parts of the mind that are bigger than your ability to control. A proper container helps support you in the practice and keep you from getting swallowed up by the experience. That is why all parts of the container have to be taken care of meticulously — so there will be no place for leakage, no place where the darkness can find a foothold to possess you.</p>
<p>The second essential prerequisite is the <strong>ability to find your way back</strong>. This means that you have previously established your ability to ground yourself not only in common everyday events, but in tumultuous emotional or mental upheavals. This is by definition an uncommon level of ability. Do you have a long-standing, consistent meditation and mindfulness practice? Can you reliably return to groundedness, letting go of trains of thought and relating to simple reality (the feel of the floor, the sight of what is in front of your eyes, the actual sounds around you)? Can you "take it or leave it", in equanimity as opposed to grasping a certain result?</p>
<p>Consistent practice with ritual and discipline, under the guidance of a teacher, is the healthy requirement for this kind of emotion practice. If you still feel particularly drawn to practice with sadness and other emotions, I may be able to offer some suggestions for study with a teacher.</p>
<p>Many people who dabble with shamanic practices or try to invent their own meditations go out of whack. They have good intent going in to the darkness, but can't find their way out. This is also a very common problem among artists. So many artists have the courage or heart to delve into issues and experiences that as humans we all share but that we may resist. The trouble is that most artists have not established the two essential conditions: the container and the ability to return; so we see many brilliant and talented people swallowed up by the things they opened up in their creative process. From dysfunctional relationships to personal torment to self-harm and suicide, we all have heard of shamans — painters, writers, rock stars, healers — who have gone into the darkness and have not come out with their best balance and integrity.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that seeking big emotions or other big experiences is an imbalance of character. It is the ego seeking its own establishment. The ego doesn't like to be openhanded; it likes to create its own drama so that there's always something definite to feel and do. But meditation goes in the other direction. In meditation, one opens one hands and allows things to move where they will. Sadness, joy, anger, love, thoughts, sensations, energetic experiences, or anything that arises is allowed to arise and move as it will. One maintains one's stable center within it all. This is the healthy relationship with the mind. If you think you know best where to steer your mind, that is an ignorant and dangerous attitude. Only the most accomplished masters can claim to know, but their knowing has been gained by long and devoted practice in letting-be.</p>
<p>So consider that the motive <em>behind</em> going into sadness — the excitement or interest you feel — may <em>not</em> be an intent to be clear. That may be what you <em>think</em> about it, but the actual motive behind it may be tied to a deeper psychological pattern driving you toward big emotion, or negativity, or some other unconscious agenda established long ago.</p>
<p>I've said before that questions are statements. It's often the case that people who post questions here already know or sense the answer, they're just hoping to be convinced out of it. It seems that, as much as you would like a practice, you already have an inkling that this one may not be healthy.</p>
