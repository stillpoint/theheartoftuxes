  <h1>Any tips for someone trying to stop constant rumination and racing thoughts?</h1>

<p>I know you're just trying to understand, so don't worry. I don't think you're splitting hairs or being argumentative.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>If you consider returning to the object of your meditation equivalent to stopping thoughts, they you're still attached to your thoughts, you're still paying attention to the thoughts and checking them, seeing how they're going and whether they're staying or going. So your attention is in the wrong place: attached to external objects, which include the thinking objects.</p>
<p>You should not try to stop or steer. But how to you stay there, in the not-stopping-or-steering place? How do you maintain your correct, open-handed relationship to your mind and experience? Unless you are already there and can maintain it, you need a way to return. You need something that will help you find your way back to not-stopping-or-steering. One way is to use one object of focus to help you let go of all others.</p>
<p>The important thing is to be present. That is what all true meditations teach. Whatever other aims or effects they may have, all meditation methods have this in common: be present. If you are checking your situation to see how it is, to judge it, and to label it good or bad, sufficient or insufficient, then at that time you are not present; you have stepped outside of your true experience and have engaged with objects. Along with not trying to stop or steer the thoughts you must also not try to check or judge them. Just let them be. Certain thoughts may still arise, continue for a short or long time, and pass. Sometimes more thoughts, sometimes fewer thoughts. None of that has to do with your ability to be present, to maintain openhanded awareness.</p>
<p>So for example, your basic mind is like a mirror. It only reflects what appears. It's reflecting capacity is absolutely perfect; there is no delay, no mistake. When something appears, your mirror-mind reflects it; that is, it appears in your awareness. When nothing appears, the reflecting capacity doesn't suddenly go away; it is still there, there is just no object to be reflected. So this is like complete silence in meditation, where no object appears but the awareness is still very bright and vivid and alive. If at that moment you check to see how it's going, you <em>create</em> a "you" object and a "how it's going" object, and you lose your awareness as you look around for something to check and judge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a lot of objects appear, the mirror reflects them perfectly and without effort. The mirror has no more effort in reflecting many objects than it does reflecting just one or none. Its essential nature remains the same. Likewise, when thoughts or other objects appear during meditation, it's no problem. Only be the mirror. Only be the witness, the awareness.</p>
<p>Another example: When you are sitting on the beach watching the whole scene, anything can appear and it's just part of the scene. The ocean and sky can be perfectly clear and calm, or the ocean can be windy and wavy and full of jumping fish, and the sky can be churning full of clouds and birds. Either way is fine; the witness stays constant, just watching. If you, as the witness, go to sleep you miss the scene, whether it is calm or active. If you, as the witness, get fascinated or concerned or otherwise caught up with one object, hoping to grasp it or wishing it would go away, then likewise you are not aware and miss the whole scene. So your job is to be the constant witness, not to try to make the scene one way or another. Sometimes the scene will be busy, sometimes calm. Either way, no problem.</p>
<p>Some people are able to return to openhanded presence easily. Some people never leave openhanded presence, even in their sleep; and these people we call <em>masters</em>. But many have difficulty. They are so attached to the <em>objects</em> that appear in their awareness (in the mirror, or in the scene), and so attached to the drama that they make about those objects, that awareness seems like a distant and impossible concept. For these people, some method of repeatedly returning is helpful. That is why an object of focus is often used, at least until one is familiar enough with awareness to continue on one's own.</p>
<p>If the chosen object is counting the breath, the meditator returns to the number in the count: "one....", "twoooo....", "threee....", and so on. Each count is a chance to let go of all other concerns, all other objects. Never mind whatever else is going on in the mind's mirror or scene, only pay attention to the one object of meditation. When you get hooked by thinking or other things you consider distractions, just return to the count as soon as you realize it.</p>
<p>Through consistent practice, your ability to return will develop. That is the thing you strengthen. It has nothing to do with whether the mind-mirror or scene is calm or busy. Something nice takes you away: return. Something unpleasant takes you away: return.</p>
<p>Because in your entire life (and previous lives) you have almost exclusively attached to the objects in the mirror and tried to manipulate them you have developed a very strong grasping and manipulating habit. That habit currently controls the way you relate with life. So when you meditate, your mind will automatically follow your habit, checking how you're doing, following thoughts you think of as important or images or sounds you find pleasant, trying to avoid unpleasant sensations, making ideas and stories and dramas about how everything is playing out. This is all distraction. The cure is to return to the object of meditation, very simply, very quickly, without making any more thought-objects and dramas. Every time, just return to "one..." in the count. (If you are working with some other meditation object like mantra or sensation of breath, etc., you return to <em>that</em>. Very simple.)</p>
<p>Then the power of returning becomes stronger, you start to understand the awareness that is always there behind it all, and in time you can begin to work with awareness directly without using an object to help you get back there.</p>
