  <h1>I still see no "buy-in" to Meditation.</h1>

<p>There is no need to struggle for or against trying to improve yourself or your situation. As your awareness grows you will gradually see where your thinking goes wrong, and you will naturally let go of attachments that now vex you.</p>
<p>The problem that all us meditators share is that we check our minds â€” we step outside our ourselves and try to see whether we're doing well or poorly, and compare and judge ourselves according to what we've learned or what we've seen in others. Trying to see and trying to control means we don't trust ourselves. So our trusting has to become stronger. We need to let go of checking and just take care of the center. That means: moment to moment, just be sincere. You are originally already sincere. If you don't add other thinking, holding, and making to it, there's no need to check "am I being sincere?" Only be sincere.</p>
<p>If at some point you find that you've been deluding yourself or that selfishness has entered the picture, then at that moment drop it and return to your correct center. This has an open-handed quality, something like letting go of the steering wheel after you've finished a turn, to let the car find its own straight line again. It's like starting fresh, from zero. No need to make sincerity arise or dismiss an imagined ego, only drop it all in a moment.</p>
<p>This should come as a great relief! The mental gymnastics are not required! Only drop it all.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...is the goal not to destroy that feeling but reduce it's power over your behaviour?</em></p>
<p>Yes, this is right. Your thinking and your feeling is really none of your business. If you try to manipulate your mind, then you become a fascist dictator, and this begins to extend to the people in your life and to the whole world. People who very strongly try to manipulate their mind become actual terrorists, whether in personal relationships or in global politics.</p>
<p>Healing compassion is open-handed. The dropping, the letting-go, is your great power. This power can be developed. You can become better at it, you can make it more immediate, and you can digest bigger and bigger experiences with it. Eventually, you can be open-handed with every part of yourself and your world. A person like this is identified as a saint or sage.</p>
<p>This is one reason why one sits still in meditation. It is both a symbol and an embodiment of the immovable mind, the mind that nothing can bother. A stitch in the side? Sit still. An itch on your neck? Sit still. Agitated thoughts? Sit still. Little by little, you acknowledge and exercise your original being, that doesn't depend on anything. Any kind of thinking or feeling can appear, and it's okay; because that thought or feeling is <em>not you, not yours</em>. It is just a phenomenon, like changing weather. Sometimes sun, sometimes rain, sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes something in between. Everything, no problem.</p>
<p>When you have a clear meditation method, then you have a clear chance to drop it all in a moment. If counting breaths is your method, for instance, then you drop everything else and return to the appropriate number in the count. Distraction will occur; that's no problem. When you realize you've wandered, drop the wandering and return to the count.</p>
<p>In this way, you can instantly and immediately wield your great power of dropping. This can be used with anxiety as well. Let it go (let it be), and return to counting.</p>
<p>Beginning meditators get confused about letting go; they think letting go means that the thing they let go of must disappear. That's not the case. Don't check or judge your situation: "Has the thing disappeared? Oh, it's still here; that means I've failed. I'm not a good meditator; I have no power." This is wrong. Your only job is to let go and return to the method. Whatever happens with your mind or feeling is none of your business. This is how you strengthen your power, how you develop your immovable center and express it in your life.</p>
<p>If you persevere in this manner, your thoughts and feelings will self-regulate. It is not that you drive them away or control them, but you see through them as you might see through a magician's illusion. "Oh, that's not mine. I don't need to be concerned about it."</p>
<p>If anxiety is so strong that you can't even engage in meditation, then you can do physical practices that help calm the mind. Running, swimming, free dancing, and especially bowing practice are very good for helping the mind settle. If even this doesn't help, then you may need to look at the roots of your anxiety with a good helper like a psychotherapist or counsellor. Once you understand the origin of the anxiety, the effect is the same: you see through it like seeing through an illusion that no longer has a hold on you.</p>
