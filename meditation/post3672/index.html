  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>LOL!</p>
<p>What is repeating and growing in your unconscious these days? If you are like most others, it's already very creepy.</p>
<p>Some practices are indeed like self-hypnosis. I also don't like them; but they have their correct purpose, and they help some people. But mantra is not self-hypnosis if it helps you wake up. The proper use is to be clear and present, not to lull yourself into a dull rhythm.</p>
<p>There are many ways of working with mantra. Some ways use trance to bring a person into contact with their basic nature â€” the still mind behind all mental movement. Some ways use trance for shamanic purposes, for personal or communal healing. Many ways don't use trance at all. (And Easwaran has his own particular style, which may tend to lean toward Hindu teachings, and so he shouldn't be thought of as speaking for all Buddhism.)</p>
<p>So some mantra methods are indeed contrived and intrusive. This is true of many spiritual/energetic practices: an unnatural, contrived (but ultimately beneficial) process is adopted in order to overthrow the common mind, which is equally unnatural and contrived. Your usual mind is very creepy; but it is <em>usual</em>, it is your everyday experience, so you think of it as normal. It is not normal; it is just common.</p>
<p>So sometimes techniques are used to clear the way or bring in a different structure. If that is the case, one had better be sure that the new structure is in fact beneficial. This requires quite a bit more research into the matter than you have done. You've been triggered by a few phrases without seeing the scientific, cause-and-effect aim of the practice, and you've labeled and written off the method as 'creepy'.</p>
<p>More research and conceptual understanding are necessary.</p>
<p>But anyway, you don't have to do that style of mantra practice. I also don't like that style. It is a unification/concentration style, so it's a bit unnatural. The aim is to remove all contrivances, all false concepts with a single object (in this case mantra), at which time you can let go of or merge with the object and experience your true boundless nature. It has an extra step to it, a held object.</p>
<p>There are other ways of using mantra that employ open presence, and others that use self-inquiry, and yet more ways that are used together with visualization to call forth divine energies. The selection is very broad. In some methods, for example, mantra is used as a framework to help you stay openly present. It is then just an anchor, nothing more: if you lose the mantra you know that you've lost your just-now mind, so then you can easily return; but you don't hold the mantra to the exclusion of everything else. So there are different ways of keeping your mind when using mantra.</p>
<p>Mistrust and trepidation often arise in relation to meditation practices. They seem 'of a different world'. They are new, unusual. They work at levels we're not used to working at. It's <em>good</em> that they do! If they didn't, the meditation would not be effective, and the result would not be complete and transformative.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of doubt here, and it's important to be aware of which one is operating. There is investigative doubt, which is interested to learn how things operate; and there is ungrounded doubt, which hinders progress. The first kind of doubt has an engaged, open, questioning attitude. It leaves the issue open, so you can find out through research and experience what is really the case: what is the teacher really on about, what is really the aim of the practice, how does it work, and is it right for you?</p>
<p>The second kind of doubt comes from the ego's desperate need to maintain control at all costs. The ego wants things to stay the same; it wants to steer your life. Anything that threatens its dominance is mistrusted. Anything that is ungraspable, unknown, changeable, or bigger than thought is seen as the ultimate threat. So reality and the meditative practices that lead to reality are big, big threats to the ego! Therefore it brings up emotional reactions and speculative doubts and churning thoughts to block the process of surrender.</p>
<p>For instance, many new meditators experience coming to the edge of surrender and then feeling fear or doubt. It can be emotional dread, it can be eruption of doubtful thoughts (that may seem like very reasonable arguments and suspicions), and it can be a physical nausea or sense of falling or other danger. This often happens when one is on the verge of letting go, but has not yet done so. It is the ego's fear of dying. <em>You</em> and your mind don't die in meditation, but what you are attached to dies. Falsehood dies. So the more attached you are to ego and its false structures, the more fear will manifest in meditation practice.</p>
<p>The important cures are (A) to receive good teaching from a good teacher, so you understand very well the intent and the cause-and-effect process of the practice; and (B) to settle in openhanded simplicity. You don't have to control the moment; the moment is already okay. If you don't add or subtract anything, there is nothing to fear about the real moment. It is just plain. It's when you add speculation and fantasy, or subtract your engagement, that unreality gains a foothold and starts to control your mind.</p>
<p>You don't have to do mantra if you are afraid of it. Correct mantra practice has helped many billions of people, and has been the method by which a good number have gained enlightenment. So if you don't yet understand it, it is not appropriate to denounce it. It is not appropriate to bring up ego-based doubt in others, preventing them from adopting a method that otherwise could not only help them but could completely liberate them from suffering. If you yourself don't overcome this second kind of doubt, this ego reaction, you will never, ever progress in meditation and you will never, ever move beyond your own habitual, limited thoughts.</p>
