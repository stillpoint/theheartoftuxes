  <h1>rather then quitting is this a better way to go or will my brain chemistry still be messed up?</h1>

<p>My life is not your life; my situation is not your situation. It doesn't matter what I do. You should respond to <em>your</em> situation: your responsibilities, character, strengths and weaknesses, the needs of those around you, etc.</p>
<p>I can speak in terms of generalities regarding healthy, balanced changes.</p>
<p>Basic needs of the body have to be addressed. If the body is sick or out of balance, it is more difficult to balance the mind. Mind also affects body; but in general more sophisticated things wont' work if the basics are not in place. Build a structure level by level upon a stable base.</p>
<p>Eating and sleeping are the most basic needs, where you can help or hinder yourself tremendously. The first need is simply regularity. Getting enough sleep regularly is important, and having a fairly stable sleep schedule is important.</p>
<p>Next, we can talk about timing. In the Yellow Emperor's treatise on health, an ancient Chinese document that offers insight into the rhythms of life and how to relate to them, it is said that it is healthiest to wake up before the sun rises. If that is possible for you, that's great. Like I said, the first thing is regularity, even if you don't wake up before sunrise; but if you can, it will help your inner rhythms have more order, and will reconnect you with the Nature that nourishes and teaches you every moment of every day.</p>
<p>Lingering in bed is not good. It impairs both the physical and the mental flow.</p>
<p>As much as possible, avoid sleeping either too little or too much. 7 to 9 hours tends to be ideal, but it varies from person to person. In the Yellow Emperor's treatise it is said that sleeping too much is worse than sleeping too little, because sleeping too little can harm the body but sleeping too much can harm the spirit. So it is very helpful to have a very clear daily intention and very clear morning routine, so you don't have to argue with yourself about whether to get up and what to do; you only do it. That is a very helpful practice. Only do it.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a morning routine I recommend:</strong> The moment you start to become conscious in the morning, whether you have opened your eyes or not, <strong>piece together the body in your awareness</strong>. You can start with the hands, just feeling them, just listening to what they are, what's happening with them in the moment. Then you can add your feet, so you try to keep hands and feet in your awareness. Then gradually let the awareness seep inward, including more of the limbs, the head, and soon the whole body. Listen as well as you can to the body as a whole. There is no expectation that you will feel something in particular. There is no expectation that you will not feel something in particular. You may notice things you never noticed before; you may realize that a bodypart or the whole body is really nothing like what you thought it was. Likely you will not be able to feel the whole body at the same time, either because the awareness is not stable enough or because bodyparts fade in and out of sensation. You may for example feel a bubbling or buzzing feeling in the arms, and feel nothing at all in the belly; you may feel vast areas of space moving about; and this may change unpredictably. All of this is no problem; the main thing is that you use your intention and attention to come into your own body, to inhabit it consciously, and to be as unified as you can in a relaxed way.</p>
<p>If you don't hold unnecessary expectations, this is a very easy morning practice. It is a very, very wonderful way to start the day, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You simply have something clear to do with your mind, so negative trains of thought have less hold on you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You make your first act a conscious one. The day tends to go the way you wake up, so if you wake up with consciousness the day tends to have that theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inhabiting the body is a very healthy practice, and is a helpful skill for overcoming addiction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Unifying</em> the body engenders peace — your mind and spirit have a place where they can settle. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being open and non-judgmental about the sensations that come and go heals the emotions and builds poise and proper relationship with yourself. Rather than being controlled by feelings and trains of thought, you learn to let them be; therefore you can be free, you can make your own clear choices. And you can discover that self-acceptance can be an easy, relaxed experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without even doing anything special you may get some insight into your true nature. The realization may arise "I am not this body". Much freedom and contentment can follow from this realization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are lying in bed, having pieced together the body, you can <strong>make an intention or prayer</strong>: "This body is always changing. One day it will go away. May I live a useful day today; may I act with compassion toward myself and others." This is not something to judge yourself about, but a good wish with good feeling behind it. Of course, you should make the intention that is close to your heart, the one that is sincere for you. Just try to include others in it; don't be stingy and try to get everything just for yourself. A stingy mind is not contented.</p>
<p>These two practices can take less than a minute or can take several minutes. Whatever is comfortable for you. Once they are complete, <strong>get out of bed quickly and with a sense of purpose</strong>. Let your first movements of the day be decisive and confident, or at least clear, instead of resistant and mushy. Go straight to the washroom sink and <strong>splash cold water on your face</strong>. This is another connection with the body, helping the mind and spirit that have been wandering in dreams through the night come home clearly. It is also refreshing, and reminds you that your original mind is already clean and fresh. <strong>No matter what happens in life, you have a mind that is already clean and fresh. Reconnect with it at every opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>Your next morning activity can be <strong>whatever beneficial activity you want to try</strong>. Something where you express or exert yourself is beneficial (as opposed to starting the day with greedy consuming attitude). Going for a walk around the block is wonderful. You might choose to go for a longer bike ride or run. You might want to do a few minutes of meditation, or breathing, or yoga. A few minutes of free-form stretching and movement works for some people, while others do well with something very structured like the sun salutation series of yoga postures, or prostration practice. Chanting is possible. Mantra, out loud or silently is possible. If you have an image of Buddha or some other image of peace and nobility, you can spend a couple of minutes every morning just gazing at the image and taking in its good qualities, making them your own.</p>
<p>There are many possible beneficial practices. It's not necessary to make it difficult, nor make it a big heavy operation. Just <strong>something of benefit that you can count on every morning</strong>. Knowing ahead of time what you'll be doing can sidestep <em>so many</em> obstacles that otherwise can appear in the half-conscious state — when the mind is not yet clear but you are awake enough to carry out its unclear agenda. I think you can see the benefit of not starting your day with negative habits, yes?</p>
<p>The shadow times between waking and sleeping are vulnerable. If you are tired during the day or stay up late at night, these vulnerable shadow times become longer. You are half-awake and your wandering, dreaming, habitual mind tends to be in control. Lying down with eyes closed, for example, is a terrible position for making clear decisions about your life; you've probably experienced how the mind can run off in crazy tangents, and take you with it.</p>
<p>So besides having a clear morning routine, it's very helpful to have a <strong>clear evening routine</strong>. In some respects this is more difficult to achieve, because thinking and doing have been riled up through the day, and tend to have their own momentum which can sometimes be difficult to calm. You may want to <strong>set an evening alarm</strong> to help you remember your intention to be clear and to help yourself be healthy and whole. When the evening bell rings, you can <strong>recite or read a card with a short vow or inspirational phrase</strong>; or you can otherwise drop what else you're doing and start to prepare for sleep.</p>
<p><strong>30 seconds of doing nothing</strong> can be a very good option at the evening bell. Starting to clean up, turning the lights down lower, and turning down or off any TV, computer, radio or other distractions helps bring forth that general sense of slowing and calming and preparing to relax into sleep. It should at best happen in tune with the cycle of the day, so as the sky starts to dim outside your light and activity should start to dim inside your living space.</p>
<p>If the mind is racing, at least let it race toward beneficial things rather than addictions and negative thoughts and emotions. You may want to have some books of Dharma around to read, not only to occupy the mind but to let clear, healthy patterns of thought start to sink in and become your own. Recorded chanting or other sacred sounds can also be a help. Some people use headphones with drones, binaural beats, or nature sounds to help them stay with positive patterns as they enter the shadow time. There are also desktop computer and smartphone apps that provide natural sounds or chanting.</p>
<p>Between morning and night, having good <strong>work</strong> is a vital support, whether employment or helping a neighbor.</p>
<p>When you get anxiety, put yourself in a strong position. The moment you become aware that anxiety threatens to control your action, settle into an upright, noble, relaxed posture; and take some smooth, easy, empowering breaths. Slouching or lying down make you more vulnerable to being controlled by anxiety. Being around negative images or clutter also makes you more vulnerable. But sitting or standing like Mount Fuji — grounded, calm, noble — can help you stay in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
