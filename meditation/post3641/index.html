  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Any new form will present difficulty simply because it's new to you. Add to that the prejudices, habits, obstacles, and other tendencies you bring into the encounter. And top it off with incomplete, impure, unclear, misguided, opinionated, or conflicting teaching. This is how 'distraction' and discontent arise.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/316tbg/my_favorite_mantra/cpz8lwr">One of my previous posts</a> on mantras (in its entirety):</p>
<p>&gt; There are many different ways of working with mantras. Some methods can be easily performed with just the most basic instruction, while some require transmission from a master, empowerment ceremonies, and detailed procedures.
&gt; 
&gt; In its most basic forms mantra practice involves a series of syllables to which one returns, abandoning distraction and returning to presence. The mantra becomes one way (among many) of returning to the present moment.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not necessarily important to have a meaning in mind while doing mantra. The phrases that OP shares are a non-traditional way. The traditional method doesn't engage the thinking as much. In most cases it doesn't matter what syllables you work with so long as you practice confidently and sincerely. (One master joked that you could use "Coca Cola, Coca Cola..." so long as you proceeded faithfully.) Some more complex methods require you to understand and evoke the archetypal meanings of the syllables, which are expressions of primal universal energies; but in the methods that can be performed simply it is not at all necessary to think about meaning. You just repeat the mantra aloud or internally, and keep returning to it whenever the mind wanders.
&gt; 
&gt; In practice, you might start performing the mantra aloud with the voice to help connect with it, and then taper off and do most of the practice internally. If the mind is particularly agitated or dull the voice can be used to help you be present and stay with the mantra. Mantra practice that is intentionally done aloud is called <em>japa</em>. Long mantras (<em>dharanis</em>) or sutras sung aloud are usually referred to as 'chanting practice'.
&gt; 
&gt; The simple practice has two basic styles, concentration style and mindfulness style.
&gt; 
&gt; Concentration style means you stay with the mantra and relinquish other actions and experiences. You let go of everything else (you don't try to push it away or make it disappear). This brings the mind to a one-pointed state, in which the mantra becomes clear — very vivid and very persistent; you perceive it clearly, and there is not much interruption to that perception. Soon the illusion of subject and object dissolves: there is no longer a sense that "<em>I'm</em> doing mantra", but only the momentary fact of the mantra continuing. On the heels of that, even that perception may fade, and complete emptiness may emerge. Coming out of or going into the non-dual state, you may experience insight into your true nature, and if the mind is ripe you may even have an awakening experience. The order of how experiences arise is not important, and really is none of your concern. You just stay fully with the method of repeating the mantra and letting go of other things.
&gt; 
&gt; Mindfulness style means the mantra is repeated continuously while you go about your daily activities. The stream of syllables is kept in a more gentle, background way, and the awareness remains open to other things that are going on, both internally and externally. 'Awareness remaining open' doesn't mean you need to do anything special. It is just regular everyday mind; you don't push in any particular direction, and you don't try to retreat from any experience that arises. In this practice the mantra serves as a sort of anchor to keep you present even while you are engaged with all kinds of different thoughts and activities. Over time this practice purifies your relationship with your activity and with life, and makes you solidly rooted in the real moment.
&gt; 
&gt; At first you may need to harness your mental resources to stay with the mantra. Later, as the recitation becomes automatic, a different issue usually arises: it becomes so easy to do the mantra that you start doing it in an unconscious way, no longer staying present and aware. At each phase you will learn what is required by continuing to return to simple presence.
&gt; 
&gt; You can do either style at any time. Mantra practice can be short or long. Cause and effect are clear: you will get results according to your effort and your correct application of the method. If you do concentration style, you should do it in a controlled environment where you won't endanger yourself or others since your attention will withdraw to a single object. So don't do that style while walking or driving in the city, for example. Mindfulness style can and should be performed anywhere, so long as you can function well while doing it (you might have to be careful at first, as some people — either by nature or by desire — drop into a very focused concentration style practice in which their awareness of other things diminishes).
&gt; 
&gt; Some practitioners do mantra practice in conjunction with a <em>mala</em>, a string of meditation beads. If they have made a vow to perform a certain number of repetitions they may use the <em>mala</em> as a counter. Others use the <em>mala</em> as a support in returning to physical grounding and the present moment: each bead can represent a complete re-set, one mantra repetition and one bead experienced wholeheartedly. You can try using a <em>mala</em> to see if you like the tactile support and sense of rhythm it provides, or you can do mantra practice without a mala. Either way is no problem, either way is nothing special.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to study the energetic, symbolic, or secret meanings of mantras you should find a master to teach you. In this field, many practices are forbidden unless the proper teaching and empowerment can be given. Otherwise, you won't need much more instruction on mantra than I've provided above. The only thing remaining is to choose from some of the most famous mantras available. If you are seeking a very specific effect, like to change a particular kind of mind sickness, a special mantra can be prescribed; but in general any traditional mantra will do.
&gt; 
&gt; * Maybe the most famous mantra is <em>Om Mani Padme Hum</em> (most commonly performed in the Tibetan pronunciation <em>Om Mani Pedmay Hung</em>.
&gt; 
&gt; * Names of Bodhisattvas are also used as mantras by many millions of people. The most common may be the name of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, <em>Kwanseum Bosal</em> in Korean or <em>Kannon</em> in Japanese. Many Chinese and other East Asian practitioners repeat the name of the Buddha of Infinite Light, Amitabha. In Korean the recitation is <em>Amita-bul</em> or <em>Namu Amita-bul</em> ("Honor to Amitabha"). In Chinese the recitation is <em>Amito-fo</em> or <em>Namo Amito-fo</em>.
&gt; 
&gt; * In Hindu practice, the mantra <em>Om Nama Shivaya</em> is very popular. Sometimes just <em>Om</em> is used, especially when chanting slowly aloud. The phrase <em>So Ham</em> ("I am" or "I am that I am") is often used in conjunction with breathing practice: <em>So</em> on the inhalation, and <em>Ham</em> on the exhalation.
&gt; 
&gt; * In Christian practice, variations of the phrase <em>Jesus, save me, a sinner</em> are used, including <em>Jesus save me</em> or simply <em>Jesus</em>. These phrases may generate accompanying thoughts and feelings, for better or worse. An alternative is the mantra <em>Maranatha</em> ("Come, Lord").
&gt; 
&gt; * The ancient Hawaiian mantra <em>Ho-oponopono</em> is also very famous. It is practiced with an accompanying intent or attitude of warm-heartedness and humility. This attitude is said to have four aspects when spoken of in the English language: "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you."
&gt; 
&gt; Any of these mantras will produce results according to your effort and the form of your practice.</p>
