  <h1>This is not the dharma</h1>

<p>Please understand that I am writing the following with care and understanding for you, as I and many others have gone through what I believe you're going through. If you disagree, no problem; you can disregard what I have to say:</p>
<p>I suppose if you are more advanced than these masters, with clearer view and more complete knowledge, you could just snort and dismiss them. But that is not the case, so please don't be arrogant! Put down your sense of entitlement, by which you believe that you deserve to understand everything as soon as you hear it.</p>
<p>When the target has been missed, the immature archer blames the arrow, the mature archer blames his shooting.</p>
<p>If you try to pluck knowledge from diverse sources, don't blame the sources if <em>you</em> get confused. If you access talks given to particular students in particular situations, don't blame the teacher if <em>you</em> can't make the connection. If you expect a particular kind of answer, don't blame the teaching for not meeting <em>your</em> expectations.</p>
<p>You are bothered, frustrated. Will you begrudge others the teachings offered to them?</p>
<p>If you want correct guidance you have to submit to a verified teacher, put down your opinions, and do your practice.</p>
<p>It's a very common pattern that people who have done one or two retreats and have started to get a little smidgen of Dharma energy lose the humility of the beginner and start to strut and gripe and throw their weight around. On one hand this shows the positive emergence of independence, but it's a bit like the emerging independence of five-year-olds who pout and say "no!" to everything: they are testing their new-found power. On the other hand, it exhibits the re-emergence of the ego that wasn't happy taking the back seat during training.</p>
<p>For the student it feels like righteousness and scrupulousness — it feels like they are calling for high standards — but in reality it is the ego learning to surreptitiously take control of the spiritual process. For a while during the nascent training, sincerity and humility overshadowed ego. But practice is still immature; ego has not been brought to light and purified, it has just been driven underground for a while. So it comes back with a game plan for putting its "I, my, me" agenda back on top. It does this with critical, judgmental thoughts. You want to think of yourself as spiritual and sincere and exacting, so your thoughts justify the view of yourself as more spiritual and sincere and exacting than even some of the greatest teachers we know! Alarm bells should be going off.</p>
<p>The will to justice or 'rightness' has a close enemy, which is indignation. A positive quality becomes tainted with negativity when self-cherishing is involved. Notice the emotional tone of your experience. It is not steeped in equanimity... even-mindedness... open-handedness, but rather has an angry feel. That scorn, resentment, and indignation show you that self-centeredness has once again climbed in behind the driver's wheel. It is no longer about Dharma, but about you getting what you want.</p>
<p>I say all of this not in judgment, but to guide you through the territory. You are here because you have progressed this far. Now it's time to become aware of this new dynamic and start again from a place of humility.</p>
<p>The issue of the human shadow and its influence on our views and relationships in spiritual practice is not well understood by many practitioners; but understanding it would prevent or at least reduce so many painful mistakes in practice.</p>
<p>Very basically, <strong>we experience as external the material we deny in ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, we don't want to see and feel our own uncertainty, so we try to disown it. The uncertainty that is actually ours becomes "everyone else's". Suddenly, we are surrounded by idiots. But this is the projection of our own shadow. It is called 'shadow' because it is the mind material that we push out of the light of awareness, the thoughts and feelings we try not to see.</p>
<p>But when it is pushed into shadow, it controls us unconsciously. What we deny about ourselves doesn't just disappear. It continues to function; but it functions without us knowing that it is functioning and without knowing that it is coming from <em>us</em>. So our world gets colored by the things we don't own, and we keep encountering the same problems again and again because our own shadow is always forming our experience.</p>
<p>The way to resolve these seemingly external frustrations doesn't lie out there in the world. It's not that you have to get everyone to agree and follow your agenda. Rather, the way to resolve the frustrations is to see and admit to every last bit of those frustrating dynamics as belonging to you, coming from you. "<em>I</em> am unclear. <em>I</em> am shallow. <em>I</em> have lots of baggage and superfluous thinking. <em>I</em> have difficulty responding appropriately." These and more have to be owned and digested. Then everything is in the light, everything is just truth. Very mature, very human.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dark-Side-Light-Chasers-ebook/dp/B004BDP05C"><em>The Dark Side Of The Light Chasers</em></a>, by Debbie Ford, for anyone 'chasing the light', starting out on a spiritual path. And maybe even more so for those further down the path, who may think of themselves as more advanced and expert. The huge shadow that develops by hiding human weaknesses has often appeared disastrously, in scandal and harm to the community.</p>
<p>As to the place of reading: most of us do too much, and in an ungrounded way. Words and concepts should be taken in small bites, chewed well, and digested properly through practice. Over-ingesting concepts leads to indigestion for the mind and unbalancing effect on the being.</p>
<p>If you have learned a practice method well, you shouldn't be turning to books for your inspiration; you should be turning to your practice for inspiration. This is true for most of us. We give lip service to going for refuge, but we don't as a practice entrust ourselves to the Tathagata, to Unknowing; we instead tend to entrust ourselves to our thinking, figuring, and manipulating.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to hear the basic teachings many times, maybe many thousands of times, for it to sink in deeply to the inner layers of our being, below the churning thoughts and automatic patterns. That is why it is very wonderful that great teachers have the patience and clarity to repeat the most simple and central teachings over and over and over again. If we are not rejoicing over and over and over again upon hearing the teachings, something's wrong.</p>
<p>So we need to keep hearing the Dharma. But by the same token, we shouldn't think that we can cherry-pick our own enlightenment or fashion our own course of training. That is also still an immature pursuit. The mature student is mature enough to know he can't do it alone, and thus submits to a guide who can hold the great view, beyond ego, beyond shadow.</p>
<p>Best of luck in your study, practice, and life.</p>
