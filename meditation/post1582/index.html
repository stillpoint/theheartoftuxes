  <h1>I prefer to meditate with my eyes open. When I meditate, my eyes start to drift one way and my vision gets blurry and darker unless I blink. Why is that?</h1>

<p>Thank you; that's all important information.</p>
<p>There is unclarity about the method, and that allows for not only distraction and misinterpretation of experiences, but also for <em>thinking about</em> the distractions and other experiences. Because you are not sure what you should be doing with your mind, you open the door to speculation and doubt. "Is this a good thing, or a bad thing?" "Should I try to change this, or not?" "What does this mean? Is it significant? Is it normal?" All of these kinds of thoughts may come up, sometimes very subtly and almost unnoticeably.</p>
<p>So you need to be very clear about the method, and the method should suit your situation and purpose.</p>
<p>Because you have been diagnosed with an eye problem, you shouldn't do any practice that puts strain on the eyes or brings excess energy to the visual process. So unless closely guided by a very capable teacher you may want to steer away from meditations that focus on visual objects and also away from visualization. That makes sense, right?, in that even visualizing something with your imagination can over-involve your visual capacity.</p>
<p>I hear that you are looking for something to help you be calmer and more focused, in part so that you can be more productive. Some of the meditations that address these aims will actually also be very good in terms of helping your energy settle so that it doesn't amass up in the head and create heat and tension there. In any process you undertake, you should make a point of consciously relaxing and releasing your weight downward through your physical structure and into the mat or chair you're sitting on. The feeling of sunken weight will help the energy come down and flow in a more healthy way.</p>
<p>There are many types of meditation, but meditation that works with awareness of the breath is beneficial and fruitful at all levels from beginner to most advanced. Deep breath both calms and nourishes the body. If you apply your attention to the breath without forcing it, it can provide an anchor for your sitting meditation — something you can return to when distractions take you away.</p>
<p>The anchor becomes stronger with practice, and can be taken into daily life as an anchor for mindful activity throughout the day. That means you will have a better center of balance; when you get thrown off or distracted, you will be able to return to your correct balance sooner.</p>
<p>Awareness of breath also has the benefit of connecting you with your body. The body is a very important part of your quest for calmness, clarity, and functionality. If you doubt this, just consider how much less control you have over your mind when you are asleep and dreaming. In your dreams, you are largely disembodied, so your thoughts and images fly around without you being able to influence them very much. When you wake up and feel your body, suddenly you can know where you are, and you can take action to help yourself.</p>
<p>So letting the energy and awareness settle into the body is very helpful.</p>
<p>I would take caution with instructions to "clear your mind". This does not lead to freedom, and it is one of the biggest misconceptions people have about meditation. Meditation is not brainwashing; it is not about becoming a blank, thoughtless lump. Although there may be times when you experience a complete cessation of inner dialog (which is a wonderful and significant event), that is not the <em>aim</em> of meditation. In meditation, you don't try to make your mind into anything in particular; rather you sit with complete faith in yourself, maintaining your center whether there is thinking or not. The mind is free to do what it does; you just don't attach to that. You follow the method. The method trains you in being free of the coming and going of the mind.</p>
<p>Is that clear? If you try to push away thinking, you will create pressure in your mind, a fight between you and yourself. But if you keep returning to the method, then your mind will naturally settle by itself. Your aim is to keep <em>moment mind</em>.</p>
<p>If you want my recommendation, I would say that following the breath as it shows up in your lower belly would be a good practice for you. This brings attention down into the body, encourages settling, promotes healthy breathing, and provides an anchor that you can return to repeatedly. The caution with this meditation is that it is easy to fall into trying to control your situation through your breathing. Since you want to promote calmness, a little bit of lengthening of the breath is okay; but you should know when you're putting too much tension into the practice.</p>
<p>The method:
Sit comfortably upright on a firm mat or folded blanket, or on a firm chair. If on a mat, the knees should rest firmly on the mat (use whatever firm, non-bouncy cushion you need to raise the hips and allow the knees to touch the mat). If sitting in a chair, the feet should be planted firmly on the floor. Your body structure should keep you upright without a backrest. This develops self-reliance and vigilance.</p>
<p>The belly should be relaxed. Let the sit-bones of the hips be vertical, so that the belly can hang softly in front. The lower back shouldn't collapse inward or outward.</p>
<p>You can simply rest one hand on the other; or form a circular meditation posture with the second knuckles of one hand over the second knuckles of the other, and thumbs touching; or you can rest your hands palm down on your knees.</p>
<p>The head should float lightly atop the spine. The face should face forward, and the neck shouldn't jut out in front or be pulled in tightly backwards. Some people imagine a string gently lifting the body from the top of the skull. If you take a very full breath while relaxed, filling the chest, the body should shape itself well; and then you can release the breath and settle your weight downward, but without collapsing your skeleton. This is a noble, awake posture. It is also very stable and resilient, helping you to find your noble, awake, centered, resilient mind.</p>
<p>The jaw should be relaxed, and the tip of the tongue should rest just touching the hard palate behind the upper teeth. This is a natural position for most people.</p>
<p>Eyes remain gently open, either gazing at an angle down to the floor or a little bit up in front of you. It would be helpful not to have bright, contrasty patterns or distracting objects in front of you. The eyes don't need to focus on anything; you'll be focusing on your breathing. The eyes can pretty much be forgotten as long as they are relaxed. This quality of seeing also reflects the mind you're seeking: gentle, aware, accepting. It is very different from the common way of using vision, where energy goes out through the eyes and the vision tries to grab objects.</p>
<p>So even with the posture, you are helping yourself to be calm and focused. In fact, the calm, focused mind and the calm, focused body are not two different things.</p>
<p>When you start your meditation, rock forward and back, and side to side, finding your center of balance. Then rest, feeling the weight sink into the mat or chair. The more you relax, the more you can have a sense of sinking or releasing downward.</p>
<p>Feel the belly extending and withdrawing with the breath. If this is not obvious to you, you may need to encourage the breath to enter more deeply. You can put your hand on your lower belly and try to push it out (forward) when you inhale, and let it return inward when you exhale. With practice, this can become a very comfortable, soothing experience. (It is the way babies breathe, but has been trained out of many of us by the stresses of modern life.) The out-breath, in particular, can be felt with a sense of letting go and relief, like a very pleasant sigh.</p>
<p>For the first 10 or 20 breaths, let the breath be a bit deeper than may be usual. The out-breath can be roughly twice as long as the in-breath. So if you breathe in for three long counts, then breathe out for around six long counts. This will give you something a bit more to focus on at the beginning, to encourage calmness, connect you to the breathing body, and 'remind' the breath of its full natural range.</p>
<p>After the first couple of minutes, though, you should let go of doing anything in particular with the breath, and just observe its movements in the belly. Feel the lower belly move, and just follow that movement as if you're sensing a balloon being inflated and deflated.</p>
<p>When thinking takes you away, once you notice gently return to the method; gently return to feeling the belly move with the breath. It doesn't matter how fast or how deep the breath goes; it will likely change from time to time, and from sitting to sitting. It doesn't matter what happens in the thinking or how often it takes you away; only gently and immediately return once you notice. This means that you refuse to become disturbed by anything the thinking does. That is called "concentration", and it is this power of calm focus that you are looking for.</p>
<p>If you want to take the practice into daily life, focus on letting the weight settle downward, releasing tension down into the earth, and feel your breath in the belly as you go about your activities.</p>
<p>If the mind wanders excessively, there are additions to the method that can help — mantra or counting, for example — but if you can persevere with this method it should help you succeed in your stated goals.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
