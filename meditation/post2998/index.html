  <h1>Modifying Mindfulness in Plain English?</h1>

<p>Each method has the tradition from which it arose, and which informs it. Each method has a context of training in a certain form of lifestyle, a certain worldview, and the insight and bent of nature of the teacher. If you take one thing from one method and another thing from another method, it's possible that you lose or defy the context.</p>
<p>To put it another way, there are often very good reasons for instructions to be a certain way, and for them to be presented in a certain order. These reasons may not occur to inexperienced meditators; and more subtle points of teaching may not occur even to experienced meditators.</p>
<p>So it's best to check with the teacher of your particular chosen tradition whether a change is appropriate, and under what conditions it may be adopted.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for sensing the breath at the nostrils is that it is possible to perceive exceedingly fine sensation there, much more so than perceiving the rising and falling of the belly. This is of benefit in certain styles of vipassana, as one moves attention to ever more subtle phenomena, and then perhaps to the attentive faculty itself.</p>
<p>There are different styles of so-called vipassana practice, and some of the meditations taught under the umbrella of 'vipassana' are not actually vipassana/insight meditations, but rather companion practices that are more aimed at training concentration. The various methods are not necessarily interchangeable; and some vipassana teachers would absolutely refuse changes like you propose. You could swiftly be kicked out of the program! This is not simple hard-headedness; it is for your benefit, so that the practice can be conducted precisely, properly, and without doubt; and so that ultimately it can lead to its hard-won result of awakening and liberation.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for focusing on breath at the lower belly is that energy can sometimes build up in the head, bringing anxiety and instability; and focusing at the belly can help it settle. If there are physiological difficulties associated with breathing through the nose, this may also be an option in certain styles.</p>
<p>But you say '<em>hara</em>', which brings in a whole bunch of other possible issues. Will you be focusing on a general area, on a specific area, on sensation, on movement, on energy...? These are all different possibilities associated with different styles and different intended effects. Is this an energy meditation or an insight meditation? What is the object; and why is it chosen as the object? If you say the object is breath, does that mean air, or energy, or the movements of breathing, or the sensations that happen with the passage of breath, or a visualization or guiding of the movement of energy...? These points belong to various methods for various reasons.</p>
<p>Without a teacher's guidance, again you are put in the situation of depending on your preference and limited view, rather than the wisdom inherent within the traditional form or the wisdom provided by a living guide. It is a situation very open to egoic manipulation. If you start to cater to your preference, your guessing, and your urge to tinker, these forces will only grow more dominant in your practice.</p>
<p>I suggest that if you really want to practice with your attention in your lower belly, you find a method that is taught that way. Or contact the author or a qualified person who teaches the style you're asking about, and follow their guidance.</p>
<p>Standing is a valid form, and one of the traditional postures for meditation. Really, the traditional postures — sitting, standing, lying down, and walking — mean all postures and all of life. Practice can eventually be done at all times and in all postures and situations.</p>
<p>But many billions of people have practiced sitting meditation, including many, many people who have done numerous long sitting retreats. How much are you going to meditate, that sitting should become a problem? Several hours a day? I'm not sure that even that would be unhealthy; but if it were, I'm pretty sure that standing for that length of time would be very uncomfortable, if not injurious.</p>
<p>As an example of the complete nature of traditional teaching, your concern is addressed in most traditions. Theravada (including vipassana) practice tends to intersperse sitting and walking meditations, both to give the body relief and to address both depth of practice (through sitting) and its application in mindful daily life interactions (through walking). Mahayana practice tends to include walking, working, and prostration meditations, some of which can be very vigorous indeed! Physical balance, mental balance, and lifestyle training are all included in the training. Although to the uninformed person the changes in practice could seem quite arbitrary, there are very good reasons for them to be presented as they are.</p>
<p>Again, I recommend consulting with a teacher in the chosen tradition to learn about the possibilities.</p>
<p>Sedentary life can be unhealthy. Sitting in poor posture or with blocked circulation can be unhealthy. Many very healthy people, however, sit in meditation for long periods. Consider for instance the vibrant Indian yogis, full of life energy. Traditional sitting postures are meant to encourage stability, healthy alignment, and circulation of blood, breath, and energy. If there is a specific problem taking these postures, that's another issue that is best addressed with a live teacher over the course of gradual training. You can get better at it; and you can get support for it.</p>
<p>At a basic level, if you are just practicing presence, focusing on the lower belly is okay, focusing on movements of breathing is okay, focusing on sensation is okay, sitting is okay, standing is okay. If you know what method you are using and why, it is all okay. No problem.</p>
<p>Once a practitioner has digested the teaching and integrated it into his/her life, and once they have become very stable in correct motivation and consistent practice, often they may adapt the practice to match their personal nature and situation. Within some traditions this is possible, and expected; within other traditions it is discouraged. This difference also has a reason behind it, as the thrust of some traditions is very broad and not so dependent on form, while the thrust of other traditions is quite specific and formal. In the former cases, the student is expected to depend more on her/his own inner resources; in the latter cases, the student is expected to always maintain specific rules of discipline. Both ways are valid, for different reasons.</p>
<p>If you want to eventually advance to more transformative practice and higher, less common attainments, learning and practicing a proven traditional method is important.</p>
<p>I guess the question is what you want from practice, and if you are willing to let your motivation be advanced by teaching (or if you are satisfied to keep it at its current level).</p>
