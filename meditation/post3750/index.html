  <h1>Awareness of Thoughts without them disappearing? Right type of meditation?</h1>

<p>Since you tell me your living situation and isolation from teachers I understand now why you would want to reach out to practitioners through the internet. Also, you say that your practice is consistent and that you don't feel you are cherrypicking parts of answers. That is good, and I believe what you say.</p>
<p>You ask about seeing thoughts while they're happening. What would be the point? There may be various purposes, but I wonder what you consider the purpose.</p>
<p>Actually, you are right that when you look at it directly, the thought stops. Then you have the state of no-thought, which is a bright, open awareness. Although it may seem like nothing significant because it has no form to speak of, nothing to identify or make into something, it is actually extremely significant. This flavorless state is a taste of your true nature.</p>
<p>It would be much more valuable to rest in that plain open awareness than to seek out some kind of form to cling to. The only benefit that might eventually come of chasing thoughts would be (if you are fortunate) returning to the before-thinking awareness.</p>
<p>If you see a drama unfold in a mirror you may easily think the mirror contains the drama. But when there is a pause, a moment of nothing being reflected in the mirror, you may realize that the reflective nature of the mirror is the basis of everything happening there. It would be the first time that the essential nature of the mirror is perceived, the nature as something not dependent on the things reflected in it.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you have a moment of non-thought, you have a chance to experience the true reflective nature of your mind. Don't <em>try</em> to see it as 'something'; don't look for a state or feeling or insight; because that would again be looking for form â€” for a <em>thing</em> reflected in the mind rather than mind itself. But if you rest very easily in that clear moment you will be expressing your true nature. Repeating that experience time and again will bring your true nature forth, and it may eventually hit you what the upshot of it all amounts to.</p>
<p>When you get a glimpse of the true nature of your mind, you don't need the clear spaces any more. Yes, the practice is to rest there; but you can continue high-class practice without requiring the empty space. That is because you will understand that everything in life is equal: it is all stuff reflected in the mirror of mind. It has the same mind substance, the same original purity. So living with purity of mind ultimately doesn't depend on any experience.</p>
<p>But for your purpose, which is to find solace and relief from GAD, a realization experience is not necessary. Just resting in your own true nature is clear, peaceful, stable, confident, integral, and easy. And it is also <em>nothing special</em>. There is no content in the mirror, no drama, so there is nothing to make a big deal of.</p>
<p>The more you rest in your true before-thinking nature, the less you identify with the drama in the mirror of your mind. You disengage from the illusion that appears, and you become more grounded in the essential reality behind it all. That is the greatest healing. Psychological tools can certainly help us, but for the most part they deal with the content, the drama in the mirror; they act on how we assume our life as beings. Practice can reach deeper, to the mirror itself, the basis of being.</p>
<p>What you describe in looking for thought, not being able to find it, and reaching a 'stopped' place is a variation of self-inquiry, which is a famous form of meditation. If you are very motivated, you could continue this practice and rest in the space reached. It's not necessary to make a big crusade of reaching the stopped point. If you do choose to proceed, you should do it in a consistent, methodical way, but with plainness and relaxation. Just follow the method, and if you happen to come across a before-thinking moment, rest there without the need to do anything. When that goes away and thought arises again, return to the method of seeking thought. That is one option for you. But if you choose that method you should stick to it, without trying to mix methods and paths.</p>
<p>Sticking to shamatha practice is also a very good option. For you, one very good benefit is that you have already researched it and you have already been practicing it consistently. So might as well keep swinging your axe at that tree.</p>
<p>Shamatha is, literally, 'calming' meditation. You focus on one object as you relinquish all others. That means that you intentionally and repeatedly relinquish objects that generate anxiety for you; you let go of the thoughts and other stimuli that are agitating, and keep returning to the one object of meditation. That one object should be a traditionally recommended object so you can be sure that it will be available for your practice and that it will have a beneficial effect on your mind. Some objects, for example, could be easy to keep in mind, but might promote attachment. Traditional objects are chosen because they are effective in meditation and don't promote attachment or aversion or other negative reactions.</p>
<p>Metta, or good-will, meditation also includes shamatha and its calming effect on the mind, but also engages the kind and broad heart. This is indeed a very good recommendation.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of shamatha meditation is that it is exclusive; it focuses on one object and excludes others. So it is not open to the movement of situations and therefore doesn't promote awakening to movement. Essential aspects of reality, like impermanence and interpenetration, are usually not realized through shamatha. That is why it is either traditionally combined with vipassana practice, or included in a broader context of training.</p>
