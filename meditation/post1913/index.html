  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>In your previous state you weren't trying to get to a previous state; so already you are doing something different with your mind, making something of it. This is how feedback begins between new experiences and the stories we make about them, until the experiences are built into something with a life off their own, through the strength of our imagination.</p>
<p>Many, many new experiences will come with meditation. You will perceive new territories of the mind. Energies that had been blocked or suppressed will release. Subconscious material -- dream material -- will bubble up. Movements and sensations that went unnoticed will come into focus.</p>
<p>The best course of action is to <em>let it be</em>. Don't make a big deal of it. In fact, don't make <em>anything</em> of it with your thinking, speculating, story-making, comparing, worrying, pride, etc. Don't touch!</p>
<p>Lightning finds its course of least resistance until it reaches ground. Water flows free until it reaches the ocean. Let these things be what they are and let them move as they move. If it's not painful or seriously disturbing, just return to your meditation. (Traditional paths have remedies for serious disturbances.)</p>
<p>We hold many stuck patterns within us. The most fundamental of these is the profound attachment to self-image; and upon this are layered many emotional wounds, habits downloaded from parents, peers, and culture, patterns of avoidance or indulgence, physical blocks from injury or bad posture or chronic misuse, energetic blocks like layers of an onion.... Meditation (proper meditation, anyway) gradually unclenches us. We apply ungrasping, unknowing, and undoing to our present-moment situation. Therefore over time these stuck patterns tend to soften and release.</p>
<p>Just as energy gets shifted when matter changes state, so too do we experience upthrusts and outpourings when our physical, mental, or emotional blockages soften. We change from frozen to fluid, and energy gets released. And sometimes the false distinction between physical, mental, and emotional will itself dissolve. And sometimes the false block between inner and outer worlds will dissolve. It is all perfectly natural. It is just <em>uncommon</em>. So get used to the uncommon, and don't add more dramatic material with your thinking. Just return to correct meditation.</p>
<p>Some meditators will experience uprising of energy as these blockages release. In a proper traditional course of training this is accounted for, and actually powers the meditator's transformation. Various systems describe it differently; but in general it can be referred to as spiritual energy. Of course, the ego wants to think of itself as special, so everyone tends to jump to the conclusion that they're having a big spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>When a football player scores a touchdown for the first time, it seems like the greatest event in the history of the universe. But after they've scored a hundred touchdowns, it's seen as a nice thing but not that ground-shaking. Likewise, when you encounter new experiences in meditation, at first the ego will go gaga about them, making them into either big threats or big crowning glories.</p>
<p>It's all the ego's shtick, the illusory drama of the illusory self-image. And very often, just when the you are about to let go and dissolve into freedom, the ego will bring you these thoughts or even generate questionable sensations or visions, <em>just to keep you involved with it</em> -- just to keep you thinking and doing rather than softening.</p>
<p>Some spiritual practices work by pushing strongly. Energy is generated and then forced through blockages, to quickly prompt a special experience. The problem is that those following this approach tend to lack the foundation or container for that experience when it comes; they only know forcing, they don't know letting-be. This is a low-class approach, but it works for some people. This way especially requires very close guidance, and high level of trust in the guide.</p>
<p>Other practices are more focused on letting-be. It doesn't mean there isn't a great deal of effort involved; but the kind of effort is different. This path is based on awareness of our original completion -- from the beginningless beginning, we are already complete, we are already okay; there is nothing outside of us that will make us more complete.</p>
<p>In both paths, unusual experience will occur. Many of the energetic manifestations that arise are not in fact the dawning of spiritual energy, but are 'qi effects'. Qi (or <em>chi</em>) effects happen with blockage. When energy piles up at a blockage, it can be experienced as soreness, throbbing, vibrating, or feeling of fullness, among other manifestations. True spiritual energy is free-flowing, cool, and somewhat empty, so it doesn't tend to present in the same way.</p>
<p>So most of what meditators experience as energetic sensations are the result of local blockage. But if it has already been there, why is the feeling new and strange? Either one is just beginning to notice it because other distractions are beginning to calm down, or one is actually bringing energy there with one's attention (hence the more you fixate on it the bigger it gets), or some energy is being built or released elsewhere through the meditative process and then coming upon this local traffic jam.</p>
<p>If you do your meditation without a grasping mindset, these things will resolve themselves like water finding its way to the ocean. If you fixate, you create an altogether new issue with your fixation.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of traditional training is that it is wholistic. It's not just stuck on the mat and up in the head. In this day and age, we have so much energy stuck in our heads! <em>And then we go about trying to resolve it through thinking!</em> It's the insanity of our era.</p>
<p>The physical side of complete training is very important and helpful. Techniques for dissipating built-up energy, especially built up in the head, are useful. Vigorous physical practice at other times in the day or immediately before sitting is exceptionally good at bringing energy down out of the head and promoting over flow. It is healthy, it is comfortable, and it improves your sittings.</p>
<p>Check out protestations or other physical practices. You can check my posting history for recommendations.</p>
<p>If you eventually do have an event of flourishing spiritual energy, it will be very good at that time to have the knowledge and training to meet it wisely, and the ability to return to <em>ground</em> developed through proper meditation day by day, moment by moment. Therefore seek out an authorized teacher of a complete traditional path sooner rather than later.</p>
