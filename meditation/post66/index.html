  <h1>Moving Meditation?</h1>

<p>I've either dabbled in or practiced full-on various Hindu Yogas, Taoist Yoga, Tibetan Yoga, Qigong, Baguazhang, Shintaido, Various Wushu/Kung Fu, Taiji, Free Dance, 5Rhythms, Authentic Movement, Contact Improvisation, Sun Mu Do, many kinds of walking meditation. Of course, with a meditative attitude pretty much anything, any kind of activity, can become a moving meditation.</p>
<p>Movement is an extremely influential and essential facet of spiritual practice. It goes beyond simply "bringing the meditation into everyday life", which in itself is very important. Movement is the nature of the manifest world. Everything moves, and there is no thing that is not movement. The aspects of reality known as <em>anatta</em> (no fixed self), <em>asvabhava</em> (no own-being), and <em>anicca</em> (impermanence) in Buddhism are all none other than the truth of movement.</p>
<p>Everything moves, and there is no 'object' doing the moving. So to move, as in a moving meditation practice, is to become intimate with reality. It is one way of embodying truth.</p>
<p>If you look closely you will find that the ancient masters were all masters of movement. They didn't necessarily all practice some formal movement training (although some did), but their enlightenment was a rich, inclusive, flowing enlightenment. True enlightenment is vibrant, not static. Look, and you'll find Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu, Heraclitus, Patanjali, Gautama Buddha, and many great Zen masters all talking about change, transformation, interpenetration.</p>
<p>Insight, conceptual understanding, and embodiment all support each other. They are different aspects of one practice, one enlightenment. Putting conceptual knowledge into the body grounds it â€” makes it real and personal and deeply experienced. There is no substitute. Without embodiment, even true conception lacks roots. But when someone deeply embodied walks in the room, you know it; there is no doubt about her or his presence.</p>
<p>Carl Jung affirmed the mind-body connection. He wrote that lessons become lasting wisdom when they are experienced through the body. That is one reason why I think the combination of still (sitting/standing/lying) meditation and movement practices is a potent one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the benefit of a good flow of energy in spiritual practice is hard to overestimate. Beyond the intermediate levels, when the basics of practice have been internalized, flow becomes a telling issue. One can see the difference between practitioners who are still <em>trying</em> to make it happen, still going by external standards and supports, and practitioners who seem to have a fountain of energy, and who are never stopped by difficulty. Even within a single sitting, the difference between stagnation and flow is very significant in its effect on both comfort and insight.</p>
<p>In energetic terms, flow and insight are also two aspects of the same thing; and some courses of training may work primarily with energy, to help it flow in the faith that insight will follow. On more mundane, day-to-day terms, "the body likes to be taken for a walk". It is productive of health and joyfulness to stay in motion.</p>
<p>Finding movement practice was one of the best things to ever happen to my spiritual practice. It brought me down to earth and more into my humanity, helped me to relate better to my own emotions (both positive and negative) and to other people. It gave me countless new vocabularies and tools to deal with the ups and downs of life. And it breathed new life and fun into practices and studies that threatened to become too dour and stale.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's nothing like still sitting meditation for accessing depth. I have yet to meet a solely movement-oriented practitioner, for instance, who could rival some of the great Zen masters in terms of attainment. But the combination of the two approaches is very powerful, and all of the great meditative traditions include both stillness and movement (whether through work, or walking practice, or out-and-out movement methods).</p>
<hr />
<p>I often recommend movement practices in these forums.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1xa8d9/5_rhythms_anyone/cf9oneg">Here is my comment in response to a post on 5Rhythms movement/dance practice.
</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/21a83i/trying_to_start_meditation_but_i_quickly_become/cgb5jml">Here I mention movement practices in relation to healing emotional wounds.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;<em>Movement meditations can engage the body to help ground you. People's energy and perspective is usually based in one of three centers: when it's up in the head, there is a lot of thinking and imagining; when it's in the heart, there is a lot of feeling and surging; and when it's in the belly, there is more calm and balance. Movement meditation can help the energy come down from your heart where it is overactive and into the center of the body, where it has more rootedness. Walking meditation, Taiji, and prostrations could all work well for you. I usually recommend free danceâ€¦</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/29tvrv/how_to_cry_or_laugh_instantly/ciokphk">Here's another post on overcoming emotional obstacles in practice, with my recommendation of movement training.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;<em>A practice that includes almost all of these factors (awareness, open-handedness, self-trust, expression, sensitivity, body, and breath) is free dance, also known recently as conscious dance. The term refers to such modalities as</em> <strong>Authentic Movement</strong>, <strong>5Rhythms</strong>, <strong>Soul Motion</strong>, <em>and</em> <strong>Movement Medicine</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> to the above modalities you might add Biodanza, Continuum, Open Floor, Trance Dancing, Tamalpa Life Process, and other less well-known or more health/entertainment-oriented practices.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Forgot to mention prostration practice (bowing), which is an incredibly effective method for settling the mind, grounding, and harnessing personal power. Prostration practice can be done very simply, or as part of a devotional practice, or in combination with mantras or visualizations. It is also an excellent full-body and aerobic exercise with many health benefits.</p>
