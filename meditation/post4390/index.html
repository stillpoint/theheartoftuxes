  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; I think I will pick up a breath-based method, something simpler than breath counting as I do not have access to mala.</p>
<p>Breath counting is very simple! Sometimes having that extra structure of the numbers makes it more obvious what you're supposed to be doing, whereas there might otherwise be a tendency to waver or think about how you could do it differently, or better, or (as you note) start controlling the breath. Some people find that having the (counting) number to focus on helps them harness the attention and lead it away from those kinds of diversions.</p>
<p>That's not to say that counting breaths is the only way or the best way; but it's <em>one</em> common traditional way, especially for developing concentration.</p>
<p>Also, sorry if I wasn't clear about using a mala. You don't need to use a mala at all, with either breathing practice or mantra. And also, you could use a mala without doing either of those. There are many options; it's important just to choose one and do it.</p>
<p>I just like a mala because if its tactile feedback. Even if my mind is going around and around, I can feel one bead just now and let my life be that simple for a moment: just this one sensation at my fingers, just now.</p>
<p>But you can use feet-on-the-floor for tactile feedback; or you can use awareness (not necessarily control, but awareness) of body posture. One Zen Master uses the place where his thumbs touch the steering wheel as a touchstone when he's driving. You might actually use a literal touchstone, touching a pebble in your pocket or feeling the weight of a larger stone in your hands from time to time.</p>
<p>These are all 'skillful means'. There are thousands of helpful little techniques; but the main thing is letting go of distraction and returning to simple mind. That's what they all have in common.</p>
<p>You mention that you stop breathing when you drift off. If we were working more closely, I might encourage you to look into the kind of drifting. There are a few different ways breathing tends to stop. In some cases, tension and the controlling habit make the breathing tighter. It's because one wants something to hold onto as one approaches the big melting-merging of concentration. One doesn't understand that the melting-merging is actually one's true self, not the one struggling for control.</p>
<p>Another way it may arise is through dullness. Some people are constitutionally slow, sluggish, low-energy. While the opposite constitutional type may deal with uncertainty by pumping up and getting anxious, this type often habitually sinks into a kind of dreamy dullness. The breath may become slow and dull as well.</p>
<p>But there's also the still breath that's indicative of deeper concentration. In some phases or levels of concentration, the breath may become very fine and subtle. The gross connection with the body is no longer predominant; the clarity of mind comes to the forefront; so the breath shifts from a gross body-feeding process to a very fine and clear, almost still movement, like the very gentle and clearly reflective swells of ocean on a very calm day. When concentration is very deep, the breath can even stop, without harming the organism. The difference here is that the stopping has a very bright, clear, open quality rather than something either dull or forced.</p>
<p>You ask if controlling is okay. Well, that's a whole bag of worms.</p>
<p>Yes, controlling is okayyyy.... but who or what is behind the control? Is it wisdom? Will it always be wisdom? Or will unconscious psychological agendas take over; and how will you know if they do?</p>
<p>The <em>modus operandi</em> of the 'ego' (the self-illusion) is control. Ego wants to control everything. That is what it does so well, and why it's a good thing to have around. But if that is what is <em>leading</em> the process, it's not a good thing; it's not healthy, and it doesn't contribute to a happy, integrated being.</p>
<p>I mean, you can probably sense for yourself what many of the issues are. For instance, if you stand next to a stranger who is forcefully controlling his or her breath, what do you feel? <em>How</em> do you feel standing next to them, compared to standing next to someone breathing freely, comfortably, naturally? Isn't there some kind of pent-up, almost sinister feeling? There is a lively natural feeling to someone who breathes freely. It is as if you can trust them.</p>
<p>There are some (actually, many) practices that do use controlled breath; but the direction of these is narrow and precise. They are part of an overall system, and they are appropriately taught and overseen by an expert. That means that someone whose ego doesn't get in the way can lead to to a safe and happy way to use controlled breath, rather than having the process taken over by your unconscious grasping, controlling habit-mind.</p>
<p>For instance, if you control the breath without knowing how to also let go of it, then you could easily build up feelings of tension (and eventually physical effects like high blood pressure, headaches, etc.). The constant feeling of tension could coat your whole waking experience with a sense of fear or mistrust. Because you are struggling for control, you create a life in which you think you <em>need</em> to struggle for control.</p>
<p>So it's not that there's something <em>wrong</em> with control, but that it should be led by the right leader. The charioteer should be steering, not the horse. Also, if you're going that way, you should learn the possible effects of control, and know how to identify them and what to do with them. This is all taught in traditional courses — for instance, in pranayama study as part of traditional Yoga training, or in breath practices of Taoist internal arts.</p>
<p>But in plain, simple concentration training, I would encourage you to first learn how to let the breath <em>be</em>. How to let it go, how to let it be natural and do whatever it wants to do. If you ungrasp your body and mind, everything will find its own appropriate place and relationship. It is like lightning finding its path through the atmosphere, or water finding its path down the mountain, or trees following the movement of the wind. If you completely let go, your breath and mind and energy will all find their appropriate relationship. No controlling necessary. But some <em>trust</em> necessary.</p>
<p>Once you know what it means to breathe naturally, and once you can reliably let that happen, then you can start to look into control by letting the out-breath be longer than the in-breath. Exhalation has a settling quality, as you let go of what you've been holding. At the end of exhalation, there's a fleeting still place that you can look into and enjoy. No need to grasp at it, but once you experience that stillness and spaciousness you don't have to turn away from it. Then soon it grows into blissful silence. Very enjoyable. This is possible if you already know how to let go. But if you haven't already practiced letting go, and if you don't already know the value, the importance of openhandeness, then all these nice things can become attachments and obstacles.</p>
<p>This is the way I see it, and the way my teachers have passed on, and the way I encourage. Others may recommend another way.</p>
<p>So bottom line: What I recommend is that you find a good method and follow it meticulously. While practicing concentration, let the breath be natural. But <em>as a partner practice</em> you can maybe do some controlled breathing exercises that you learn from Taiji or Yoga or Zen or some other reputable source. On the one hand, you will practice correct letting go in your concentration practice; and on the other hand, you will learn how to breathe fully and you will become familiar with the effects of breath in a separate, dedicated breathing practice.</p>
<p>Neither one has to be a big deal. No need for fancy, unless you like fancy. Simple mind is most important.</p>
<p>If you happen to find a good teacher, then follow her or his advice, and never mind what I've written here. A living teacher is very precious.</p>
<p>Best wishes along the way!</p>
