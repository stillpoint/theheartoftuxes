  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Yeah forget about the Prajna thing, I was mistaken, and as you pointed out it isn't really related directly. Also my previous comments were kind of lazy, this one's a bit better.</em></p>
<p>Prajna is in fact the crux of the issue. But apprehending it is no small feat. It's not a matter of argument, but of attainment.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>As far as I can see your main point in your first post is that through meditation one can get to a point of fully attaining truth. That is a belief, not a fact. Even those who have "attained truth" could be mistaken in thinking they have attained truth.</em></p>
<p><em>Your</em> thought that it is only a belief is only a belief. Someone who has direct experience will know differently.</p>
<p>Your mistake is in assuming that there is a 'someone' who knows or doesn't know, and a 'something' to be known or not known. If you attach to words and thoughts as if they really exist, this is indeed your only recourse. From that consciousness, you can't imagine that attainment is possible. And because you can't imagine it, you assume it must not be so.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I think the crux of the thing is the broad range of possible definitions for "truth".</em></p>
<p>I wouldn't disagree. If you're thinking, you're already off the mark.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I would say that you definition of truth is rooted in Buddhist thinking, and as you stated Marcus Aurelius probably had no mediation experience, and certainly had no Buddhist experience, and so it is likely that the definition of truth that he was implying in his statement here is different to the definition you are applying to it.</em></p>
<p>What I'm saying is not from Buddhism. It can't be. If it's from an 'ism', that's not it. It has to be from <em>Prajna</em> itself, from the central reality, <em>before</em> views and perspectives arise.</p>
<p>I agree that Marcus Aurelius, or whoever made that statement, may be dealing with a different concept of truth, a more conventional, relative (political?) one. That's why I made the original reply, to point out the deficiency in the statement.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>...although we cannot have perfect knowledge of existence</em></p>
<p>You must own this as merely your belief. If you're going to have philosophical integrity here, you have to admit that you actually don't know.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...we can get some small relative knowledge of existence, like a perspective on the truth.</em></p>
<p>Yes, we can definitely get this too.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So in your last example I could say "I know the water is wet", and my statement would be true. But that is a relative truth, or perspective, and not an absolute truth.</em></p>
<p>So you don't know water is wet, or do you? Which is it?</p>
<p>If you say that you know, <em>you</em> are displaying the hubris here.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry that you're clinging to your opinion here in particular, because this is the point where you could be set free. There is a very clear response to the question, which doesn't fall into the hubris of "I know" and doesn't fall into the ignorance of "I don't know".</p>
<p>As it stands, if you don't answer clearly you have both hubris <em>and</em> ignorance.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So it still fits with Marcus Aurelius' statement.</em></p>
<p>Yes, sadly.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>But probably my interpretation was influenced by my own thinking and my own time and so different to what the original statement made.</em></p>
<p>Yes, that too.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I stand by my assertion that you are suffering form hubris because you have made several comments that demonstrate that you believe that Buddhist thinking is the only way to find truth.</em></p>
<p>No, you're completely mistaken there, because Buddhist thinking can't touch truth. Neither can Marcus Aurelius' thinking, your thinking, my thinking, Christian thinking, Pagan thinking, agnostic thinking. I would never say that Buddhist thinking is the way to truth, much less the <em>only</em> way.</p>
<p>Wetness is not Buddhist. <em>Do you see the crane in the pine tree?!!</em> Do you <em>know</em> that water is wet?</p>
<p><em>Thinking</em> can't apprehend truth. This is where you align with what I'm saying, whether you recognize it or not.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>This is what I think led you to misinterpret the quote by applying your own definitions to the words. You are so caught up in your own perspective that you cannot see beyond it, and disregard other perspectives.</em></p>
<p>As above, my perspective is not Buddhist. So this part about Buddhist style thinking is your assumption, your projection. Please own that, as you've been willing to do with some of your other mistakes.</p>
<p>If you don't yet understand freedom from perspective or don't believe it's possible, then just say it that way. No need to project your view -- the only view you can conceive at the moment -- onto someone else.</p>
<p>You assume that I don't take other perspectives into account. You don't consider that I do take other perspectives into account, and that yet a possibility exists not depending on perspective.</p>
<p>So you need to solve the 'do you know water is wet' question. We've established that you can't say you know, because that's hubris, and merely relative. You can't say that you don't know, because that's insincere and ignorant. What can you do? There's a clear response that attains truth.</p>
<p>If you say you know, it must be <em>actual</em> knowing, not theory, not speculation, not logic, not argument, not belief, but actual truth.</p>
<p>If you say you don't know, you must be like a senseless ghost, unable to be in the world.</p>
<p>One answer cuts through these two polarities. But it can't come from thinking. Thinking is what makes those apparent polarities. The answer comes from before thinking, from direct attainment of truth.</p>
<p>If you answer the question, you can get true life. I wish that for you.</p>
