  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>What do you mean "avoid things that disturb your mind"? I've learned one of the patterns that got me into the mess I'm in was avoiding the problems in my life.</em></p>
<p>What is the primary negative mind state at any time — what's the main sickness? If you go to a Traditional Chinese Doctor (or indeed almost any traditional doctor), they will ask you what the main issue is. This is generally the first thing you treat.</p>
<p>If your mind is flying around and your feelings are out of control, that is probably the first main thing to take care of. When you're out of control like this it is difficult to function, difficult to do yourself any good. Or if you do, it is likely to be by happy accident rather than by seeing clearly and acting directly.</p>
<p>Before you can see clearly, you have to get somewhat stable and centered; so in that case you need to avoid things that whip you up into a frenzy. <em>Unless</em> you are in a safe structure of practice or therapy, with a guide, and a clear intent. In some therapeutic sessions, for instance, you may indeed break down in order to piece yourself back together. But that is a special situation, with special factors that can steer you back to some semblance of stability and clarity. On your own, as you say, it is harder to find your way through.</p>
<p>So if the primary issue is that your mind is disturbed, then you need to protect your mind.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean you completely shut down. That's what the movement practice is for. That's what self-expression, like therapy, journaling, talking with friends, writing poetry, dancing your story — that's what these things are for. In proper measure.</p>
<p>Yes, facing issues in your life is necessary; it's the way to health and maturity. But in proper measure. You do the part you can do, and maybe one step more.</p>
<p>When a person's center is strong, they can tackle all kinds of difficulty and yet they quickly return to balance. It's not that expert meditators and spiritual masters never have difficulty. It's not even that they never get disturbed (though for some rare beings that's true). But it's that they quickly return. They have practiced letting go so well that nothing sticks to them; nothing controls them for very long.</p>
<p>If your mind goes around, around, always affected by outer circumstances and inner thoughts, that means your center is not strong. Therefore you have to protect yourself more, and find situations that can guide you. You arrange your living space and schedule to help you stay clear. You commit to certain tasks of self-care or certain healthy habits. You seek out stable individuals as companions and guides. You build a team of allies. You go toward activities that help you be real; you avoid activities that agitate you and steer you away from your task of healing.</p>
<p>These things can help you develop a stronger center; but really some kind of practice is eventually required — something that will bring you out of your head and into reality. Taiji is good. Prostrations are good. Meditation is good. Tools developed through therapy are good. But you have to find the one or ones that you can do.</p>
<p>Then as your center becomes stronger, as you gain the ability to disengage from mental objects and return to neutral, you will be able to face more and more of life. It's like having a good compass: when you have confidence that you can 'find North' at any time, you can venture out into the wilderness. Before then, you need to develop your ability.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>You also talk about being and staying grounded... ...I know that's what I need I just can't frigging get there.</em></p>
<p>Let's go back to the start of my first reply to you, and take care with language. You can't because you say you can't. Your story and your speech make your reality. But if you let go of "I can't", then already groundedness appears.</p>
<p>So <em>be careful with your speech!</em></p>
<p>People who experience ungroundedness (which is most of us) tend to doubt their ground. Actually, you have your ground quite often, you just don't believe it. Then you check it, you think "Well, this can't be it. It doesn't feel <em>enough</em>," and you set off a chain of thought that takes you away. But actually you have a good ability to come back. The evidence for this is that you can write and speak cogently, you can take in my words and consider them, and you can fashion a response. If you had <em>no</em> groundedness you wouldn't be in reality at all, you would just be flying around.</p>
<p>Groundedness is very, very simple. I don't mean to say that it's easy in the sense that you should have the hang of it already; I mean that it is not a complicated matter. It is very plain, not fancy, not special.</p>
<p>The moment you hear something clearly, you are grounded in hearing. The moment you touch something clearly, you are grounded in touch. And so on, with all your senses. Also, when you perceive your thinking clearly (which I know is not always easy), at that moment you are grounded in thinking: you are the witness, perceiving what's happening, not someone being pulled by the nose.</p>
<p>That's why I recommend having something in your pocket or on your body that you can touch and feel and work, something that can bring you back to a simple moment. You can feel the smoothness of a rock or the softness of a piece of fur; and in that moment you are grounded.</p>
<p>It's also why I recommend practices that bring you down to the literal ground, the earth: Taiji, Yoga, prostrations, walking, feeling feet-on-the-floor. These bring your body to the earth, and bring your energy down out of the head where it is always causing problems. When your energy is down lower, in your belly or your feet, your moments are simple. "Oh, I'm just here." And that's all. Then when something comes up, you can deal with it simply: At eating time, you eat. Sleeping time, sleep. Working time, work. Resting time, rest.</p>
<p>It's just that you don't believe in your own groundedness. When you do body scans you think there must be something else you need, so you abandon the plain reality and you follow trains of thought. Maybe you expect reality to never have sadness or agitation or fear or rage. Maybe you expect something special to happen. Groundedness means being <strong><em>as-is</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For a moment, be as-is. You don't have to know what that is in your thinking. What color is in front of your face? What sound is arising and passing? What is the feeling at your feet? This is already ground.</p>
