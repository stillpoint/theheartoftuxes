  <h1>Consistently meditating for 2+ years. How to move to next level?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Is surrendering to a guru really a good idea?</em></p>
<p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>
<p>Are you taking issue with something in my comment in particular, or is this a comment meant for the subreddit at large? I haven't said that anyone should "surrender to a guru"; so that seems to be your own axe to grind. If you put down stories and imagined scenarios, what is your actual experience?</p>
<p>Not that problematic or harmful situations never develop in teacher-student relationships; but this is an issue in all institutions in all parts of the world. There is, however, an additional risk when potential students attach to a teacher just because he/she is foreign, or exotic, or presumably "enlightened", or in a position of authority. The correct course of action is to be aware and to take responsibility for your own well-being and spiritual progress. If a school or teacher does not encourage self-responsibility, I would hope alarm bells would go off in the student's head and that they would seek clarification before proceeding further.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of meditation teachers, in many different forms of student-teacher relationships, within many different styles and traditions (and there are also some who shun tradition). Surrender to a guru is a very specific tradition with very specific goals and effects. It is not correct by any means to suggest that meditation teachers are all gurus who demand surrender.</p>
<p>It is also not correct to foist a shallow, perverted interpretation of the <em>guru</em>-aspirant relationship onto the many very sincere, very compassionate, and transcendently wise teachers who take on that role for the sake of their students. There are many resources available for further study of the guru systems in various traditions; some of the great luminaries in world history have come out of a guru system. But by the same token a guru is not mandatory for the study and practice of meditation.</p>
<p>Also, we should be clear on the term "Master". The mastery referred to is mastery of the self, not mastery over another person such as a slave-driver might have. A Master has seen into his or her own true nature, and is able to function beyond the bounds of illusory self-image (which is often mistakenly referred to as "ego"). This is not to say that all Masters have the same level of attainment, nor even that all Masters are completely free of habit, neurosis, attachment and the like. It is just that a Master is able to correct herself/himself much more quickly than the rest of us, and may function from pure compassionate intent for extended periods rather than being subject to the vagaries of mundane life.</p>
<p>An often fearful and reactive defensiveness raises its head in discussions where people try to decide once and for all whether a certain way of life or practice or religion or tradition is "good" or "bad". Those black-and-white terms are childish, and ironically point to a self-identity that doesn't have enough confidence to venture into a real-life exploration.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The list of "life-hating, toxic and medicinal meditations" you quoted has some very good points, but also some mistakes. It is life-hating to calm down — really? All devotion is toxic — really? Correct meditation instruction in fact addresses the important points in that list; and if you read my previous posts you will see a consistent response to them: correct meditation does not block or force or avoid anything; correct meditation is not blankness; correct meditation is not destruction of the ego.</p>
<p>Your concern for the psychological health of seekers is very valid. In the early days of Asian religions in America, many masters only knew the way of their old culture, which may (or may not) have been appropriate in that culture but which created many problems for westerners. Nowadays, western psychological and sociological knowledge is being integrated into Asian forms, and new adaptations are arising. In addition, those teaching through legitimate traditional forms are undergoing a greater level of scrutiny (both from within their schools and from the broader community) to ensure the proper unfolding of their students.</p>
<p>It is a work in progress, and hinges upon the will to look closely and unflinchingly at what is really going on. As Dr. Phil is wont to say, "Y'all can't change what ya don't acknowledge!" This is a two-way street, though; and clinging to fear-based opinions and imaginings about sinister "gurus" is just as much to blame for our shared predicament. We humans hate uncertainty; so without actual experience, it is very easy for us to cling to an opinion. We are comforted by the decisive quality of the opinions we hold; and we often treasure them more than we treasure <em>finding out the truth</em>.</p>
<p>If you were to actually meet and spend time with any of the many thousands of true teachers of meditation, you could see for yourself the extent of their gift to us as well as the extent of their human failings. This is much, much better than drumming up theoretical arguments on an internet forum. Actual experience is ten thousand times better than clinging to an idea. And if you are to have a true experience, you have to be willing to suspend that clinging, even if only temporarily. Otherwise, what you will be experiencing is your own ignorance, and it will continue until a big enough life event penetrates that filter. For many, unfortunately, it is not until a catastrophe befalls them that they let go of previous opinions and begin to look openly.</p>
