  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I get severe migraines, in and out of practice; and I know that it's not only possible to meditate with extreme pain, but in some ways the pain can bring extraordinary focus — <em>if</em> you know what to do with your mind.</p>
<p>The 'throwing things at the wall' approach, though common, is not conducive to clarity. There is the doubt that comes with lack of step-by-step knowledge of cause and effect (the <em>reasons</em> why aspects of the practice bring forth particular results). And there is the doubt of wondering which method is best, or if a method is any good at all. And there is the doubt about whether you're doing it right. And there is the doubt of knowing that your own best guesses are limited even if they happen to be correct. And there is the doubt of not having evidence for the fruitfulness of a practice — not having it vouched for by an attained practitioner, and not having its attainment displayed for you as living proof.</p>
<p>There are a couple of pitfalls we encounter with these doubts: we don't necessarily know how to help ourselves, and we may push and struggle in our sincere effort to compensate for lack of clarity.</p>
<p>From a wider perspective, we may consider whether the clouded mind within meditation is another facet of a broader life pattern of unclarity, a pattern that allows you to accept random sources of advice and uncertain application of method. The way you use your mind in life tends to be the way your mind behaves in meditation, unless you are conscious of the issue and take steps to counteract it.</p>
<p>We all have something; we all have some flaw and pattern. For some it will be aggression; for others, desire and grasping; and for yet others the resident pattern will be uncertainty, ambivalence, or confusion. These reflect the three categories of delusion: we hungrily grasp at things we like; we aggressively avoid or destroy things we don't like; and we numb out to things that are neutral for us. These three 'poisons', as they are termed in Buddhism, are what we cure with proper meditation.</p>
<p>Proper meditation does not clamor after anything. Pleasant experience is allowed to arise and pass. We maintain the discipline of non-grasping with the mind.</p>
<p>Proper meditation does not run away from or try to aggressively manipulate any experience or situation. Unpleasant experience is allowed to arise and pass. We remain stable.</p>
<p>Proper meditation does not ignore anything. Neutral experience is allowed to arise and pass; <em>but</em>, we stay aware of it. Open, non-judging awareness is maintained moment to moment to moment.</p>
<p>The pattern of becoming sleepy during meditation, if it's not caused by physiological or lifestyle issues like disease or poor sleep or insufficient exercise, is often indicative of the <em>avoiding</em> or <em>ignoring/confused</em> 'mind poisons'. For instance, if we habitually look for excitement or sensual pleasure, the mind and even the body may become so habituated to the addictive seeking of idealized objects that when you just sit with <em>reality</em> it is experienced as distasteful, and the consciousness shuts down and becomes dull. "If you're not going to feed me cheesecake I'm checking out!" We all have our 'cheesecake', our pursuit.</p>
<p>A lot of people experience this kind of sleep-like state when they have to face something difficult. Whether it's a conversation about changing or ending a relationship, or acknowledging a sickness or possibility of death, or — for many of us — feeling emotions we've tried to push away, we may often get quite drowsy and dull when it comes time to face these things. And what is meditation if not facing reality? Sometimes even chronic pain, illness, or life difficulties are really just our own way of sabotaging our awareness: we create almost any problem so we won't have to face ourselves directly; we always have an 'out', a reason why we can't do it.</p>
<p>If this is the pattern in your case, one remedy is to recognize the pattern, and to be quite clear in both your intent and your method, continuing to apply attention moment to moment to moment. I had sleepy sittings for a couple of years before finally breaking through; but I'm glad I didn't give up.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other possible reasons for both the headaches and the cloudy unclarity. A single, proper, definite method will be a mirror for you, and will reflect clearly to you what the problem is. When your practice form is very clear, then it's very clear when you depart from it. You will be able to see when you depart, and why. This means you will be able to see, over time, your patterns. But if your form is not clear, it will be much more difficult to perceive how your mind is relating to the practice. You will not know when you're 'in' and when you're 'out'.</p>
<p>Have you ruled out physical and lifestyle issues? Seen a doctor?</p>
<p>Next, posture can make these kinds of things easier or more difficult. Your posture can help you wake up or it can encourage you to go to sleep. Your posture can add stress and tension the causes and exacerbates headaches, or it can bring forth tremendous ease from being able to settle and let go. Proper training in posture is another reason to learn from one good, traditional source.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend physical practice to all meditators, but especially in cases like yours where there is (A) difficulty in sitting or (B) possible stagnation. Prostrations and/or practices like Yoga or Taiji are superb companion practices for sitting; and over time they can promote a much stronger flow in you, which could help tremendously with both headaches and unclarity. Just the fact that you get your blood moving and oxygenated can only be of benefit. Add the relaxed, grounded ease that comes after whole-body activity, and physical practice becomes a kind of medicine.</p>
