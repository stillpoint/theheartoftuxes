  <h1>How to meditate longer?</h1>

<p>That's great that you intend to find a teacher. A good teacher helps tremendously; and even a not-so-good teacher can help a lot if you don't attach to their words and actions. (And you can help your teacher as well.)</p>
<p>So why do more meditation? What is meditation for?</p>
<p>I've written a lot on posture. You can search my post history for several detailed posts; or if you do a general search for  the term 'posture' in the Meditation and Buddhism subreddits you'll likely find some of my posts.</p>
<p>The advice to keep the back and neck straight is a simplification of a more nuanced teaching. Really what is meant is to be upright. But in the translation from East Asian languages to English, and in the transmission of some formalistic samurai-like lineages, the instruction to <em>straighten</em> appeared. It can be helpful, in countering the tendency to compress and slump, to let the spine gently extend. It stretches vertically, and finds an equilibrium where the quite heavy head is at rest atop it, neither jutting forward nor tensely pulled back.</p>
<p>But what often happens is that the meditator envisions a straight line, and tries to push the body into that formation. This creates tension. The spine is not naturally straight. It has supportive curves, like the arches of the Golden Gate Bridge. To straighten the spine goes against its nature and its strength, requiring muscular effort to hold the position.</p>
<p>A similar simplification happens with the instruction to pull the chin back. This can't be a universal generalization, but it is often spoken of as if it is! The instruction was meant to counteract the jutting head and chin that appear when the meditator slumps. If you slump and give up tone in the core and in the neck, you will find the neck compresses and the chin juts out. To counteract this, teachers instructed their students to pull the chin back. But if your head is balanced well, pulling the chin back will destroy the natural curve of the neck and create tension. So, much better to feel the head resting lightly atop the spine than trying to push it into some cookie cutter ideal.</p>
<p>I often encourage meditators to emulate a graceful mountain, like Mount Fuji: The base is absolutely, firmly at rest. It is solid by virtue of surrendering to gravity. The solidity of a mountain is not 'held' or contrived. It is settled. The weight has come down to its bottom. Next, the upper areas are open to space. The upper part of the mountain wafts up gracefully, with a very pure and fresh feeling, and a sense of nobility. So the feeling is at once light and noble, but absolutely grounded at rest. Simple but not serious.</p>
<p>If you look at a mountain or any rock formation, take in both its weight and its openness. See and feel that there's no show there; the formation is not trying to be something in particular. It has just settled into its natural stability.</p>
<p>If you sit like this, you need not do anything else with your mind. This is already both relaxed and alert in the present moment. It is complete, high-level meditation. But if you have a method, follow the method. You can use this as a way of connecting with posture, but don't doubt or waver from your method.</p>
<p>I feel it is also important for meditators to listen to their bodies more than to classical instructions. The classical instructions are like a framework, a reminder of the points to be visited. But when the framework is taken literally it can be too rigid. You have to become sensitive to where tension begins to arise, and why. In order to listen well, you have to start from neutral — or as close to neutral as you can muster. This is another reason why sitting down with a relaxed, regular, plain and simple, everyday kind of mind is important: you don't bring junk into the sitting. If you immediately start putting yourself into an arrangement based on classical instructions — ears have to be in line with shoulders, nose in line with the lower belly, back straight, and so on — it will be difficult to feel what is actually happening with the alignment. But if you settle down as if you're just plopping down to do nothing in particular, it's possible to feel how the skeleton and what it carries can stack up upon itself without adding unnecessary tension. You can reach a condition of bodymind relaxation, right from the start.</p>
<p>The other thing I was going to write above is that traditionally, walking, working, and other active meditations are interspersed with sitting. After a certain time (most find it after 40 to 60 minutes) the mind tends toward stagnation, and the energy becomes less bright. Some people start to nod off at this point, and in their dozing dreaming they feel they are doing 'deep' meditation; but really it is a backward step into dullness and loss of awareness. Because of this, movement and a change of perspective are brought in to help the mind stay bright and engaged.</p>
<p>So a very good, balanced way of doing more practice is to do shorter sittings with another physical practice in between. You can do walking meditation, or you can try prostration practice. Both are very good. Prostration pratice is almost like a shortcut, because it helps the energy to settle so strongly.</p>
<p>Walking practice comes in many forms. You can focus on the feet, or you can continue the practice you do while sitting, but do it while walking. In any case, if you learn a particular meditation correctly, you should adopt the accompanying walking or moving meditation offered in that style or lineage. Practices within the same lineage tend to have a synergy; they are designed to work well together.</p>
<p>Sitting tends to train depth. Walking and moving tends to train broader mindfulness. Sitting promotes calmness; movement promotes flow. Sitting participates in absolute purity; movement brings that purity into relationship and into all of life. And walking or other movement helps to relieve the body and prepare it for more sitting in the subsequent session. When I consulted one teacher about doing a solo retreat, she asked about my schedule and said "Yes, good, walking periods are good. You will turn the Earth Energy."</p>
