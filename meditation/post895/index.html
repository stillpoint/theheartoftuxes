  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>These are good questions, but I am not your teacher, and people on this forum are not your teacher. If you don't have the time to find a teacher, how do you have time to do unclear meditation? Some more effort is necessary.</p>
<p>Change "I can't" to "I can"... and "I will".</p>
<p>If you want to seek out a method in a book or on the internet, first get clear on your aim (maybe consider the aims that I listed in my post), then research and choose <em>one</em> proven traditional method that addresses your aim.</p>
<p>You say that you sometimes focus on breath; sometimes you focus on sounds around you; sometimes on 'one' sound like a bird chirping (but is that one sound or several interrupted sounds?); sometimes you listen to binaural beats; sometimes you focus on the beats; and sometimes you get a visual that you focus on.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing on many different things is not</strong> <strong><em>focusing.</em></strong> It is moving about here and there with your attention.</p>
<p>So we can see the causes of disturbance in meditation: unclarity about the aim, unclarity about the method, and meandering between methods. So without clarity in the stucture, how can the structure help you to be clear and stable? It is like trying to drive a car that sometimes has wheels and sometimes umbrellas, sometimes gas and sometimes milkshake, sometimes a metal chassis and sometimes a cigar box: very difficult to drive!</p>
<p>Or perhaps more experientially, it is like trying to develop stability in life while constantly moving house, bringing your clothes and toiletries and bedding to one place and then another, then back again. If you are very expert and already stable in your mind, it is possible to make use of and enjoy the different homes; but it is not conducive to stability. There is no consistency, no focus, no set basis upon which to build a life. It is the same in meditation. Clarity of intent and form, and consistency of application, are direct conditions for clarity and stability of mind.</p>
<p>You, and many — <em>most!</em> — of us are attached to mental states. Of course! We want to feel good, and hold onto that feeling; and we want to avoid feeling bad, and escape that feeling. And whatever is neither clearly good or bad feeling, we just ignore. This is why we are not free. We are constantly chasing, avoiding, and ignoring. Life controls us. We don't decide based on benefit, happiness, or god forbid <em>compassion for others</em>; we are habitually controlled by liking, disliking, and ignoring.</p>
<p>So it's not that we don't seek clarity or peace, and so on. But the way we seek it should not be either a 'seeking' by grasping, a 'seeking' by avoiding, or an ignoring what's really here (because we're occupied by our seeking agenda). This is where we have to use rationality and knowledge; we have to understand how meditation functions. By letting go of the grip and being very open about <em>all</em> feelings and <em>all</em> mental states, we find stability.</p>
<p>In other words, chasing a mental state is in itself instability. It is object-relationship: you pick one imaginary thing to achieve in the imaginary future, and you steer your resources toward it, rather than simply being aware and unmoved by anything in the moment.</p>
<p>&gt; Truth has no flavor.</p>
<p>So this is an important point, if you want all the benefits of meditation. If you want all benefits, you must put down all wanting. Truth has no particular flavor. As the Hindus say, "<em>neti, neti</em>": "It's not this, it's not that."</p>
<p>Likewise, the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart said "If I had a God I could understand, I would no longer consider him God."</p>
<p>So if you hold an idea or image and try to make or grasp it, that is not 'God', not Truth, not Wisdom, not stability, not equanimity. The method is not for getting or making; it is for letting go and letting be. One object (if you use an object) is the focus, and everything else is let go of. And even this one object is to be approached with equanimity: it is just an opportunity to return; one doesn't try and make it into something.</p>
<p>If your method is correct, the benefits will appear by themselves. The thinking will settle down. Peace and comfort will emerge. Non-contrived experience will become the basis of your life, rather than something you made up; and that will lead to utter confidence. The mind will merge with the object, or seem to — because the mind and object originally are not separate. Insight into subject/self and object will appear spontaneously. Powers and attainments will grow.</p>
<p>But if you then attach to any of <em>these</em> as objects, you again lose it. The way is very pure. You can't hold anything. It is your non-holding that is the power.</p>
<p>Saying that you want to get "all the benefits" is not yet clear, and it is also a bit greedy. The higher benefits of boundless wisdom, great compassionate activity, and enlightenment for all come from generosity and humility, not from <em>getting</em>. They are beyond-self, not selfish.</p>
<p>So take note of exactly what you expect at the moment, and also consider the other higher aims; and then slowly clarify <em>what you're on about</em>. What is your life really for? What do you actually want to contribute effort to? This will give you a better sense of aim or motivation, and thus the kind of meditation necessary.</p>
<p>Do you care if the meditation you learn is couched in a religious framework? There are so many methods, many good ones and many fine-but-shallow ones, and also many shoddy, unclear ones. Likewise, among people who are conveying these methods online, some have a right to speak with certainty about the method and many are only making guesses, however well-intentioned. You have to be self-responsible here and do your proper research. It will pay off in freedom from doubt when you are practicing, which will directly translate to mental stability, concentration, and attainment.</p>
