  <h1>Can't go deep into inner body</h1>

<p>Some people can get by, mixing methods; but I've never seen any of them progress far. There are inherent risks to trying to blend various teachings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It develops a controlling attitude, where you try to arrange your mind and your progress. Thinking that you can make your own practice cocktail by choosing some ingredients from column A and some from column B, or that going according to whim can be any kind of foundation for overcoming egocentric patterns is just dead wrong in most cases. The correct attitude is one of greater simplicity and acceptance rather than increased manipulation or self-involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not necessarily clear that the paths or methods have the same purpose or are meant to cover the same territory in the same order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may bring about confusion about your experiences and their origin. It may be more difficult to perceive the connection between the <em>effects</em> of progress, regression, or a mood or issue that appears gradually, and the <em>causes</em> present in each particular method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may also generate more <em>different</em> experiences and issues than you can digest well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From what you write, it seems that you may not be very clear on the purpose and function of the "inner body" meditation you're doing. You write that peace and love reside <em>only</em> in the body, and that connection with the body can make you invulnerable to the world. Your statements indicate a certain divisive or dualistic view that may eventually lead you down the wrong path. The statements are not necessarily true, and sound more like repeating what someone else is saying instead of understanding the true part of the statement.</p>
<p>But this issue is very important: to know the effects and results of the practice you undertake. How you use your mind makes your life and influences everyone. You shouldn't treat practice cheaply. Once you understand the purpose — not just accepting what someone <em>says</em> it's supposed to do, but actually understanding the cause and effect of the method — then you can be in a position to choose decisively whether this is a method that you can commit to. If so, then commit, and don't distract yourself by toying with other ways. You shouldn't be like a bodybuilder who tries to come up with the perfect blend of supplements.</p>
<p>Going deep is not achieved by heroic means in one fell swoop, nor by finding some ideal situation that suits you perfectly. It is achieved by repeated acts of commitment over a long duration. It may very well be that you or someone else can generate overwhelming feelings or dramatic experiences by pushing; but that is not what is meant by deep. That is just another meaningless distraction, and in fact if it's mistaken for true meditation it's a cheap, tawdry shame.</p>
<p>Here I think it would be valuable for you to learn the difference between <em>meditation</em> and <em>mindfulness practice</em>. Many kinds of practices are colloquially named "meditation", but very few of them are true pure meditation; many are more appropriately called concentration or contemplation or mindfulness.</p>
<p><em>Mindfulness</em> is a presence that can embrace your everyday activity, and I think this is what Eckhart Tolle is teaching with his inner body exercise — a method by which you can return to the present moment and stay present while functioning in your daily life. I may be mistaken on this because I have only limited experience with Tolle's teachings, but you should check if this is the case: with this method you are not meant to dive deeper and deeper into the internal sensations or try to turn something up from the depths; you are just meant to have an object that can establish a continuous background awareness so that you can go about your day naturally. Trying to make your mind go deeper into internal sensations will actually act as a distraction from your presence with the business of your everyday activity.</p>
<p>As you continue to maintain that background awareness, <em>by itself</em> it will deepen; i.e., it will gradually become more stable and will perceive more subtle layers of sensation and energy. You don't go looking for it or trying to make it happen; it happens through your consistent application of the method.</p>
<p>In <em>meditation</em>, you may adopt a special environment and posture at a particular time in order to then look deeply without engaging in work or play or relationship. Even then, a meditation that focuses on emotions has an inherently unbalanced quality. In some cases it can be used to heal the emotions or to further the emotional aspect of awakening; but a more neutral, open-handed meditation is the more pure and central approach.</p>
<p>Eckhart Tolle's inner body method seems similar to the Buddhist teachings of mindfulness of the body (<em>kaya-sati</em>). There may be a connection worth investigating. These teachings have been systematized very well, with clear description of the method, its purpose, and the causality of it — <em>why</em> it works a certain way, and its effects as distinct from the effects of other methods. Search the web for "Four Foundations Of Mindfulness" and the <em>Satipatthana Sutra</em>.</p>
<p>As to emotions arising, there are various possible causes. Some emotions may be lodged "below", and emerge naturally as your blockages are softened; others may be pushed up violently when you struggle with yourself; and others yet may not be there originally but are made by the stress of an improper relationship with yourself in practice (that is, you can actually make more crap than you clear away). <em>IF</em> your intent and understanding of the method are clear, and if you have some ability to regain your balance on your own, then you can confidently maintain your practice no matter what emotions arise. But if there is unclarity about why you are doing something or what it is that you're doing, or if you have mental or emotional wounds that could overwhelm you, then you need to find support and guidance before proceeding.</p>
<p>It is irresponsible for anyone to tell you precisely how you should proceed with this situation based on the little we've heard. We simply don't know what your experience is like, nor your history and character. <strong>My question for you in this regard is simple: does it seem like the practice, as you are experiencing it these days, is going in the direction of sanity?</strong> I'm not asking whether it sounds like it should work, from what you've read or heard; I'm asking for your own honest sense of it. This may guide you in taking your next steps. Start where you are.</p>
