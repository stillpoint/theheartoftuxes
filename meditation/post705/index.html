  <h1>I have decided to increase to two 21 minute sits in a row - what should I do between sits? What do you do?</h1>

<p>In practice, we try to find a balance between rigor and laxity. We try neither to push too hard, creating undue tension, nor indulge in laziness, letting standards slump and base urges<em> take control. The real balance point, though, is very often more rigorous than we think. In general, our society is very lazy and distracted, so returning to our natural mind can </em>feel* unnatural simply because it is uncommon. Proper effort is somewhat foreign to us, so it feels like an imposition; we usually expect something less disciplined. So that's something to take into account when seeking a "perfect formula" in practice: if it's based on how you feel you may fall short. (And we should do away with the notion of a perfect formula or ideal situation.)</p>
<p>Having said that, I think that two 21 minute sits could be a wonderful ongoing practice. If you keep it up daily, this is great. And then occasionally you may want to challenge yourself with a longer sitting, more sitting periods, or committing to a retreat schedule for a day or several days.</p>
<p>Sitting is a way of re-setting, letting the mind return to its neutral, clear, ungrasped state. Meditators with some experience often find that the mind becomes more settled and quiet over the course of a sitting, to the point where there may be some sense of being interrupted, or even disappointment if the sitting is "too short" — they like to experience the more profound quiet that they experience when the sitting goes beyond, say, 30 or 40 minutes. Very capable meditators actually progress through stages of absorption, which requires varying durations of sitting according to the speed with which the meditator passes through the various stages.</p>
<p>But after some time in sitting, another kind of re-setting can be helpful, which is returning to movement. Absorption (or we can also say concentration, or settling of mind) may deepen, but after a time it also often happens that clarity of presence dulls. One may merge well with one's object of meditation, but it can take on a sleepy quality after a while. Some meditators, in some systems, don't mind that sleepy quality. Some may even mistake it for a level of attainment or attach to it because it is pleasant. But this aspect of awakening also requires balance.</p>
<p>So introducing some circulation, some vibrancy, some movement can help balance the ever-downward settling and stagnation of only sitting. So yes, moving your body with stretches or free movement or walking can be a good practice between sittings. During retreat or intensive weeks of practice, simply physical work (cleaning, gardening, etc.) serves a similar purpose.</p>
<p><em>Before</em> your sittings, vigorous exercise can be wonderful. It gets the blood oxygenated and circulating well through the brain, it helps the energy move smoothly through the body, it connects you to the reality of the body and helps you get out of the illusory thinking world, and it helps the energy come down — after vigorous exercise you naturally want to sit down and settle. But <em>between</em> sittings, you may not want to move so vigorously that the energy that has settled in sitting is stirred up again. Something gentle will move the energy without undoing the calm centeredness developed in the first sitting; then you can progress and possibly go even deeper in the second sitting.</p>
<p>(I don't like to talk about "deeper" and "shallower" because it may suggest that you should try to get a certain state, and that you fail if you don't achieve it. That's not the case. You should only be open and faithful to the method, moment to moment. Don't make the mistake of trying to make depth happen.)</p>
<p>Another very good aspect of gentle mindful movement or walking meditation is that it helps to form a bridge between sitting meditation and everyday activity. Having developed some centeredness under the ideal conditions of sitting, you can then try it out in activity, without immediately facing the barrage of demands and distractions in daily life. Going into meditation and then bringing the meditative mind into activity, and repeating that cycle often, develops your ability as a clear and compassionate human — you learn to move freely between the meditative depths and society, unattached to either realm, and so you can offer your clarity and calmness and true action to everyone.</p>
<p>It is very common in many meditation centers, across many traditions, to have walking meditation between sittings. Most commonly in my experience there will be a 5 minute walking between sittings of anywhere from 20 minutes to 40 minutes. Longer sittings may be separated by walking periods of 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The walking period is not a rest period where you deflate and take a break. If you need to deflate and take a break, then you should look into why there is so much tension and difficulty in the sittings, and do what you can to make the relationship more natural. But in the walking period you should also do your utmost to maintain the method. This can be a dedicated walking meditation method (usually paying meticulous attention to the movements and sensations of the feet), or it can simply be maintaining the same method you use for sitting while you walk. If you opt for a walking period, choose one method and stick to it; meditation period is not the time to play around with methods, it is the time to wake up.</p>
<p>Please avoid reading or any engagement with words after meditation. In a few seconds you could undo the benefit gained over an hour of effort. Meditation moves in the direction of your original, natural mind, which is clear, peaceful, and complete. So meditation moves in the direction of contentment. Cut off the thinking that says you need something more. When you have given a sincere effort in meditation, you have already surpassed all writings. Later, maybe verbal teachings can help organize your thinking-understanding; but your <em>actual</em> understanding is your activity — the <em>doing</em> of the meditation. This is precious. Don't sell it short by looking for more ideas! Don't cover it up by yapping about it!</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>*Note: The previously mentioned "base urges" involve the five main hindrances that humans have: attachment to eating, sleeping, sex, self-aggrandizement, and money &amp; possessions; but we can also count any urge that diverts us from attentive and compassionate presence.</p>
