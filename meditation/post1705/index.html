  <h1>Too focused on the length of each sit</h1>

<p>20 minutes is a very good sit, if you sit correctly. 5 or 10 minutes, or even just a couple of minutes is a very good sit, if you sit correctly.</p>
<p>60 minutes is often 20 minutes too long for many people. Even very experienced meditators and 'professionals' (monks) can tend to get stagnant after 30-40 minutes. But if your aspiration is strong and clear, 60 minutes is also very good.</p>
<p>In the yogic tradition of India and Tibet, it is said that 24 minutes is the ideal sitting time. Longer periods can be made of 20-minute or 24-minute sessions, divided by a short break or another practice. Physical practice should not be left out of the overall training; it is a very important part of the picture. Walking meditation, Yoga or Taiji, or prostrations practice (or any combination of them) are very good companion practices for sitting.</p>
<p>Timers go for a couple of dollars at a dollar store. Use one, and let go of fussing about timing. Just give yourself over to the practice.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can burn a short stick of incense if you don't sit too close to it. (Not only will intense scent and smoke disturb meditation, it is also unhealthy to inhale.) Use an incense meant for meditation, not the thick, sickly-sweet Indian sticks or the modern floral and other perfumed new-age types. There are many good, mild, and profound Japanese incenses. Many Tibetan incenses are also appropriate for meditation, though they produce more smoke. A short stick lasts around half an hour. If you place it upright in a bowl of ashes, you know when it's burned down because the scent changes, and you can smell the ashes for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Consistency is much more important than duration. Once practice is rock-solid consistent, duration can give opportunity for certain kinds of progress; but progress doesn't depend on duration. And if you become attached to duration or to the attainment you think you will get from a longer sitting (as it seems may be happening with you already), it can really become an obstacle rather than a benefit.</p>
<p>Your situation also highlights another problem with going out too fast and falling short: you then feel disappointed with a perfectly fine sitting, and because of the checking, comparing trains of thought that you indulge in, discouragement sets in. So, much better to start with a duration that you can keep up consistently, and feed off of the eagerness and sense of fulfillment you get with regular practice.</p>
<p>Many 30-, 40-, 60-minute sitters have either passed through a course of training or practice in a regular, ongoing group or residential setting. That is to say, there are extra supports available from a teacher, from a community of other practitioners, from regular teachings, from a practice schedule and commitment to membership, and so on. These extra supports can make longer sittings more possible without taking strain and blame on yourself.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently better about a longer sitting. <em>Meditation is momentary.</em> If you are thinking about time, already you are not momentary, you are outside of practice. Therefore, good meditation means you are keeping a momentary mind. Whether you keep that momentary mind for 15 minutes or for an hour, your responsibility is still to the moment. In fact, 15 minutes or a hour is not enough. Your true life is <em>always</em> momentary; so if you want true life, you can't limit your practice to only occasional sittings.</p>
<p>Correct motivation is the central issue. Motivation needs to be for the right purpose, and you have to connect with it personally. These two factors are both essential for your progress.</p>
<p>The right purpose means for the fulfillment of your <em>life's</em> purpose, to help all beings everywhere, not only to get something for yourself. Seeking something for yourself in meditation is called 'having a gaining idea'. It is this flaw that works its way into so many people's meditation practice. Of course it is natural and common to seek some benefit for yourself; and that is what often draws people to meditate in the first place, as they seek relief from stress, thought patterns, pain, and habits, or seek to gain concentrative power for study, or peace and calm feeling. But if meditation is only for oneself it is flawed at a very basic level, and can never progress far. One can not hold onto self-centered agenda and open to boundless reality at the same time. Not possible! One can not hold onto an idea or grasp at an ideal state and flow with change at the same time. Not possible!</p>
<p>So correct motivation increasingly moves toward compassion for all beings. "May this meditation help me become a vehicle of peace, stability, wisdom, and kindness in the world. May all beings benefit from my practice, and specifically the beings that I will encounter in the coming hours. May I become humble enough to embrace truth; may I become strong enough to voice it and act upon it."</p>
<p>Although you may understand the connection between right motivation and right practice (i.e., deep and effective practice is not possible without the right motivation), only understanding it in your thinking is not enough. This is the second part of motivation: connecting with it. It has to be watered and tended to, as you would water and tend to sprouts in a garden. The most universally respected way to connect with right motivation is recognition of impermanence. Actually taking the time to consider the tenuous and uncertain span of your life, and the certainty of your approaching death, is said by many great masters of various traditions to be the best way to clarify motivation. And when you clarify motivation — understanding the right compassionate motivation and connecting to it in your heart — then you will have no problem taking on more practice. You will want to do it; you will be eager to take on more, not only for yourself but for others. You will want to take on their share of the burden, and not only meditate but act for the sake of others. Because when you really take your impermanence to heart, you realize that this life and the moments in it are a rare and precious opportunity to live in a fully spiritual way, and nothing else matters.</p>
