  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>First of all, you should follow your chosen method. Even within vipassana, there are various methods and styles. It's very important to be free of doubt when you are meditating, so you should choose one method, learn it well from a proper, attained, verified source, and apply it meticulously.</p>
<p>Your teacher or proper source of teaching will tell you whether to keep eyes open or closed, and why.</p>
<p>Even if someone here is clear enough, wise enough, experienced enough, and free enough from their own concepts and opinions to provide the right response within their practice, <em>they do not know your practice</em>. Even a teacher will only be able to speak for a particular style or make generalizations; without knowing your particular lineage and style, they won't be able to say what is right within the context of <em>your</em> training.</p>
<p>Next, how will you know whose opinion here is right? An online forum is not the place to go for instruction on meditation method. You don't know whether someone is speaking from absolute certainty, or strong opinion, or anywhere along a wide range of inexperience or experience. You don't know <em>what</em> experience a commenter has -- whether it's narrow (within a single lineage) or broad; whether it's alone or with teachers and practitioners; whether it has been checked and verified by a master or whether it's just book-learning; whether it corresponds to reality or whether it is all filtered through the commenter's own narrow views. Go to a proper source to learn vipassana properly.</p>
<p>For those who have a teacher, an online forum or any other venue for opinions should not be used to undercut the teaching. If there is doubt, first bring it up with your teacher. Help your teacher to teach by bringing your doubts and questions to them. It is very auspicious for everyone when you strengthen your bond to the teacher and to the Dharma. If there is reason to doubt the teacher themselves, take it up with the school (most schools have grievance procedures in place and other authorities to whom you can go for clarification). If you doubt the entire school or practice, look at it reasonably and critically: is there another step of investigation that needs to be taken, or is this to be abandoned? You can consult other kind and experienced practitioners, but not by way of indulging your own egotistical doubt behind your teacher's back. Connection to Dharma should be strengthened, not undermined; and most sincere experienced students and teachers will point you back to your own practice and teacher.</p>
<p>Having said that, vipassana (as opposed to śamatha) is often an exception to the rule of keeping eyes open in meditation. In general, open eyes is best, and important, for several reasons. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/4300n9/comment/czeftkx">I've outlined the reasons</a> in many previous posts.) But since vipassana practice tends to key on sensations within a body scan, the realm of operation is different than most other practices. Closed eyes keeps the attention within the realm of operation: 'internal' sensation.</p>
<p>One will still have to counteract the strong tendency to drift and dream within closed-eye practice. The vast majority of those who drift and dream while keeping eyes closed have little to no awareness of their mind state; to them it is only 'comfortable' or even 'deep'. People will say "I go deeper with my eyes closed" without the slightest clue what 'deep' really means. They only equate depth with good feeling; and that's deluded attachment, and has nothing to do with meditation.</p>
<p>There are three forces that can counteract drifting or sleeping; they are important at all times in practice, but they become all the more critical when eyes are closed: <strong>strong concentration</strong>, <strong>very clear motivation</strong>, and <strong>very clear and clearly applied form</strong>.</p>
<p>In many (not all) vipassana training paths, <strong>concentration</strong> is developed independently through śamatha practice even before vipassana is attempted. Before one is thrust into a situation where the mind is more prone to wavering, the concentration is trained to at least a preliminary stability. You can see the integrity of the traditional path of training, and how it accounts for the excesses and deficiencies of its chosen forms -- everything is meant to work together; which is yet another reason why learning online or from a book is far inferior to learning in a live traditional setting (and in most cases figuring practice out alone is altogether incomplete and insufficient).</p>
<p><strong>Clear motivation</strong> means knowing and holding in your heart <em>the reason for doing meditation practice</em>. If meditation is only for oneself, only to get a temporarily nice feeling or situation or self-improvement, that will never have the power to overcome the deeply ingrained habits and tendencies within one's psyche. The motivation is all based on self, so it can't overcome self. But when one truly has broad compassionate intent -- a heartfelt pity for the plight of all beings and a living vow to wake up and save them all -- this transforms the practice from selfish to selfless. It is a powerful Dharmic energy that takes the place of the wavering ego. This energy -- when applied with continuous effort -- has the power to overcome our incredibly deep attachments to sleep, self-delusion, and avoidance.</p>
<p>Besides the tendency to sleeping and dreaming, closed eyes also tend to maintain the delusion of separateness: the sense that 'I' am in here and 'the world' is out there. Any kind of isolation, from closing the eyes to avoiding new teaching and avoiding relationships and group practice that could lead to transformation, tends to maintain the strong decision of separate selfhood. This too becomes an unconscious strategy: one thinks one is preserving one's practice, but one is actually acting out of egotism and fear of change -- unwillingness to let broad, unknown, ungraspable life <em>in</em>. In this aspect as well, correct motivation is found to be absolutely essential. Without a real, heartfelt vow of selfless compassion, the ego's agenda of self-isolation, self-aggrandizement, and control becomes dominant.</p>
<p><strong>Clear form</strong> is the mirror for your mind. When you have clear form, you can know whenever you depart from it; but when the form is unclear, your drifting will have no mirror -- you mind will wander or become dull, and there will be no accountability, nothing to bring you awareness of your mental state. Furthermore, when the form is clear you become free of doubt. At any moment, regardless of what thoughts or emotions or visions or energetic manifestations arise, you will know what you're supposed to be doing with your bodymind. The value of this clarity can't be overstated. Without it, you are left trying to figure out a strategy at a time when you are supposed to be meditating; and in fact, a great many meditators use thinking about strategy as a way of escaping the practice -- it becomes an ego-building activity; they think they are being clever when in fact they are only playing games with thought rather than performing meditation.</p>
<p>All meditation has the <em>why</em> and the <em>how</em>. These two have to work together. One is not capable of inventing one's own practice, because these points are not yet clear. If they were <em>already</em> clear, one wouldn't need the practice! But because we are already starting from a place of ignorance, we need proper teaching and integral practice -- practice in which both the why and the how are taught and developed together.</p>
<p>And we, most of us, also need living examples of how it's done, how the practice is brought to life, and how attainment is realized. So we need to be around people at all levels of practice: sincere practitioners who are struggling at the beginning yet glowing in their sincerity, very devoted and matured practitioners who have attained many of the fruits of practice, and masters who embody the boundless liberated mind and compassionate heart to which the practice leads.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As to what "feels unnatural": this is an extremely common misconception; i.e., that it's all supposed to feel natural. Meditation is bringing you into new territory. That's its function. If it kept you in your old familiar territory, it wouldn't be worth much (though people inevitably try to make it work that way).</p>
<p>We like to talk and think about how magnificently we will change, but when it comes to actual change, wet are not so inclined. It's not that the practice or result of meditation is unnatural, but that it is <em>unusual</em>. This is an important difference! We've been using our minds in unnatural, perverse, object-obsessed ways for ages! We grab at what we think we like, we run away from or try to kill what we think we don't like, and we numb out to what we think of as neutral or insignificant.</p>
<p>This has become our 'normal'. But it is not normal, not natural. So when we are wisely required to start behaving in a truly natural way -- not clinging, not avoiding, not ignoring -- it feels 'unnatural' to us.</p>
<p>Well, that's why it's a practice. It's not just couch potato time; it has actual transformative power. That transformation has a price: we go through new territory, we let go of old comfortable habits of self-isolation, sensual attachment, conceptual attachment, and so on.</p>
<p>Open eyes practice calls on you to <em>apply</em> your equanimity and non-grasping, non-avoiding attention. To the degree that you are not comfortable with that, you will feel it as 'unnatural'; but once you build your equanimity and non-grasping attention, it will be no problem. In fact it will be an embodiment of your awakened nature.  </p>
