  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>First, let's define our terms. 'Helpful' in what way; what kind of help is expected?</p>
<p>Of the people who respond to your question, how many have a great deal of experience with retreats and have made a great deal of progress on the spiritual path? Someone who has not themselves made much progress — and I don't mean just spending time for years doing meditation, but actually transforming one's life from selfishness to compassion, from ignorance to embodied wisdom-in-action — is not qualified to speak on what benefits this progress; it would be mere speculation. Someone who has not had considerable retreat experience likewise can only guess or project based on thin evidence.</p>
<p>You have a mental image of retreat as being so peaceful and serene that you will become attached to it. Is that the case? Retreat is not necessarily sensually serene; it is your application of mental serenity that makes it so. Whether you attach to that is a point of practice; it is your responsibility, not a function of the external world. Are you saying that you don't want to shield yourself from noisy city life, but you want to shield yourself from this challenge in practice?</p>
<p><em>Retreat</em> doesn't mean retreat from life. It means retreat from ignorance. One seeks out conditions that benefit practice, and lets go of many distractions from it. Consider the immensity of the path — how far one has to go to reach full enlightenment (if that is the goal), or even to attain ongoing clarity — and then have a look at how much of life is dedicated to the pursuit. From the very limited and completely uncertain time left in life (for we may die this year, or tomorrow), subtract time spent sleeping and preparing for sleep, time spent taking care of basic physical needs like eating and washing, time spent with work, time spent with family concerns, time spent in transit, time spent in entertainment or vegging out, time spent shopping and organizing and fixing and chasing down other goals, and time spent in limbo between all these activities....</p>
<p>Of the sliver of time actually available for practice after you subtract all that, first: do you actually do the practice, and second: how solid and clear is the practice?</p>
<p>Cause and effect are clear. If it is important, you harness resources and gather conditions, and you apply yourself to the task. Small effort gets small result. Lax effort gets lax result. Inconsistent effort gets inconsistent result. ...And if you you want <em>transcendent, uncommon result</em> it requires transcendent, uncommon effort. The relationship between cause and result is very clear.</p>
<p>If you want to know about the potential result of retreat, look to those who have done a lot of retreat in the correct way, and have attained great results. If you want to know whether retreat is important or necessary in attaining great results, look to the activities of enlightened beings who started out just like you and me; and look to the activities of those who are well on the way to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Retreat is not only 'nicey-nice'. Again, it's not an escape from life. It's not a spa vacation; it's practice. The beneficial factors that support practice are gathered so you can apply yourself to the work of waking up. The setting is only a small part of it; significant, but small. The schedule is important and helpful, as are the form of practice, the infrastructure (accommodations, meals, organized wash stations, and other smoothly-running facilities), the presence of a capable retreat leader, the presence of other sincere practitioners, and most of all the presence of a good teacher. All of these are things that are taken care of for the sake of your practice. It is a very focused environment.</p>
<p>You find out what it is like by doing it. Don't imagine; try! There should be an orientation during which you learn what is expected and what is offered. And of course, you need to understand your practice in at least a basic way during retreat (some retreats will teach the practice step-by-step, which is also good). If you are not clear on what you are supposed to be doing moment by moment, that unclarity will permeate the retreat.</p>
<p>The central question is what you're on about: what are you <em>really</em> extending your effort toward in life? This is the basis of whether retreat is worth it or not.</p>
<p>Maybe consider not what <em>retreat</em> can do for <em>you</em>, but what you are actually going to do about the central point of life.</p>
