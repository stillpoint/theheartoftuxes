  <h1>Would some kind people help me figure out where to start?  Explanation inside</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Do you know of any mental techniques to further practice mindfulness where meditation is impractical (at work, driving, etc...)?</em></p>
<p>This is a great question. If meditation is object-based, like <em>samatha</em>/concentration meditation, then the object of meditation will compete with the objects you need to deal with in the course of your day. So there is a distinction between this kind of meditation and <em>mindfulness</em>, where you are present but your attention is not limited to a single object. In mindfulness, you deal with what is at hand. Whatever the issue of the moment is, you offer that your attention. Driving, just drive; working, just work; walking, just walk; drinking, just drink. Sometimes this is easier said than done; the current activity may have certain elements that are more distracting: lots of talking, interacting, calculating to be done at work... signs and lights and sounds while driving. Still, just keeping in mind that you want to return to the present moment will gradually strengthen your ability to stay there. Don't check the results — in a sense, the results are not your concern. Only try. Only keep returning.</p>
<p>There are some possible aids to mindulness — skillful strategies that can be used. In addition, some types of meditation are very broad and all-inclusive, so they can continue not only on the meditation mat but also throughout the day. For example, self-inquiry meditation, where one tries to find the "self" at the center of all experience, can make use of any experience. The sights, sounds, thoughts — any experiences at all throughout the day — are traced back to the center. One big question "Who?" embraces all of life. This meditation, though, is best undertaken by someone who already has a certain aspiration and either ability or will to keep returning to the questioning; for others the meditation may be an additional burden or difficulty. That is, it may not lead to calmness and balance for those who are not suited to it. But still, it is useful to know (maybe for future reference) that there are meditation styles that are not oriented to a single object, and can embrace all activities.</p>
<p>There are many tools or strategies for assisting mindfulness, most of which have to do with providing a sort of anchor for awareness. So we distinguish between <em>awareness</em>, which exists in the present moment embracing every experience, and <em>attention</em>, which goes directly to a single object at a time.</p>
<p>Some of these mindfulness tools are mental. Mantra is a good example. Mantra literally means "mind protection". One phrase of syllables is repeated over and over throughout one's day and throughout one's activities. The effort to keep the mantra going in the background helps return one to the present moment. If one has to engage in thinking that would be difficult while performing the mantra, then one just returns to the mantra as soon as possible after the task is performed.</p>
<p>When applied with the focus of concentration, mantra becomes a concentration-style meditation. When carried in the background of daily activities, it is a mindfulness-style meditation. Some teachers describe the unification that happens with mantra: the mantra merges with one's activity; thoughts, emotions, sensations all merge with the mantra, and eventually the whole universe becomes the mantra — total unity.</p>
<p>Mantra can be helpful because it is quite clear when it is being performed and when it is not; so one can be meticulous about keeping it going. That leads to a very consistent presence, which is the protective quality — the mind never wanders far, and so the mind does not wander into danger. But some find the verbal aspect of mantra annoying, and are averse to maintaining it consistently.</p>
<p>Since mental calmness and balance is one of your aims, a physical anchor for mindfulness might be in order. If you take well to breathing meditation, there is no reason why breath shouldn't become your anchor throughout the day. Keeping a background awareness of the in-and-out of the breath should (eventually) not be too distracting from other tasks, but will still help keep you present. Whatever you are doing, you would do it with some awareness of the breath as well. This can become a beautiful dance, with the breath also responding to the changing energy of activities and situations.</p>
<p>The feedback you receive from the breath as you keep it in your awareness can also be helpful. You may start to notice better when you are anxious or tense, or when you are dull and sullen, and so you have a better chance to let go of negative states. The problem arises when you get too involved in the breath, concerned about its state or trying to manipulate it to make it more regular. This means you are trying to control your mind, and that's "bad juju" for meditation. (I've known people who have ruined their relationship with their breath this way, so that it also became uncomfortable as an object of meditation.)</p>
<p>So this brings me to my best recommendation for you: a physical anchor for mindfulness that offers perhaps a more neutral relationship for you than the breath (since the breath is so reflective of mind states, and is thus prone to self-manipulation). I recommend keeping a background awareness of your physical foundation. When standing and walking, that is the feeling of your feet on the ground. When sitting, it is the sensation of your butt on the seat and your feet on the ground. When lying down, it is the sensation of whatever body parts are in contact with the bed or support. In short, whatever your interface with gravity is, you keep some background awareness there.</p>
<p>This has many benefits. It is maybe one of the easier anchors to maintain, partly because it is a physical anchor as well — the place where your body is anchored to the earth. It helps to settle the thinking mind by bringing the energy out of the head and down into the body. And it is not subject to manipulation in the same way as breath.</p>
<p>If you want to try this, then let all of your activities have a physical root. When talking to someone, let the talking be rooted in your feet or seat. When washing dishes, let the whole bodymind, rooted in the feet, do the washing. When driving, do it from the place of stability where your seat and feet find contact.</p>
<p>If maintaining this background awareness is too difficult at first, you can let it go when you need to perform a critical task, and return to it whenever you can. At first the returning may take some effort, but soon it will become second nature, and your whole life will have more of a grounded, rooted, settled quality. Don't look for results, though. If you look for results, that means that your mind is wandering elsewhere, outside of your current situation. Only keep trying the practice. It is usually the case that significant changes are not apparent to you at first. Others may notice it, but you don't. That is fine. Your focus should just be on returning purely to the present moment. Your power and your healing are there.</p>
<p>Countless other techniques exist (one Zen master feels his thumbs on the steering wheel while driving); but these are enough. And in fact, any technique is enough if you make it enough, with your sincerity and ungrasping attitude. "Just this, right now, is okay."</p>
<p>Good luck, all of us!</p>
