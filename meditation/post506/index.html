  <h1>Something odd just happened while attempting to meditate for the first time in a while...</h1>

<p>Lying down encourages sleepiness and dreaming. If the eyes are closed the tendency is multiplied. The vast majority of meditators in dreaming states are not aware of their dreaming -- they think that's how meditation should go, and often become attached to the dullness, vagueness, or comfort of sleep. If the concentration is not stable (as happens without consistent practice) the mind naturally wanders. If the purpose and intent of the meditation are not clear the mind wanders. If the method is not clear and followed precisely the mind wanders.</p>
<p>None of the worlds, astral or otherwise, are outside of your mind. Know this as projection, and deal with it as just another distraction. The ego's strategy is to keep trying to find dramatic scenarios to keep you engaged with thinking -- to keep the ego in the game. Expect unusual things to appear, but don't dally with them or regard any of them as special or significant. Waking up is the aim.</p>
<p>A couple of factors in returning to consistent practice: correct motivation, and integration with your routine.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Why do meditation? What is the right purpose of it? Meditation or any activity should align with your life direction. Life is short and precious; human life offers opportunities not available in other forms and realms. So if we are to avoid wasting life, what is its right direction?</p>
<p>If meditation or broader spiritual practice is only 'for me', it will engender the wrong relationship with practice and with the world. 'For me' attitude has what we call a <strong>'gaining idea'</strong>; that is you're in it to get something for yourself. So pure practice is not possible. The open-handedness, the letting-go, the moving beyond the illusion of selfhood that are foundational in practice are not possible with a gaining idea.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <strong>correct direction</strong> of life and practice is waking up out of the illusion of self, and using that to help all others. Even before complete awakening, helping others is already waking up out of self-cherishing. So the correct direction is 'for others'.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>if you grasp at results</strong>, there will always be disappointment and discouragement; thus, practice will always falter. Practice is completely momentary. The only real life is the moment. So only be sincere in the moment, and don't be concerned with what you get and when you get it.</p>
<p>You can definitely consider and clarify your life direction throughout your practice career. The very best way of building motivation -- and the way recommended by many masters -- is <strong>awareness of death</strong>. </p>
<p>Consider the <strong>very rare opportunity</strong> you have with a human birth -- the faculties of intelligence and compassion that are available to you, the access you have to good teaching and remarkable living examples of it, the leisure of spare time available for practice (not having to fight for food or shelter every moment of the day), and so on.</p>
<p>The human life is said to be the <strong>ideal balance of ease and difficulty</strong> for practice. So-called higher, more powerful forms of life have it so easy they rarely consider practice; they just rest in a sort of pleasant yoga-spa lifestyle until their good karma runs out; but when they fall, they often fall very far and very hard. Lower forms of life have so much struggle, fear, and upset that they can't even begin to stabilize their minds, much less carry on a consistent spiritual practice; many beings live in ongoing suffering.</p>
<p>But just thinking this is not very transformative. We have to take frequent, unflinching looks into our impermanence and the inevitability of death, to bring the issue home in the heart and overturn our deep habit of thinking of ourselves as immortal. Theoretically we know we will die, but we never live that way; we live as if we have all the time in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>death meditation</strong> is prescribed as the best support for motivation. One visualizes oneself aging, experiencing the breakdown of the body, dying (going through the process in detail), and being buried in the ground. The weaknesses present in the body right now (genetic or constitutional or environmental in origin) will likely continue and become more prominent with age. Any number of causes of death may reasonably arise: if you live in the country you may get hit by a truck on a country road, if you live in the city you may get killed by a mugger, and so on. Flu, cancer, or any of countless diseases may strike you down. So the meditation proceeds like this, bringing home the reality of death.</p>
<p>The meditator takes every opportunity to <strong>let the message sink in</strong>: friends and loved ones can't help, and must be left behind; favored situations and possessions can't help and must be left behind; social status, mental faculty, understanding, and feeling can't help and must be left behind.</p>
<p><strong>At the time of death, the only thing that can help you is the most deeply imprinted spiritual attainment</strong> -- the way compassion and clarity have taken a seat deep in your most subtle mind-stream. Knowing this to be true is the stable and real basis of motivation in practice. It is the start of unshakeable determination -- unshakeable, because it is based on truth rather than hope or desire or fantasy.</p>
<p>Recognizing that we're all in the same boat, this motivation becomes expressed as a practice for the sake of others: compassion for all suffering, dying beings.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Integration into daily activity</strong></p>
<p>Once proper direction and motivation have been generated, the issue is how to weave the practice into daily life. It is understood as a vital priority (that understanding, as spoken of above, is essential); but it won't necessarily automatically blossom into a regular practice. <strong>One's routines and habits have to be transformed.</strong></p>
<p>This is where a bit of clever thinking may help: where can the physical, mental, and vocal practices be woven into one's routines in a sustainable way?</p>
<p><strong>Identify the routines</strong>, especially the waking and evening routines, in which practice sessions can be introduced. What are the <strong>triggers</strong> that turn your attention in a certain direction? If you see your computer as soon as you wake up and it becomes a trigger for self-distraction, maybe you have to change the trigger: move the computer and create an altar or image of compassion, and put it where you will see it as the first thing.</p>
<p>If exercise or some other physical activity is a daily routine, identify the trigger for that routine and consider how physical practice like prostrations or yoga can make sense within the routine or replacing it.</p>
<p>Besides identifying the triggers that point your mind and activity in a certain direction, you will need to be clear on <em>what</em> you will be doing in the practice. That is, you may have a trigger that brings you to practice, but if you then waver about, uncertain about what to do, it won't help. You'll just be building a habit of wavering.</p>
<p>“I do/don't feel like it" should not have any influence. This is about devoting yourself to <strong>a consistent way of life</strong>, not about increasing your attachment to preference. Yes, when life takes a turn and you can't finish the practices you set out to do, you have to have compassion for yourself. But it should be clear that mood and preference have nothing to do with whether you do your practice.</p>
<p>Over time, a deeper sense of value should emerge, a contentment in following your life's purpose, which is to live a clear, awake life for the sake of all beings.</p>
<p>There are many <strong>supports for practice</strong>. Some are somewhat influential, and others are essential. The most significant and essential support is to find, spend time with, devote yourself to, and support a <strong>teacher</strong>. The spoken teaching, the guidance, the grounding influence, and the living example of a true teacher are irreplaceable.</p>
<p>It is very important to <strong>choose one path</strong> and method, and to <strong>learn it well</strong>. Just as wavering between like and dislike is an obstacle, wavering between various methods and overlapping teachings is an obstacle. You should know what you're doing, and then just do it. There are many good ways; choose one.</p>
<p><strong>Clean environment, clear schedule, balanced diet, healthy and regular sleep schedule, and balanced exercise</strong> are all important supports for your mind of practice. When the environment or the body begin to degenerate into sloppiness, the mind tends to slump into more animalistic habits as well. Clean, natural, and uplifting things can be touchstones for you, inside and outside of the body, calling you back to your higher path. But the emphasis should not tip too much toward externals: your <strong>inner practice and motivation</strong>, resting on the foundation of your acute awareness of death, should always be primary.</p>
