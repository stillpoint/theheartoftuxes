  <h1>Finding it impossible to meditate (beginner)</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>The only way i could make it further is if i heavily forced it, which i feel is pointless and gives the opposite effect of what meditation should give.</em></p>
<p>With all due respect, you don't know yet whether that is true. You are only aware of your opinion â€” your thought-reaction to the experience. You feel uncomfortable, but you don't know whether that uncomfortable experience is useless or useful.</p>
<p>The aim is <em>not</em> to always have our comfortable situation. The aim is to practice letting go of the mind that grasps at some things and pushes other things away. That is, we are training our ability to be <em>free</em> of "I want" and "I don't want".</p>
<p>You gain comfort by learning to be stable within any internal or external situation. If you only try to escape discomfort, your ability to adapt becomes weaker.</p>
<p>So there is value in sitting through ups and downs. One focuses on letting go of the mind and returning to the method of meditation. Your suffering arises because the stream of "I"-related thoughts is so far stronger than your will to let go of the grip and return to the method. And that is the core of suffering in your life! However much you are thrown around by your thinking in meditation, you are being thrown around by your thinking in your regular life; only it's happening <em>without your awareness and without your will and ability to release it</em>. So if you want to be free of that habitual suffering you need to do the hard thing and practice letting go of the stream of thought and returning to open presence.</p>
<p>When you become more engaged with the method of meditation you will experience the calmness and stability and ease that are aspects of your clear mind. Your clear mind is never lost; it's only covered up by mind habits. It's always there to be accessed. You just have to understand cause and effect: if you have spent many years (some say many lifetimes) building your habits and indulging in "I want" and "I don't want", it will take some patience to dissolve those habits.</p>
<p><strong>It's very important that you (A) are working with a good method and (B) understand it and follow it well. The method should be very clear to you.</strong> You should know how to arrange the body, and you should know what to do with the mind. If the method is not clear, you will not know what you should be doing with your effort; and when your mind gets loud and tumultuous you will have no recourse. When the method is clear, you will be better able to identify the times when you depart from it â€” the times when your mind takes you away â€” and you will know what you need to do at that point to help yourself return.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about method, message me back.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><em>Having said all that...</em> many people find their mind too active and out of control to even begin meditating correctly. In that case, you are right â€” just sitting through suffering without any transformation is pointless. There are very good alternatives. In these situations, a physical practice is very useful.</p>
<p><strong>A rhythmic, whole-body practice like bowing is very, very useful to bring the focus down out of your agitated mind and into a more stable place in your body.</strong> Other possibilities are running, swimming, Taiji, and â€” highly recommended â€” free dance. Bowing is the traditional meditative "emergency method" when someone is unable to sit. In addition, many traditions include bowing as part of the meditative practice (in addition to chanting, sitting, and walking meditations); the combination of practices work together to train the body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>If you try some vigorous whole-body-and-breath movement, I'm sure you'll experience its settling effect. The body gets tired (in a good way) and is ready to sit down; the breath invigorates and clears the mind. It's like going for a long hike and then naturally being very ready to sit down quietly at the lake: the energy has come down, and the mind's waves have settled just as the lakes ripples settle when the winds subside.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about bowing you can message me back or do a search.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the isolated issue of meditation, the larger issue of your behavior in life is important.</strong> If you put garbage into your body-and-mind throughout the day, a lot of garbage will be coming out in your meditation before you get to the clear stuff â€” you will be spending a lot of time just processing the day's garbage before you even get to the meditative mind behind it all.</p>
<p>So it's important to take care of the openings in your head: <strong>regulate what you take in through the eyes and ears</strong> (crude or stimulating/agitating images, other's opinions and gossip, entertainment, etc.); <strong>regulate what you take in through the mouth</strong> (the kind of food you eat); <strong>regulate what you put out through the mouth</strong> (your own speech); <strong>regulate what you follow and encourage in your mind</strong> (fantasy, anger, shame, judgment, confused thinking, etc.). Does your activity promote harmony with your environment and with other people â€” do you help others â€” or does your activity promote disengagement, disconnection, disharmony?</p>
<p>When your everyday life is reasonable and balanced, your mind will naturally be far more clear and balanced.</p>
