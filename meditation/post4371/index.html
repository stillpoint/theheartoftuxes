  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; If so, what's the real reason behind the method in the first place?</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. Maybe I talk too much. It comes clear with practice. Uncertainty is actually appropriate at the beginning stages. Keep going, don't be hard on yourself, and don't check your progress.</p>
<p>'Don't check' means don't try to figure out how well or poorly you're doing, and don't compare. More or less fun, more or less pleasurable, more or less clear â€” all of these will change. Just return to the method.</p>
<p>I didn't say there was no negative aspect to drifting, and I didn't say to be less strict. In a way, you are being <em>more</em> strict when you cut off the drama, because you are not going down side roads of thought. Instead of making the idea of a big struggle that you're either winning or losing, which means you're making thoughts and getting involved with them, you keep a mind of neutrality, equanimity.</p>
<p>Because you don't make stories and compare, you are left without that distraction. This may cause you to notice more thoughts. But noticing more thoughts is not a problem, as I've written before. It's <em>following</em> thoughts that is the problem. When you notice that thought has taken you away, you return to the method.</p>
<p>Yes, drifting into idle thought is no good. What's the motivation behind the method? That's a very good question! Very important!</p>
<p>So what is your motivation for trying meditation? Why be clear? Very good question. I'll just leave that with you for a while.</p>
<p>It's not that distraction is not negative. It's that you ought not to make a story and add emotional content. If you make thought the enemy, how will you integrate your thinking mind? How will you love yourself, and how will you love other thinking beings? How will you be okay when thoughts race?</p>
<p>Originally, there is no separation between you and thought and world and practice. Making stories in which you are either the hero or the victim keeps you in the illusion of separation: it's <em>you</em> against <em>something</em>. Meditation is not against anything. Everything is allowed to appear and disappear. No problem. Keep the mind that is no problem. But this no-problem mind doesn't move; it doesn't get baited and hooked by any thought.</p>
<p>Often thoughts will appear that seem very important. For example, many people get into tweaking their practice while they meditate. They think up ways to improve or feel better or achieve a different state. But this is all getting caught up in thinking. It <em>seems</em> important, but that is how the ego's attachment to thinking fools you and gets you to let go of your meditation. As long as you follow thinking, the ego will keep sending you thoughts that seem important so you will follow them.</p>
<p>When you let go, yes, you may notice more. Don't attach, don't get baited. Only return. Soon your mind will start to settle. You have to see it through, give it time. The mind will settle and your center will become stronger. Then even important-seeming thoughts will not have the power to move your. That means you will be free. All kinds of opinion, verbal attack, and attempts at manipulation will not have the power to move you. You will not be disturbed.</p>
<p>Return to the method with a tiger's tenacity. Just don't add emotional content and don't make your mind or anything that appears in it into your enemy. You know how a cat fixes its gaze on something it's hunting? You can even move its body, but its eyes will remain locked in concentration on that one point. This is even more true of a tiger. A tiger brings great concentration to its movement. So your practice can have that sharpness, not being distracted for even a split second. But when your attaching habit takes you away, there's no need to create more thoughts of frustration or self-blame or failure. A tiger has no self-blame or frustration; its concentration is pure.</p>
<p>Another way of illustrating this is in the way you let waves settle in water. If you're in a pool or pond that has choppy waves, you need to stop adding to the disturbance for the waves to settle. If you react to the waves and try to slap them down with force, you only add to the agitation. But let it be and the waves settle. Likewise, when mental waves appear there is no need to fight them. It doesn't mean that you are free to be lax and indulge in thinking; it means that you don't give anything the power to move you from your center.</p>
<p>One session is not a good indication. Wait until you've done some weeks or months of practice to see the overall difference. If you must analyze, do it calmly, immediately after your meditation. Logically look into what was effective and what was not, and what questions you would like to look into. Then let it go. Don't hold onto churning thoughts and undo the efforts of the practice session. Also, don't check during meditation. At meditation time, only follow the method.</p>
