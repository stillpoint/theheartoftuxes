  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>No, it's absolutely not enough.</p>
<p>There are other limbs, other requirements. <em>Samadhi</em> is only one part of the path. Wisdom and compassionate ethical activity are also required. The whole life must transform. You don't get this from a book.</p>
<p>But any start is a start. Actually it is not a start, because other things have already brought you to this point. You have found this practice in the midst of countless lifetimes of searching and losing. And there will be eons ahead of you.</p>
<p>Knowing that, what do you choose? What is easy on the outside is difficult on the inside. If you give up, that is the seed of future suffering. If you take up an indomitable, indefatigable, pure aspiration toward enlightenment, that is the seed of future enlightenment and the presence of momentary enlightenment.</p>
<p>Zen Master Dogen said,  <br />
&gt;Between aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana, there is not a moment's gap; continuous practice is the circle of the way.</p>
<p>Your intent, attitude, and commitment determine your result. And in a moment of pure aspiration, nirvana and enlightenment are already here. Past, present, and future interpenetrate; and life is clear. Each time, pick up the attitude of ceaseless practice. Each time, only attend to now.</p>
<p>Each time, only attend to now. And make this now continuous without stopping. It is not long. 'Long' means you are stuck in delusion, in discriminating mind, in the illusion of selfhood trapped in time and space. Real life is not long or short. What is facing you this moment? What is your correct relationship to it? That is all. Keep your correct relationship to the moment. And then just don't give it up for cheap, harmful substitutes.</p>
<p>As Zen Master Bankei would say, don't exchange your Unborn mind for thoughts. Thoughts make these delusions; attachment to thoughts makes you unenlightened. But it is because you trade in what you are originally, and believe in the things that pass through your head. You make "I", you make "I feel like...", you make "there", you make "getting there", you make "I won't get there", you make "long", and so on and so on. Originally, where are all these things? Originally they don't exist. You make them in your thinking mind.</p>
<p>But if you don't trade what you are originally for thoughts and stories, what you are originally is already enlightenment.</p>
<p>&gt;Among all you people here today there's not a single one who's an unenlightened being.  Everyone here is a buddha.  So listen carefully! What you all have from your parents innately is the Unborn Buddha Mind alone. There's nothing else you have innately.  This Buddha Mind you have from your parents innately is truly unborn and marvelously illuminating.  That  which is unborn is the Buddha Mind;  the Buddha Mind is unborn and marvelously illuminating, and, what's more, with this Unborn, everything is perfectly managed. The actual proof of this Unborn which perfectly manages [everything] is that, as you're all turned this way listening to me talk, if out back there's the cawing of crows, the chirping of sparrows or the rustling of the wind, even though you're not deliberately trying to hear each of these sounds, you recognize and distinguish each one.</p>
<p>You are just starting out, but you are putting your faith in your own figuring, checking, judging, assessing, surmising, comparing, analyzing, weighing, story-making, and so on. From the very beginning, you are trading in your <em>marvelously illuminating</em> Buddha mind for cheap, unsatisfactory thoughts. Bad trade!</p>
<p>If you don't trade your innate mind for thoughts, then the cawing of crows and the chirping of sparrows is already enlightenment. If you don't trade the Unborn mind for something born, then facing this screen and reading this communiqué is already enlightenment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't check your practice; only do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a proper teacher. You can start with <em>The Mind Illuminated</em>, but you can't interpret and carry it out on your own. It is the tradition of enlightened being to always, always seek out spiritual friends and benefactors — to seek them out with aspiration, with joy, with eagerness, with industriousness, with tirelessness, with devotion, with humility, with sincerity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a boundless aspiration, joyfully embracing eons of practice; but maintain your attention on the moment. "One moment is countless eons."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two hours is enough and not enough. Just this moment of practice is enough. But fulfilling the path takes your whole life, your whole being. It is not something you can compartmentalize. Life and practice become one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wise practitioner and a wise teacher recognize the student's condition and capacity, and adjust accordingly. An enormous yak takes on a yak's load. A large ox takes on an ox's load. A small donkey takes on a donkey's load. When you are a beginner, fulfill beginner's practice. When you are advanced, fulfill advanced practice. When you are a master, fulfill master's practice. Don't be so arrogant as to think everything should come to you easily. And by the same token, don't be so arrogant as to think you are not already Buddha.</p>
</li>
</ol>
