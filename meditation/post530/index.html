  <h1>Would you be embarrassed meditating publicly?</h1>

<p>That's great! I hope you attain much peace in your daily life too.</p>
<p><strong>The way to use a mantra correctly is to do it without a "getting" mind.</strong> Mantra can be a way to develop concentration and even trance, where you can get an experience of your perfectly still original nature. You can try this at home some time, or in a guided retreat. But that is not the <em>complete</em> use of mantra. The <em>complete</em> use is to attain that stillness (and peace), and to let that function in your day to day activities. Only attaching to peace and stillness is also a big problem!</p>
<p>So in daily life, you can keep a mantra going as <strong>something that anchors you to reality — to the present moment, however it may unfold</strong>. So for example, if you use the very popular mantra used by many Tibetans, <em>om mani padme hum</em>, then when you are happy <em>om mani padme hum</em> is happy and when you are sad <em>om mani padme hum</em> is sad. Also, peaceful <em>om mani padme hum</em>, busy <em>om mani padme hum</em>, bright <em>om mani padme hum</em>, dark <em>om mani padme hum</em>, washing dishes <em>om mani padme hum</em>, making love <em>om mani padme hum</em>, watching TV <em>om mani padme hum</em>... whatever the situation is, your practice merges with it.</p>
<p>This has an immediate, relative benefit and a long-term, absolute benefit:</p>
<p>First, <strong>returning to the mantra helps you return to reality</strong>. So you avoid countless problems that arise from checking, self-argument, fantasy, and the stories and dramas that appear through inner dialog. Since you keep returning to the present moment, you can actually respond to the way your life is moving — rather than just <em>thinking</em> about it. <strong>The present moment is the only moment where you can actually make a difference.</strong> Furthermore, the returning provides you with a measure of freedom and comfort since you can let go of the dramas and agitations and attachments that disturb you (either beating you down with negativity or roiling you up with pleasures that are essentially empty). You let go of the distractions and you return to <em>om mani padme hum</em> and just doing whatever needs to be done in the moment as you go through your day.</p>
<p>Over the long run, <strong>your mind will become more clear and free</strong>. You will develop a stronger center and be less susceptible to distraction and temptation; and when you do get distracted or indulge in things that don't help you, you will realize it more quickly and be able to return more cleanly. <strong>Eventually, <em>om mani padme hum</em> will completely merge with the moment</strong>; your mind and the universe will no longer have the mind-habit separating them, and you will attain your original and unconditional peace.</p>
<p>You can choose any mantra that you believe in. It's not necessary to think of the meaning of the mantra, and it's not necessary to believe that it has a special power. The necessary faith is the faith to be open-handed and let it all be. Just returning to the mantra and responding to the moment is enough. <strong>This is the faith: that you-and-the-moment are enough, as-is.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No need to try to get more quiet or try to understand something.</strong> That will happen naturally, like water making its own path down a hill. It is none of your business to try to make it happen.</p>
<p>So you can do mantra as a <strong>formal practice</strong> in addition to sitting meditation, and/or you can do mantra as a <strong>continuous grounding practice</strong> in your regular daily life.</p>
<p><strong>As a formal practice, set either an amount of time or a number of repetitions to practice each day.</strong> This can be done before or after your other meditation practice, or it can be done at a separate time, or it can also be your major meditation practice. The main thing is to do it <strong>without a gaining attitude</strong>; only do it, don't try to make your mind into anything in particular.</p>
<p>If you practice a set number of repetitions, you may want to use a string of beads to help you count. A bracelet or necklace of (traditionally) 27 or 108 beads — or really any known number — will do the counting for you. Each time you do one repetition of the mantra, move one bead. Once you have reached the end of the string or once you have returned to the big bead on a bracelet or necklace, you know that you've completed that number of repetitions. It's common to try anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 repetitions of a fast mantra per day. Longer, slower mantras may be done for fewer repetitions. But really, just doing it <em>once</em> sincerely is magnificent, and more helpful than you can know. A moment of meditation is never wasted.</p>
<p>If you want to practice mantra <strong>continuously throughout the day</strong>, that is a very wonderful practice. It is similar to mindfulness practice in that you remain functional; you can still take care of your work and relationships and enjoyment, you can still do the laundry and cross the street without having to drop your practice. At first, it will take effort to keep returning to the mantra and remembering it. The extra mental effort needed may make it a bit awkward, and other people may notice that you seem "distracted" even though you're actually returning to the present moment more often. You may even be absent-minded and, say, forget your keys because you're trying to keep the mantra. That will work itself out soon enough.</p>
<p>Later, the mantra will become easy and automatic. It will again become easier to go about your daily business. The risk here is that you may actually develop the ability to do the mantra in a robotic, background way <em>while</em> you are distracted. There will still be a part of your mind that remains in contact with the present moment, but your mind will be divided and will continue its distracting, checking, attaching habit. At this stage, you have to use your will to keep returning to the present and keep giving energy to the mantra practice.</p>
<p>At some point you may experience gaps in thinking where great peace and stillness arise. That is neither good nor bad. If you sense that it is very significant, you should seek out a teacher. In any case, you should continue your mantra practice as usual and not be distracted. <strong>The ego fears the uncertainty and surrender that happen when you approach your original nature</strong>, so it creates all kinds of tricky strategies to stop you from proceeding in the direction of open unknowing. The ego will produce all kinds of interesting theories, seemingly dangerous or horrible outcomes, tantalizingly pleasurable emotions and mind states, and seemingly all-important realizations — all to get you to stop letting go and being present. <strong>So never mind, just keep doing your practice.</strong></p>
<p>Good?</p>
