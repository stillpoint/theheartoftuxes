  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The 'why' and the 'how' are both very important.</p>
<p>The <strong>'why'</strong> comes first. If you have a correct, positive <strong>motivation</strong>, and if your motivation is clear to you, then already you have solid footing for practice even in difficulty.</p>
<p>Practicing only to get a good feeling for yourself produces a situation where practice goes as you go: if you're 'up', no problem; if you're 'down', practice stops. But then again, if you're up soon you don't feel the need to do meditation, since you're feeling fine so why bother? And only when you've been down enough to be shaken out of complacency do you realize the need to get some peace of mind, but by that time you haven't developed stability through consistent practice, and meditating without stability while in a difficult situation is a recipe for disappointment.</p>
<p>But if your motivation includes the broader picture of the meaning of life and death, and if it embraces not only your own small circle but the wider circle of others, there is a force that can withstand your own ups and downs. Waking up from the dream of life and helping all others to be free of suffering is a deeper motivation. Like the depth of the ocean, it is not disturbed by surface waves.</p>
<p>So that is the 'why' that provides the basis not only for meditation but for anything you do in life.</p>
<p>The <strong>'how'</strong> is also important. It's amazing how many people expect to succeed in a practice without actually knowing the steps and the aim. Vagueness and doubt won't do, because — as you've found — you need to know very clearly what to do with your mind at any moment; and when stress arises this becomes even more crucial.</p>
<p>So the first thing to do is to <strong>learn properly</strong>, from a capable, trustworthy (and ideally traditional) source. Each step provides the basis for the next step; and each step is built on the foundation of previous steps. When the basis is correct, the next step can be correct.</p>
<p>What meditation do you practice? Where did you learn it? Clarifying your motivation and learning the method properly will go a long way toward steadying your mind during times of stress. These foundations will allow you to use your rationality to overcome your habit and emotional reaction: although you feel the urge to avoid the stressful feelings, if you understand how meditation works you can understand what you need to do, and have confidence that the feelings can't control or hurt you.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>consistency</strong> is important. You have to practice at times when you are at ease, to build your ability to face difficulty when it comes. Trying to ward off stress once it's taken over is too late (unless you've gained some degree of ability).</p>
<p>There is the outer factor of stress — that causes within life situations that can trigger upset — and there is the inner factor of stress, which is your own reaction and thought. <strong>Meditation works on the inner factor. Direct action is required for the outer factor.</strong> Upsetting relationships require good communication or clear boundaries. Poor health requires regulation of sleeping, eating, and physical activity. Mental agitation requires regulation of media consumption (taking in peaceful and noble images and messages, and avoiding violent, lustful, or trivial images and messages). And so on....</p>
<p><strong>Concentration style meditation</strong> trains you in letting go of triggered thoughts. You let go of all thoughts and distractions, and return to a single object of concentration. The letting go of distraction is called concentration. There are many possible objects and many traditional methods. You can choose one, learn it from a worthy source, and train with it.</p>
<p>But many people find that they become too disturbed to even sit down and begin letting go. It is quite common, and is becoming more common in contemporary life, with online culture that promotes disconnection from body, family, place, and embodied social interaction. In these cases, <strong>physical practice</strong> has proved to be extremely valuable. Even if you can't sit down and face your agitated mind, you can still do vigorous prostrations, or yogic Sun Salutations, or Taiji, or rhythmic exercise like rowing, swimming, running, or free dance, or rhythmic work practice like garden work or chopping wood, etc.</p>
<p>Next besides physical practice is <strong>devotional practice</strong>, especially suited for those who tend to be heart-centered and faithful. (Prostration practice can be employed as both physical and devotional meditation.) Making repeated water offerings or doing other altar practice is found by many people to be very calming, and it also can have very positive effect on one's heart, on one's connection to spirit, and on one's <em>motivation</em>, thus creating a very good basis for other meditative practices in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to consider that such sensitive reactivity to stress may fall into the category of mental or emotional illness that should be addressed <strong>with the help of an expert</strong>. Sometimes an emotional wound, a mental pattern, or a biochemical imbalance is very easily turned around with the right help. And sometimes, even with the right help it can take quite a while before one sees the light at the end of the tunnel (in which case, going it alone could be very difficult indeed).</p>
<p>There is not only one stock answer to your question. Apply the right medicine for the situation.</p>
