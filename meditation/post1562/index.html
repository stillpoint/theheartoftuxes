  <h1>How do I change my desires? Seriously it's been 2 months and nothing is improving I'm trying hard but srsly come on</h1>

<p>What is your practice? Unclear practice has unclear result. I don't know from this little bit you've shared, but it may be that <strong>a more clear understanding</strong> of the cause-and-effect in your life would help. That could mean anything from studying meditation more deeply to receiving counseling or psychotherapeutic support.</p>
<p>To start, just clearing out is very difficult. Nature abhors a vacuum; <strong>something has to enter</strong> in the place of what you clear away. What goodness do you want to invite into the space you clear?</p>
<p>Next, <strong>you can't do it by your own efforts</strong>. It is done through another force, a force or source greater than you. Giving yourself over to that force or source is key. "Okay, I will try my best, but I leave it up to You to accomplish it." Whether this is conceived of as Buddha, God, Tao, Cosmic Intelligence, or your Original Self doesn't matter. What matters is relieving yourself of the (illusory) burden of making it all happen. In a moment, put it all down, everything.</p>
<p>Third, you have made some changes in the past 2 months; but you have had at least 7 years of habit-making, and 25 years of attachment-making, and your effort in these practices (habit and attachment) has been very consistent indeed, happening many times every day. So just <strong>compare the length, intensity, and consistency of practices</strong> to see that your results have actually been quite good with the little you've done.</p>
<p>Fourth, all of the influences you mention are mind-altering influences (yes, living at home with no responsibilities is also mind-altering). Therefore you are not the best one to judge whether your efforts are paying off. Your organism has been used to alteration, to unnatural states. As it approaches natural states it sees <em>them</em> as unnatural; but from the higher view that is not the case. So it would be helpful to <strong>connect with stable, grounding, and wise (high-view) helpers</strong> — spiritual friends and mentors who can help you return to the clear view when you are still unclear.</p>
<p>I notice that you talk about <em>having</em> to wake up, workout, study, live up to responsibilities. Is that the case? This is the mindset of having things imposed upon you — of being a visitor in your own life and being dictated to; but there is also available to you <strong>the mindset of being the host in your own life</strong>, choosing to embrace what comes your way, and choosing which way to go.</p>
<p>Being the host in your own life is a practice; it is something that you can develop and get better at. At its simplest and most essential, it is a practice of letting go of internal judgment and all the chatter that goes with it, and returning to open presence. That is, <strong>engage with what's in front of your nose</strong> rather than commenting on all the rest of your life that's not actually happening right now.</p>
<p>"I have to do this, and this, and this..." Yes, everyone has that. Even animals have to find their food and shelter and their path in life. But thinking about all these things in the past and future for the most part doesn't help you. Right now you are not having to do anything; right now, you are just reading this. This is where your true life is. And in this moment, you can choose to continue, or to move on, or take any of countless actions. So in the moment you experience your true life and you are free. If you continue in this momentary practice your organism will naturally become more clean and clear, and your way will unfold in front of you. I don't think I've ever met anyone who was able to 'figure it all out'.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that <strong>suffering comes from 'I'-thinking</strong>. The more 'I, my, me' you have, the more suffering you have. Overturning your big life suffering doesn't just mean making things better for I-my-me. You get rid of one habit, another self-centered impulse appears. You can temporarily go beyond certain specific behaviors by yourself, but going beyond the self-obsession behind them all is what leads to lasting happiness and freedom. And there is nothing better for overcoming self-obsession than its direct cure: <strong>compassion</strong>, care for others. If you begin to actively care for others, your happiness will increase. Whether you give physical gifts, offer help, share warmth and good feelings, or just keep kind and generous thoughts for others; and whether you offer this care to humans or animals, the living or the dead, compassion will melt (at first) many and then (eventually) all of your problems. Whenever you find your mind turning toward suffering thoughts about yourself and your own life, you can know "Oh, I have too much 'I'. Time to offer something to another being."</p>
