  <h1>meditate with kids?</h1>

<p>Integral teaching comes from the center, and moves out from there. It is the tradition of great teachers that they themselves do the practice they are conveying to others.</p>
<p>I recommend that you first give yourself at least a few minutes at a time to do your practice, independent of any roles (like 'parent' or 'teacher'). It will benefit you as well as your family. The most important part of conveying a practice is that you yourself embody it. That will sink in more deeply than any speech or contrived activity.</p>
<p>When questions arise, it is good to talk about what it means <em>to you</em> rather than trying to be an authoritative teacher. That means you need to have your own private experience and connection with practice, to be able to talk about it sincerely.</p>
<p>If you regularly go to sit quietly, there may come a time when your children want to find out what that's about, or even may want to join you. If they jump on you or otherwise interrupt while you're sitting you might invite them to do something in particular with you (rather than either letting them interrupt completely or rejecting their presence). For example, you might ask if they want to do three bows with you: from standing, kneel, touch the head and hands to the floor... take a moment to breathe... then stand up... take a moment to breathe... repeat. Mindful walking is another possibility: taking a step, resting, taking another step, resting... maybe for ten steps or so. They may join you for only part of it and then be ready to continue onto their own next thing, but you will have welcomed them to experience practice on their own terms. If your partner is interested in meditation, you can each encourage your kids to offer the gift of peacefulness or quiet during times when one of you is taking a few minutes of meditation, letting them know that peace, quiet, space, attentiveness are things that can be offered to someone else.</p>
<p>If a child expresses an interest in actually sitting quietly with you, it could be helpful for them to have something very clear to do with their mind rather than just 'sit and be quiet'. Some people can just be quiet right off the bat, but not many. So you might say they can notice how breath appears in their belly, or they can count breaths up to 25, or say they can try to listen to everything. Some people connect very well to prayer, so thinking of people, animals, and places in your life you can offer good wishes and hold feelings of love for them for a minute or two at a time. You can let the kids know they can get up and leave if they want, but you can also ask how long they want to try for — to see if they can count breaths for a whole minute, for example.</p>
<p>Later, you might have an activity that helps them digest their experience, like drawing a picture of how they felt, or taking a body shape or movement of what happened for them. Also, they can make a picture or shape of how they experience <em>you</em> when you're having a minute of peace. Bowing to each other in gratitude is also a lovely and simple practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can introduce meditative moments into the natural course of the day. Taking a moment of silence before a meal, for instance. Pausing on a walk to just listen. Lighting a candle in the evening, to represent a minute of peace.</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh offered the idea of having a family 'mindfulness bell' that any member of the family can ring to remind everyone to have a mindful moment. This can be useful, for instance, during interactions that start to move into heated arguments: the bell is rung, and everyone can take a few conscious breaths and remember the value of peace. (Thich Nhat Hanh's writings may hold other suggestions for the family.)</p>
<p>Sometimes the accessories of spiritual practice can become a doorway, as the objects hold some kind of fascination. The objects themselves have a sort of iconic, archetypal presence; and they can draw a child's attention. So bringing out a mala and showing how to be 'just now' with each bead could be a way in. Ringing a bell and listening to the sound. Using a wooden clapper or a wooden instrument (in Asian temples: <em>moktak</em> or <em>mokugyo</em>) to accompany a minute of chanting. Lighting incense and bowing to an image or idea of 'peaceful mind' or 'waking up'. Creating an altar and changing fresh water every morning, or arranging a new offering from nature at some point in the day (a pebble and dandelion flower... a feather... a clump of soil...).</p>
<p>Even in regular activities like play or eating ice cream or sitting down to do homework, a moment of peace can be introduced, or a moment of listening, or of feeling 'I am here'. Then when you yourself go to sit in meditation, you can tell them that you want to practice 'I am here' (or peace, or listening) for a bit longer.</p>
<p>It's good to return to a theme; so whether it's 'I am here' or whether it's 'let's listen to our inside and our outside', revisiting that phrase and intention regularly will be helpful. If you do it enough, the kids will understand that sometimes you're doing it even without saying so.</p>
<p>Whole body-and-being movement is especially wonderful and important and influential for children — for anyone, really, but especially for kids, to encourage and not to quash their natural embodiment. Dancing, play-acting, mimicking things in nature, playing 'guess what I am': there are many activities that can encourage embodiment; and along the way you can include the idea that movement has many qualities — the quiet as well as the boisterous. Whatever kind of movement you're doing together, you can sometimes practice slowing down and paying attention. Children are very often 'up' in energy, very active and not so grounded; so the key is to allow this slowing down to be an interesting exploration, but not to force or expect them to stay there. In fact, if you encourage a hyper child to dance out their mood fully they may come out the other end of it, tired and ready to settle. You can go back and forth between moods and energies, but the general idea is that the range is broad; activity and embodiment don't only have to be one way.</p>
