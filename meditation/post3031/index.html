  <h1>Thoughts on current meditation practice & technique for newbie? Too intense?</h1>

<p>Thank you for your beautiful message. This is an important clarification.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>When I dropped everything in my life, it was with the notion that it would be painful doing so and I would work on my social anxiety and meet new people and new positivity in my life.</em></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I also do have hobbies and a lifestyle.... I workout, exercise, I read, I meditate, etc. Things are exactly at the place they need to be for me, but it's not like I gave everything up... I just want to meet some cool friends and meet some cool girls now, and learn to change my relationship I have with my thoughts.</em></p>
<p>This willingness to engage is what I'm talking about. It does sound like you're on the right track.</p>
<p>So why make a point of saying how drastic and huge your cutting-off of others was? That was a bit of an overblown story. That's the kind of exaggerated thinking to be released.</p>
<p>My advice still stands; it is important advice for many reading this thread; it just may not apply as much to you now that you explain your lifestyle and intention. Actually, it still applies to you somewhat. Don't expect meditation to do everything!</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The new instruction you are getting is not good, not bad. But every instruction and every method has cause and effect. What is the purpose and the effect of that pattern of breathing and of bringing the attention to the forehead? It is an intentionally forceful way of directing energy. This is okay if the whole context of meditation is very clear â€” why you do meditation, why you choose this particular one, how it fits into your life, how it is meant to change you, what the signs of attainment are, what the signs of error are, what you can do when energy goes awry, how your environment and eating/sleeping/activity schedules support balanced energy, and <em>who is responsible</em> for all the various manifestations of energy that may appear. As I said above, this kind of practice is best performed under the responsible leadership of a teacher. You have to know the method and why the method is used. And someone has to be responsible for settling flare-ups, guiding erratic energy back, soothing physical responses, checking behavioral changes. All of these are more critical in energy practice. If you trust your friend implicitly and feel he is qualified and committed to seeing the guidance through to the end, fine; no problem. But you are responsible for researching whatever method you adopt, and for creating those healthy boundaries just as you have done in your relationships.</p>
<p>Placing attention in the forehead is, first of all, choosing a place for energy to be directed. Rather than the openhandedness of pure meditation, one takes the decision to direct energy to a specific spot for a specific reason. So one had better be quite sure that the spot and the reason are appropriate, are ideal.</p>
<p>In pure meditation, you don't manipulate or contrive anything. This is a clear path. The method you describe is different. Third eye meditation has been used successfully by may people to get awakening; but it also is associated with a larger proportion of people who receive erratic mental experiences like dreams and visions, or energetic experiences like buzzing anxiety or very pleasant feelings, life disruptions, and physical issues like headaches and dizziness (or in extreme cases searing heat and pain), and it is especially associated with a larger proportion of people who <em>attach</em> to the manifestations and get sidetracked, mistaking the <em>effects</em> for the <em>path</em>. So this is why a very clear context is recommended, where the intent of developing wisdom and compassion is very clear and strong, so that one is not sidetracked by the sensual temptation of energy or the ego-feeding sense of power it engenders. And it is also why the supports of a committed teacher and practice and lifestyle structures should be in place, to keep the energy regulated and to keep the student on track with a balanced life. Thus, this kind of meditation is traditionally presented in a holistic setting of physical training, dietary and lifestyle recommendations, distinct breathing and meditation practices, and ongoing supervision.</p>
<p>As to bringing attention specifically to the forehead, it tends to raise and brighten the energy. This is traditionally recommended, in both Hindu and Taoist yogas, for people middle-aged and older. In younger people, especially young men, it is said to put the practitioner at risk of too much rising energy. Young people already tend to have fiery and erratic energy, so this can unbalance it. It's not to say that it can't be done; it's just a caution, and calls for perhaps even more emphasis on a balanced context of life structures and teaching. Young people involved in energy meditation are more frequently given the lower belly as a first area of focus, as it is more settling and normalizing. (The 'lower dantien', as opposed to the 'upper dantien'.) The heart area is sometimes also assigned; but this tends to stimulate the emotions whereas the head area tends to stimulate the thought and visualization energy.</p>
<p>You can choose. Perhaps it so very fortunate to have an experienced friend that it's worth it to you to try the path that he has chosen. But you should do it with your eyes open, having researched the method and path, and the reasons they are offered in their particular form, and having determined if your friend is able to be responsible for your path.</p>
<p>You mention "turning your mind off" more than once. This is not correct meditation. It is not the right approach. It was another indicator of an isolationist attitude.</p>
<p>Trying to turn your mind off initiates an internal battle, and of course it will be exhausting over long periods. The true aim is not to eradicate thought but to cut it off. This is a subtle difference to understand, but it is an important distinction. You cut off your <em>attachment</em>, your <em>engagement</em> with thought. You don't try to control or destroy the thoughts themselves. If you try to do away with thinking, you are doing away with one of your most precious faculties and disowning an integral part of yourself. So this is another instance where the openhanded, non-gaining attitude comes into play. You let it be. You don't try to form or control manifestation; rather, you practice being unmoved by it. Resting in your center, you allow all things to appear and pass away on their own, without grasping.</p>
<p>This is why correct motivation is so important in energy work. Because you are choosing to lead the energy somewhere in particular rather than saying "okay, okay, you go wherever it's best for you to go", it becomes more likely that a controlling, manipulative, egoistic attitude takes over in the practice. Practice must not be dualistic. If you ever find yourself in contention with a part of your being, take that as an alarm bell or warning flag, and remember the true intent of meditation.</p>
<p>I've written a lot on posture. You can search my posting history for helpful advice. Please don't force yourself to sit through hip pain. If an hour-long session is too long, it's better at first to sit for a shorter time than to repeatedly feel overwhelmed and defeated. You and your friend are not the same; you aren't working with the same situation. Hopefully the teaching will adapt well to your situation.</p>
<p>I do agree that â€” sooner rather than later â€” it is good to let go of guided meditation and stand on your own two feet, so to speak. You have to judge whether you're ready for that.</p>
<p>The basis of all your decisions in practice is formed by the motivation. <em>Why</em> do meditation? You say it's for social anxiety. Is that all? If that is the overriding aim, then meditation may not even be the best way for you. Life coaching, counseling, private or group psychotherapies, or healing group activities (I always recommend free dance) could be much more effective toward this singular aim.</p>
<p>Best wishes!</p>
