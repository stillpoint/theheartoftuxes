  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>First, let's be mindful of language, because what we do with our speech influences how we think and act and experience life.</p>
<p>"Nothing but..." is not true. This is a story you make about your experience, a way to aggrandize your ego in the midst of difficulty. Because it is more terrifying to the ego to let go and dissolve than to experience horrible pain.</p>
<p>Essentially, stating things in this way is 'receiving the second arrow'. When someone asked the Buddha whether he experiences pain like all us regular humans do, he replied that, yes, he experiences pain, but he doesn't receive the 'second arrow'. The first arrow is the plain fact of experience. The second arrow is making the thoughts "Oh, how terrible! How awful that I am experiencing this! Poor me!"</p>
<p>When we make the story about 'poor me' we are solidifying our self-image. We take on the role of the victim, or the noble suffering student, or any of a number of ego characters. Often it happens as a way of feeling righteous or strong when faced with our vulnerability. Rather than experiencing the truth of vulnerability, we devise a scenario where we 'would have won, if not for cruel fate'. Thinking that life is against us relieves us of responsibility for our own state â€” at least, in our thinking it does.</p>
<p>So being meticulous about language has deep implications for our integrity. When we take care to speak only the truth, our responsibility emerges. Your experience is not <em>only</em> intense heartbreak and anger. There are many other things going on. Plain perception of sense-objects, for instance: the world doesn't disappear; you can still see your hands in front of your eyes if you look. Also, the experience of <em>lack</em> of pain is present. You just don't acknowledge it. But if you were to scan your body, you would find many places where there is no pain, and perhaps not much sensation at all. This could be conceived of as a neutral or even peaceful experience, happening at the same time as the sadness and anger.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also the experience of pleasure happening. If you were to look carefully, you would no doubt find it, somewhere in your body or your mind or in the environment â€” some pleasant or comfortable or delightful aspect of experience.</p>
<p>So then the responsibility that emerges is what to do with your attention.</p>
<p>If the attention is not well trained, certain objects will indeed overwhelm it; and if there is an underlying pattern of suppression this may happen quite readily.</p>
<p>It may be that still, sitting meditations are not for you right now. They may bring you in too close a contact with your thinking, and/or they may open doors of feeling that have a big backlog behind them. A few options are possible: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Continue</strong>. It is true that if you continue, things will change. The question is whether the time, effort, difficulty, and repercussions will be in your best interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change the method</strong>. For instance, you might do better with a mantra method. More thinking &gt; faster mantra. Calming &gt; slower mantra. Joyful feeling &gt; buoyant mantra. Sad feeling &gt; releasing mantra. Angry feeling &gt; penetrating mantra. The mantra can adjust to your mood and pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do it in a supportive context</strong>. This can mean creating your own supportive rituals to define the safe and permissive practice space and attitude. The rituals also have the effect of grounding you in plain reality (for example, as you attend mindfully to altar objects, chanting, etcetera.) <em>Supportive context</em> may also mean changing your environment, practicing with others, practicing in a designated place like a temple, and especially practicing with a teacher and/or guide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A capable meditation teacher or awakened master has a grounding effect on the emotions, and can give helpful teachings and point out pitfalls.</p>
<p>A therapist or facilitator can help you go through difficult or vulnerable inner territory with awareness and compassion, and likewise can give guidance that you would not think of on your own. For healing, we generally need to relive the original traumas, but from a new perspective â€” from compassion and open, non-attached awareness. The therapist and therapeutic setting are very important supports in this process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let go of sitting meditation altogether and look into other options</strong>. Physical practice, in particular, is recommended in cases of emotional upheaval, for several reasons: It is inherently grounding, as it relaxes the body, harmonizes the breath, and brings the pent-up energy down out of the head and heart, and into its proper home. It also offers pathways of presence that don't skirt so closely to the thinking mind and the emotional patterns generated by it. Prostration practice is highly recommended for quickly bringing the energy down to the center. Other movement practices like various Yogas, Taiji, Qigong, and others can be very fruitful for locked patterns of physical/mental/emotional tension. Even sports like swimming, kung fu, free dance, cycling, and others are found by many to be therapeutic.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be ideal combinations of the above options. For example, you may take on the supportive contexts of therapy, as well as joining a practice group, and your practice of choice may be physical practice rather than sitting meditation.</p>
<p>Psychological material is suppressed through tension and holding. We avoid experiencing the flow of thought and emotion by stopping flow in ourselves. Parts of the body get locked up, and the associated flowing energies get shut off or shunted into set patterns. When we begin to let go in meditation, those locked parts begin to release. It is correct; it is healing; but if we don't recognize it as correct and healing we can build up more patterns around the release â€” we may avoid it, fight it, make stories about it, become inundated by it and unable to function.</p>
<p>At some point you are going to have to let all things arise freely. At some point you are going to have to be utterly vulnerable. These times should ideally be made safe.</p>
<p>Therefore <em>appropriate</em> release is necessary. You need to find the right time, place, and level of release for your best health. This is for you to discuss with your guides and allies. Meditation is not a cure-all; it is a tool to be used in the proper context. Just as you would use a hammer and saw for different applications, or as you would use different medicines for different patients and different illnesses, so should the right meditation be used in the right way for your situation. Sometimes that means no meditation for a while.</p>
