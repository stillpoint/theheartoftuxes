  <h1>Changing postures and staying awake?</h1>

<p>Practitioners tend not to know what they're capable of, nor what is best practice; they only understand according to their past 'knowledge' based on conditioning, habit, and preference. On the other hand, practice won't go well if you don't take care of yourself or if you try to impose your opinion upon your situation.</p>
<p>I've been sick with a cold many times in retreat. It's common. The virus tends to get passed around, so it's only a matter of time before almost everyone gets sick at some retreats. Although it's uncomfortable and more difficult, it's very possible to sit upright and perform all the practices with this kind of illness. Prostrations, chanting, sitting, walking, eating, and working meditations are all possible. Then you have a chance to learn that 'sick' doesn't exist outside of your thinking; and by extension, no situation need have the power to shut you down or keep you from being present and free.</p>
<p>I've also been sick with flu and fever. At these times in retreat I've had to take some time off practice. It can be more uncomfortable to be away from practice, though, especially when you hear everyone else going through the schedule. I mean, you're lying in bed and hearing all of the bells and wood clackers that signal changes in practice periods, interview, etc.; and you can feel very bad for being separate. Something in you may be more comfortable returning to practice and sitting.</p>
<p>I've also had a severe back injury in (month long) retreat. Aside from two sittings during which I tried to lie down (and became extremely drowsy, nodding off), I spent the rest of the retreat in sitting posture, albeit extremely painfully. It was one of the hardest things I'd ever done, but also one of the best, as my mind became utterly momentary â€” I couldn't bear more than a split-second of the pain, so I had to narrow my attention to just the moment, with corresponding results.</p>
<p>As I wrote in the post I linked to, yes, sometimes it's necessary to change your posture or support, to avoid injuring yourself further or to make meditation possible at all. But unless you have quite a bit of motivation and experience in ongoing all-day practice, you might not believe in your capacity or conceive of how much more effort is possible.</p>
<p>Practicing on your own has many inherent difficulties. It's a bit more of a balancing act: keeping your interest and motivation stoked becomes a bigger issue since you don't have all the external supports of a group or residential practice. So sometimes it may be better not to push too much and risk developing an inner resentment or resistance, but focus on maintaining a thread of consistency. So for instance, if your regular sitting is too unpleasant you might make a modification that keeps it enjoyable, keeps you engaged and eager for more. Shorter consistent sittings are better than sporadic longer sittings, for this reason.</p>
<p>A mala can be a great support when you're ill. I mean, you have all this precious time on your hands, lying around when otherwise you'd be occupied with any number of things. It's the perfect practice situations in many aspects, since you have time and solitude and freedom from distraction. You can work your mala in bed. Even with great exhaustion or terrible headache when you are forced to close your eyes, a mala can help you maintain contact with the present moment. You work the beads with your fingers, and return to simplicity and presence: just <em>this</em> bead... <em>this</em> bead... <em>this</em> bead....</p>
<p>When you are more alert you can do mantra practice along with working the mala, or whatever practice you usually do (breathing-based practices and self-inquiry can also be done with a mala). You can sit up in bed for a time and do regular practice. Then when it's time to rest you can keep working the mala. It helps maintain a thread of presence. If you keep simple moment-to-moment mind you could turn out clearer in your illness than you are during your usual practice!</p>
<p>A mala can also help you maintain a thread of presence when you're taking in entertainment. Instead of the marathon TV watching or online surfing that are often the refuge of the ailing, the entertainment can be there but the mind can maintain a bit of noble detachment by staying in touch with the mala. It can help you turn off the devices and get proper rest when you've consumed your fill.</p>
<p>There are also 'meditations' aimed specifically at healing. Breath and energy practices fall in this category. There are also visualizations that enhance the immune response and harness the bodymind's resources toward healing. The Medicine Buddha practices in Tibetan Buddhism are also directed at healing, as are Tonglen and Metta practices. So you can make use of your 'down' time to help yourself in any of these ways. Your concentration will still be trained; your presence will still be practiced; the intent is just directed more specifically.</p>
