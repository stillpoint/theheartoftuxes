  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Our habit as humans, and especially as modern Westerners, is to think everything to death rather than get in there and <em>do</em> it. And for many of us this is a particularly deep habit: we overthink; we try to know every possible scenario before we meet it, and so we are very late to the party! It takes us a long time to get around to actually trying the thing, actually getting the life experience that can only be got by <em>doing</em>.</p>
<p>The ego seeks control. It wants to know that it can control the meditative experience; and so it is the ego that is fearful, and it is the ego that is desperate to get more and more data about what could possibly go wrong and how to handle every eventuality. This reveals a profound lack of trust in our basic resources. It reveals a profound lack of faith in our basic okayness.</p>
<p>Please let go of the desperate grasping of the ego, and just have a simple moment in meditation. You don't need much. You don't need anything, really. You just need to have a simple moment.</p>
<p><strong>"Zen mind is everyday mind."</strong> You don't need to know the ten thousand ways something could go wrong. Just take the first step on your journey. If the first step turns out fine, take the next. If a problem comes up, deal with it then.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>no hard and fast rules</em></p>
<p>That's a gross generalization based on the aim of encouraging new meditators and helping them relax. It is certainly not true across the board or as an all-inclusive statement. And the higher your aim and aspiration, the less true that becomes.</p>
<p>There are many possible mistakes, many possible pitfalls. In fact, we <em>start</em> from a mistaken position! That is why we meditate in the first place. If there were really no rules and nothing to possibly do wrong, we wouldn't need meditation, would we? Our usual state and even any horrific mental or physical act would be fine.</p>
<p>At a shallow level — or let's say, at a <em>beginner's</em> level — just actually sitting down and being relatively still can be a tremendous achievement. A lot of fear, trepidation, and conceptualized crap may have to be overcome before someone even begins to see the value of meditation and try settling down and relaxing. So at this stage, relaxation is particularly influential. Just doing <em>some kind</em> of meditation repeatedly is particularly influential. And being encouraged to let go of the thousand doubtful and judgmental thoughts that could arise is particularly influential. It's because of the tender, tenuous stage one is in. So all of this gets encapsulated in the somewhat unskillful phrase "there's no wrong way to do it".</p>
<p>Perhaps more apt would be the statement that "there's no bad <em>situation</em> for meditation": you can apply your attention regardless of the circumstances; and in that way, the ups and downs of life control you less and less. But there are definitely correct and incorrect ways to use your mind. And, either in support of the clear, stable, peaceful mind or in opposition to it, there are helpful and unhelpful ways to arrange the body, to go through the sequence of activities, to maintain the attitude, to generate the motivation... and at increasingly deep or refined levels of practice, to regulate one's environment, lifestyle, relationships, and even the smallest positive or negative actions in daily life. These can definitely be 'correct' or 'incorrect' in how they support or destroy clarity, peace, compassion, and other aims of meditation.</p>
<p>At the beginning it is very important to learn one good, proven, traditional method, and to follow it meticulously. If the method is effective and if it is followed faithfully, it will certainly bear fruit. If the method is insufficient, or if it is sufficient but not for the aim one is hoping for, or if it is both sufficient and appropriate for one's aim but is not followed well, then the absolute certainty of cause-and-effect means that the results will not be ideal, or maybe even positive at all.</p>
<p>So this is the focus at the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understand your correct aim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a proven method that can lead to that aim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn the method from a good source</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn the method well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the method by trying it repeatedly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you try to learn and avoid all the possible pitfalls you will be so caught up looking for pitfalls that you will not be attending to the practice.</strong> This is not the way. Let go of the controlling mindset that is in fear of making any mistake. Just go forward confidently and enjoy the journey. When a mistake arises, as it will for everyone, quickly correct it. That is all.</p>
<p>Along the way you will learn the pitfalls and how to deal with them. That is what the teacher is for. That is what the clear method is for. That is what the practice group is for. That is what relationship with experienced meditators is for. All of these help you digest your mistakes and make them into wisdom. But you digest them gradually, as you do with food. If you try to eat the entire refrigerator in one meal you will have a big, big problem; and if you try to digest every possible mistake from one Reddit post you will have a big, big problem. Go slow, go gradually, and enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>At the start, your sittings should be short enough to be pleasant. This establishes in you the association between meditation and an pleasantness, ease, joy, etc. If you push too hard and try to finish the journey at once, you take on more than you are capable of handling; it becomes unpleasant, and you begin to associate meditation with bad feeling, struggle, and failure. The mind resents being pushed around, and it will rebel. The unprepared body is not ready for long sittings, and it will respond with pain and injury. So while it is very good to have completely high-reaching aspiration, it is also very important to have your feet firmly rooted in reality, to realize your capacity at each stage, and to harmonize with it: when you have developed some experiential faith in the goodness of meditation, and when you have had some consistent experience with how your mind works, then you can start to take on more practice and learn more about pitfalls and challenges. At first, though, keep it simple.</p>
<p>So I guess the foremost pitfalls right now are those of (A) biting off more than you can chew and (B) making the whole thing a conceptual endeavor — trying to understand it with the thinking before getting actual experience through your activity. Much more important is to <em>do</em> it, to <em>try</em>. And that is why the not-quite-right teaching that "there's no wrong way" is offered to beginners. It's essentially encouraging you to just try, and keep trying.</p>
