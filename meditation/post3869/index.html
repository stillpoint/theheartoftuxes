  <h1>A few questions about meditation</h1>

<p>Others are right in pointing to the breath as the possible origin of your dizziness. The breath should not be controlled, since that becomes an ego involvement, which you instead should work to be free of. The controlling habit of mind sneaks in very easily, though (or comes rushing in like a freight train). So developing a habit of relaxing and letting-be is important.</p>
<p><em>Any</em> attitude of grasping at experience or trying to make something happen creates a pressure that will make all kinds of aberrant energetic events much more likely during meditation. Don't try to <em>make</em> concentration happen; just engage gently with the form you are practicing, and when you wander off, instantly and gently return to the form.</p>
<p>I should also mention that many, perhaps most, modern-day people do not breathe naturally at all (breathing shallowly in the chest rather than softly and deeply in the belly), and so many of us need to retrain our breathing; and that does involve some degree of control for a time. This should be done with awareness, and perhaps under the guidance of an expert on breathing. Yoga, Tai Qi, or Qigong classes are possible supports for meditation practice in this regard. You should also be clear on what it is that you are practicing at any given time — don't start playing with your breath when you are supposed to be meditating.</p>
<p>A couple of other possible causes of dizziness occur to me:
An upward movement of energy may be the issue. In one case, this may come from stress or tension, or from a physiological or energetic pattern. Both excess energy rising to the head and deficient energy failing to nourish the head may lead to dizziness. If there are other symptoms, or if lightheadedness occurs at other times, you might want to consult a health professional (a medical doctor or alternative practitioner).</p>
<p>Stress- or tension-induced lightheadedness, if it is not severe, can of course be remedied by relaxing. A key step in sitting meditation is to settle. Let the muscles relax, so that your posture is supported by its good structure rather than by muscular effort. Take a moment to breathe out a huff of relief and let your weight sink into the floor. You can imagine yourself as a boulder or mountain sinking slightly into the ground with its weight, or as a very relaxed animal — you know that feeling of released weight when a cat walks on you?</p>
<p>Overthinking, which most of us are prone to as well, can also drive too much energy up into the head; and if it continues as a habit, and energetic pattern can form that keeps the energy up high in your body. This may very well be the case for you, as you mention a possible OCD diagnosis. It is better for meditation and for your general clarity if the energy can settle low, down into the lower belly. Relaxing and settling your weight is part of this; letting go of thinking, as a lifestyle change, is another part. But often it's not possible to address this pattern directly, and so physical activity is a very important part of most complete meditation training. For example, monks in many communities do hard physical work gardening, chopping wood, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the best tools to help energy settle down quickly is bowing — full prostrations down to the floor, then standing up again, and repeating many times. This is a very integrated activity: the entire body, the breath, the attention, and the effort of will are all working together. After a while, you get tired and the thinking mind settles down and the energy comes lower in your body. So you do this strenuous activity, and then you feel like sitting down; this is a good time to do sitting meditation.</p>
<p>Other vigorous physical activity that involves repetitive whole body-and-breath movement is similarly helpful: the aforementioned chopping wood, digging with a shovel, swimming, or running. Bowing offers you more of an opportunity than these others to focus <em>safely</em> on one activity without distraction; and the effect of that particular movement on your psychology is also significant, as it embodies integrity (bringing the hands together), letting go (lowering yourself and opening your hands) and then a return to your self-possessed strength (standing back up).</p>
<p><strong>If your dizziness may at all be related to a health issue, do get that checked out before doing bowing practice.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, another way to help energy settle lower is to bring awareness to your hands and/or lower belly when sitting on a mat (or for some, to the places where you are in contact with the mat), or to your hands, lower belly, and/or feet when sitting in a chair. When walking, bring awareness to the feet and their contact with the ground.</p>
