  <h1>Can I Substitute Focusing on Breathing</h1>

<p>Yes, you're talking about concentration, which is the relinquishment of distraction. One repeatedly withdraws the attention from everything but the object of concentration. Gradually, the tendency of the mind to flit here and there settles.</p>
<p>Just calming the mind through concentration is not true meditation, but it's a fine pursuit in its own right, and can serve as preparation for (and enhancement of) meditation.</p>
<p>In cases of overthinking, there are a few objects and methods suggested besides focusing on the breath. Breath-focused concentration is also fine, but sometimes the mind is so busy that even beginning the practice is difficult — one has trouble even finding and staying with the sensations of breathing.</p>
<p>Mantra is one recommended method for overcoming runaway thinking. Repeating a phrase of syllables — words — to yourself takes over some of the activity of thinking. It's like using your busy thinking to help yourself. <em>Mantra</em> literally means "mind protection". You do it constantly, so it provides you with something you can return to, helping you avoid going down wrong pathways with your mind.</p>
<p>There are many different mantras. For your purposes, a relatively short mantra that you can repeat quickly would be helpful. When you are calm, you can repeat it slowly and calmly; when you are agitated, you can repeat it quickly. You can even help yourself with your voice: if the thinking is so loud and busy that it crowds out your mantra, whisper the mantra with your voice. If you need more help connecting to the mantra, use a louder voice and even sing it.</p>
<p>Using your voice with mantra, dharani (long mantra), or chanting practice not only helps you connect with the practice, but it also trains your breathing so that eventually you <em>can</em> start working with breath-based meditation. Once you have connected through your voice you can choose to continue either silently or out loud.</p>
<p>You should probably avoid mantras involving English phrases, lest they prompt you to speculate about the meaning and get carried away in thinking. If you want a recommendation, just message me.</p>
<p>Another strategy that is very helpful for overthinking is to involve the body. Various walking meditations, movement meditations, and especially bowing practices can be very helpful in settling the mind. Doing a few hundred or even a few thousand prostrations a day will help your mind settle remarkably — guaranteed! Your body gets tired, but your mind becomes vivid and clear.</p>
<p>Here is part of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1le5tu/i_find_it_extremely_difficult_to_remember_to_be/cbydlh1">my recent post</a> to another meditator:</p>
<p>&gt;In order to assist your mind I highly recommend using a body-based mindfulness practice. The body has a tremendous grounding influence on the mind. Just consider the difficulty of staying mindful in your (disembodied) sleep, and you'll get an idea of the grounding influence offered by the body.</p>
<p>&gt;Some people use breathing as an anchor throughout the day, and that may work for many but it also tends to lead to a manipulative habit where you try to control your state through your breathing. I instead recommend awareness of your foundation, your interface with gravity: When standing or walking, keep some awareness in the feet on the floor; when sitting, keep awareness in the butt and feet; when lying down, keep awareness in your body's areas of contact with the bed or sofa.</p>
<p>&gt;Keeping your mind in your feet (or other foundation) will provide you with a lifeline to the moment, helping you find your way back more easily as well as stay in the moment more persistently. It also has a calming, grounding effect on you overall, as your energy comes down from buzzing around in your head and settles lower in your body. In a sense, the effort of practice can be seen as an effort to settle the energy down, and not be so busy and reactive with the head and heart.</p>
<p>Although using the proper method is important, there are many viable methods. With each method there will be points that you like and points that you don't like, ease and difficulty, triumph and challenge. There is no magic pill, no method that sweeps you off your feet and does everything for you. What makes the magic is your own repeated effort, which means repeatedly letting go of everything and just returning to the present moment without grasping or struggling. When you let go of wanting, holding, grasping, checking, and making, everything can return to its correct place. That is the practice, regardless of the object or method you use.</p>
<p>Some teachers say that you should train with your body, speech, and mind every day; so they may recommend doing <em>all</em> of the above: morning and evening breath-based meditation sittings, 1,000 to 3,000 mantra repetitions per day (you can use a beaded necklace or bracelet to count the repetitions), <em>and</em> several hundred bows/prostrations per day. To this could be added chanting; and the breath-based meditation might be substituted with other object-based or objectless meditations, including <em>vipassana</em>/insight, <em>koan</em> or <em>hwadu</em>, visualization, work with sound, etc., depending on the school and on the predilections of the meditator.</p>
