  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>In my experience with many thousands of seekers and practitioners, the people who really proceed clearly into independence take great, exhaustive measures to test themselves in all kinds of situations and under the close scrutiny of multiple masters.</p>
<p>That is not to say that they jump around from master to master, but that they fully digest a course of training by living it from every angle — student, householder, monk (or temporary monk-retreatant), lover, artist, adventurer, philosopher, fool, addict, failure, hero — and when they think they might 'have' something, some insight or stability or independent freedom, <em>then</em> they get checked by their own teacher, and also travel to see other teachers and see if they can have a free, non-attached mind while doing their style of practice and getting checked by them.</p>
<p>It reminds me a bit of the sharks that gently approach the remoras and other cleaner-fish to get cleaned. These sincere practitioners <em>want</em> to expose themselves to the light. They don't want anything to remain hidden. They don't assume that they know. They <em>experience</em> their knowing, but they've perhaps had enough encounters with their own sly minds to check that they're not fooling themselves yet again, or at least to be very meticulous about their relationship with the truth rather than  take on airs of bravado.</p>
<p>In this way, their process is exhaustive. Not exhausting to them, but taking care to exhaust every last possibility of doubt.</p>
<p>So the great luminary master Milarepa said:</p>
<p>&gt;It is the tradition of the fortunate seeker not to be satisfied with halfway practice.</p>
<p>My root master, a Zen Master, was occasionally asked about whether we can adapt the style of practice or whether the traditions should be changed to fit into our society. He acknowledged that it is necessary to adapt some forms, but that you will still always have the basic issue of form itself to deal with. You will always have to deal with <em>some</em> kind of form; so really it doesn't matter so much what the outer form is, what matters is your own mind's freedom, your own ability to show up clearly regardless of whether the situation is your favorite.</p>
<p>And then the Zen Master said that <em>when you become a Zen Master</em> you can change the form. That is to say, when you have completely digested the course of training and when you yourself have attained the mind of all masters, <em>then</em> you can know what form to keep and what form to let go of. Before that, a deluded person is making the decisions.</p>
<p>If we're just making personal decisions about our own practice, we're mainly the ones receiving the repercussions. If we're proposing changes to others, then we start to suck others into our delusion as well; and we can quickly create a lot of negative activity that way.</p>
<p>If you have faith in a book, and practice hard, and get the full results of practice, and get those results checked by masters, then you can have basis to say "I know what needs to be changed, and why." Many people who practice from a book don't know what hard practice means, because unbeknownst to them their own preferences and habits are guiding their decisions. So although they <em>feel</em> like they're trying, they may not actually be applying effort in the right way. It may be three years into study with a master before someone understands "Ohhhhh... <em>that's</em> what 'hard practice' means!"</p>
<p>Hard practice isn't "I try hard". There's some of that, but that's not the essence. Hard practice means not having an intent in the moment. Complete openhanded presence, with no making, no wanting, no clinging, no avoiding — completely momentary mind. Keeping that mind from moment to moment is 'hard practice'. But until you experience it among others you might not get it in your bones.</p>
<p>All that is maybe one side of the issue — a very important side.</p>
<p>The other side is "Do you trust yourself 100%?"</p>
<p>In the Lojong teachings of Vajrayana (the <em>Seven Points Of Mind Training</em>), one of the practice slogans is:</p>
<p>&gt;Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one.</p>
<p>In part, this means that although there is a great need for the outer teachers and communities, the rituals and commitments and other forms, the more central 'witness' is you. Your own inner witness is primary. You need to trust it.</p>
<p>But human nature being what it is, I can see readers immediately pouncing on this statement and using it to justify <em>getting rid of</em> the outer witness. That's not the teaching. The teaching is that there are two important witnesses, and the inner one is primary.</p>
<p>It's like that saying, "It is said that a man is three things: what he thinks he is, what others think he is, and what he really is." This doesn't say that a man is <em>only</em> what he really is, and that the other perspectives don't apply; it says that all three coexist, but that what's primary is primary, what's real is real.</p>
<p>This is a subtle teaching, and its subtlety needs to be respected, not whittled down to a trite personal philosophy.</p>
<p>Perhaps your question itself is most powerful: "How can I know when I'm acting from delusion?" If you keep that question always, it may illuminate your life in ways that a mere answer cannot.</p>
