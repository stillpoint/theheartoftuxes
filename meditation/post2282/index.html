  <h1>Can someone confirm if this is meditation?</h1>

<p>These are good questions aimed at clarifying the aim and practice of meditation; but they come at it from the wrong direction. People get fixated on the issue of <em>states</em>, but states are a secondary byproduct.</p>
<p>Mind states and unusual experiences are not important and not special. The most important question is why do meditation -- what is it for, and why would you want to do it rather than doing something else with your time and effort?</p>
<p>If you look at our world, you can see that humans have made a big mess, and are continuing to make bigger and bigger messes. We harm nature on vast scales, we kill off entire species daily, we mismanage resources. Even on individual levels we pollute the place where we live with our day-to-day activity. Conflict, full-blown war, and mass genocide are a constant part of our existence, a constant effect we have on the world and on each other. Poverty and starvation are rampant while a few people hoard immense wealth.</p>
<p>In our communities, we fight race against race, social class against social class, religion against religion, gender against gender. Corruption seems to be the rule rather than the exception. Trivial and meaningless pursuits and possessions are marketed and encouraged. Depression and distraction are epidemic illnesses.</p>
<p>In our families we have difficulty getting along and supporting each other; in our personal relationships we have difficulty finding contentment; and even within ourselves we experience discord, disconnection, and confusion -- our emotions say one thing, our ideas say another, and our actions don't harmonize with either.</p>
<p>All of this arises from a single basic ignorance: we don't understand who we really are. We assume ourselves to be something we aren't -- we assume ourselves to be separate, fixed selves. Thus an agenda of separateness and self-defense and self-aggrandizement emerges through our activity. This is the root of our self-harm and our harm of the world: we don't understand our true nature.</p>
<p>This is what meditation is for: to understand and then embody and express our true nature. We live in a thought-made illusion, a mutual dream. Meditation is aimed at waking up from the dream, dispelling the illusion so that we can have correct relationship with ourselves, each other, and the world.</p>
<p>There are many styles of practices called 'meditation'. Not all practices have the same purpose or effect. But true, correct meditation is open-handed. That is, it has no grasping or seeking. You can have a seeking aspiration ("I want to wake up; I want to understand myself and get free") but in correct meditation there is no grasping at any object, state, or result. This is how you come back to reality. If you hold an idea of what is ideal and then chase it, you will be practicing your idea, not meditation.</p>
<p>States will come and go. They are only 'states' because we identify and name them; really they are just the flow of life. For example, sometimes you are joyful, sometimes sad, depressed, neutral, excited, and sometimes you are in transition between states. Those states are distinct because we name them, but there is a smooth, even flow among them. One starts where the other ends, and not even -- they overlap and blend and combine. Life is like this, in constant flux and interconnection. It is our job to go beyond the names and see directly. So it is not the state or the name that is important but the seeing.</p>
<p>Behind all states there is one mind experiencing it all. This is what you awaken to. Awaken to the inner mind behind it all, and correct relationship with life is possible. With your clarity and awakening you will help yourself and all others, even the trees and rivers and sky.</p>
<p>There are various methods. Some have objects, like breath, counting, mantra, visualization, sensation, or visual or auditory objects. Some methods involve self-inquiry, looking into one's own mind with a big, open question. And some methods don't use objects but rest in mind's original open nature, letting it emerge naturally. Also, there is sitting meditation, moving meditation, and mindfulness in activity, which all have various methods.</p>
<p>Choosing between methods should follow understanding of your aim. Some people want to relieve stress or concentrate better; some are attached to special states and abilities. But these aims are contingent, temporary, and by themselves don't have the power to awaken you from the dream of self. Direct seeing, direct experience of mind is necessary.</p>
<p>When you are clear on your motivation, you will be better able to choose between methods. Then you can find a method that fits with your bent of nature, interest, and lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is very important not to be vague in meditation. You should learn one proven method, learn it well, and follow it meticulously. You should understand its purpose and then give yourself over to it without checking or messing around. Awareness of thoughts is one possible form; but the <em>why</em> and the <em>how</em> should be very clear to you.</p>
<p>It is never a bad practice to return to the present moment. Simple presence can be practiced any time. There is no particular state to be found, held, or avoided; just open-handed awareness of whatever is going on at the moment. Not your idea, label, or commentary, but just the plain fact of what's happening.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is <em>relax, and just don't be distracted.</em> Simple. There's nothing special to get. But this not-getting-anything-special is very important and very wonderful. It is real life.</p>
