  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There are a few different ideas being mixed up here, including a gross misunderstanding of what Buddhism (along with its influence on some popular, secular courses of meditation) teaches.</p>
<p>First, there are a few different uses of the word 'ego' out there. A psychologist and a meditation teacher are not necessarily taking about the same thing when they use the word.</p>
<p>Ego <em>doesn't</em> exist, just as 'my body' doesn't exist; it is just a name we give to a collection of processes and dynamics so we can talk about it and learn about it. Originally, it doesn't exist. For example, your 'body' is never the same from moment to moment. So what do you actually point to with the word? What you called 'my body' ten years ago or two days ago is not the same as it is now. Different atoms, different cells, different place in the world, different posture, different conditions and configurations and relationships.... Furthermore, there is no set, fixed thing that can be pointed to: if the heart stops beating, or the lungs stop inflating and deflating, or the blood stops moving, or if its environment is destroyed, or any of the countless tissue and organ processes stops, or if the energy stops flowing, or the atoms stop circulating -- that would be the end of what we understand as 'body'. Body is only body if it is <em>not</em> fixed in time and place. Body is only body if it <em>is</em> in utter interdependence with the environment.</p>
<p>So 'my body' is an ever-changing relationship of ever-changing processes. But because we give it a name, we start to think that it is like the name -- definite, fixed, unmoving, concrete. We live with the concept more than we live with the reality, and our life becomes based on the erroneous concept. In fact, most people think of that fixed concept as 'me'. And this causes no end of trouble. All problems in the world, all acts of violence and separation, are caused by this mistake.</p>
<p>Likewise, the 'ego' is a concept that points to complex, fluid relationships between certain psychic processes.</p>
<p>Let's stay with the notion of 'body' for a moment: If you understand that the reality and the name are quite different, then you can see the issue is not that we somehow have to destroy the (actual) body, nor that we even have to get rid of the name and concept (because it is, after all, very useful to be able to talk about the body). The main thing is that we move beyond <em>mistaking</em> the name for the actual thing. The main thing is overturning our illusion, which is based on our attachment to words and concepts. At the far end of that waking-up process, yes, the sense of selfhood can get completely absorbed, completely disappeared.</p>
<p>So likewise, with the issue of ego, the main thing is not to have our entire life dominated by a mistake about what we really are, but to perceive and function with reality.</p>
<p>Now about the word itself: there's the psychological ego that Jung is talking about, which refers to a sort of managerial faculty that negotiates between outer situations and personal experience and activity, but there's also a somewhat different meaning of the word in spiritual/meditative circles. In the early 1900s, some spiritual teachers took up the language of modern Western science and psychology in speaking of ancient Eastern spiritual concepts. They were seeking a way to convey these concepts to the Western mind. The great sage Paramahansa Yogananda in particular helped Eastern wisdom take root in Europe and especially America through the user of scientific and psychological language. He was one of the major proponents of the notion of 'ego' not strictly as a psychological term, but in reference to the notion of selfhood -- the false idea that we are separate, fixed, limited beings. It is this attachment, this false idea, that all the major eastern spiritual traditions say is to be uprooted (though they may differ as to whether they propose some other kind of <em>ultimate</em> selfhood).</p>
<p>The great master Sri Ramana Maharshi and other yogis of their era also used the term 'ego' to refer to the notion of selfhood. Later in the mid-century, Daisetz Suzuki, Alan Watts, and other Zen teachers and commentators used the term, sometimes in the meaning of 'self', and occasionally also to refer to the psychological meaning.</p>
<p>While the user of language more common to the Western mind helped popularize Asian spirituality, it came at the cost of some confusion (which clearly persists today). At the end of the last century and into our current era, many teachers and writers, like Joseph Goldstein, Mark Eppstein, Bikkhu Bodhi, Chogyam Trungpa, and many others have fleshed out and refined our understanding of the terms.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake that many people make in interpreting teachings about 'ego' is that they construe them to mean that the ego should be obliterated -- that right from the get-go, the meditator is expected to deny or destroy 'self'. This is a mistake. Unfortunately, it is taken up by both practitioners and opponents of the spiritual pursuits. What really gets destroyed is the <em>falsehood</em>, the illusion based on attachment to words and concepts. (In Buddhism, this is called attachment to 'name and form'.)</p>
<p>In order to overcome illusion about selfhood -- the so-called spiritual sense of the term 'ego' -- it is in fact necessary for the <em>psychological</em> ego to be strong enough to allow for open-handed, faithful investigation and contemplation. Without a strong ego, habits of fear, confusion, and reactivity create obstacles to progress.</p>
<p>But if we think 'my body' or 'my ego' actually exist, or that what the ideas point to are as fixed and limited as the ideas themselves, that would be a big, big mistake.</p>
