  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>These are good questions; but first of all, slow down.</p>
<p>Don't be so fast to jump to conclusions or develop theories. Don't immediately formulate ideas, but take the time to listen, to let teachings sink in, and to steep in unknowing for a while.</p>
<p>Don't assume that the answer lies only in the realm of what you imagine or conceive. If that were the case, you would never move beyond the way you already see things; your understanding would never grow.</p>
<p>Don't be so fast to react to words. Don't attach to their meaning, but see where they point. Words can't hold reality, they can only point. Thoughts can't hold reality; they can only point.</p>
<p>Don't try to understand everything at once. It takes time for teachings to sink in. It takes time for your old way of understanding to change. Desperate clutching at understanding makes you tight and inflexible, a poor vessel for teaching. Let your interest and curiosity move you in new ways. Take the time to dance with new possibilities.</p>
<p>That is the first thing: Don't go so fast.</p>
<p>'Ego' is just a word. In psychology, it refers to an important function of our mind, a sort of managerial function. In the way some spiritual teachers use the word, <em>ego</em> means the sense of selfhood, the deeply held idea of being a set, separate 'someone'.</p>
<p>This is the most universal mistake among humans (and among beings in general). We think of ourselves as separately existing entities with fixed qualities. We think we <em>know</em> what we are, and what other beings and objects are, simply because we give things a name. It is essentially an immature, childish understanding of reality; but it is the most universally shared view.</p>
<p>We think "I am me, right here... and that is so-and-so over there." We point at things and name them and believe that we know them through their names. Like a child that learns the name for an animal and then believes that the job of knowing is over, we jump to the conclusion that we know everything we can name: "That's a pine tree; that's an oak; that's a cloud; that's Joe; that's Wendy; that's a paramecium; that's a star...." And so on.</p>
<p>But in reality we don't know what these things are. We don't understand what everything is made of; and we don't see everything in its true state of flux, moving with everything else, shaping and being shaped by everything else.</p>
<p>For example, in everyday activity people act as if they are their body, and as if their body is some fixed, unchanging thing. But when we consider more deeply, we can see that this body is always, always changing. Moment by moment, atoms are shifting, vibrating, exchanging with the atmosphere. Air becomes breath, enters the lungs, mixes with blood, circulates through flesh, diverts into countless cells, participates in chemical reactions, and returns to the environment... where it is moved as breezes and tornados, wafts up to the reaches of space, and is circulated among and within trillions of other beings, becoming <em>their</em> cells-in-action.</p>
<p>And even when we say "my body's cells", we think of a fixed set of unmoving things, but that is never the case. Cells are always being created and dying, food and water from the changing landscapes of the Earth hurtling through space make their way to us through countless pathways, move through our mouth, our organs, our vessels and muscles, our colon and urinary tract, our pores and ducts... transforming into what we call 'bone', 'ligament', 'tendon', 'sweat', 'pus', 'sebum', 'synovial fluid', 'fingernails', and so on and so on. And all of these constituents of 'us' are in endless movement, arising and relating, shedding and transforming, and feeding various processes in the body or environment.</p>
<p>Even if we loosely view this vast collection of processes as 'the body', this body is always changing in form. 'You' are not the same form as you were when you were born. The body is not the same. The form of your body was different at one year of age, and five, and seven, and ten, and is different now... and now... and now. Its cells have completely changed, and its shape and size have changed. Even from moment to moment, your body is changing, growing in some ways, diminishing in others, aging. </p>
<p>The shape of this collection of processes and relationships we call the body is also constantly changing. We point to our chest and say "this is my body" but in saying that we think we are pointing to a set 'thing'. We don't take into account that one moment we are standing and another moment we are sitting, and the relationship of these various processes is in a completely new configuration. We don't then point to ourselves and say that this is now a new 'thing', a new state of being. We don't acknowledge movement.</p>
<p>Soon the body will dis-associate, its parts will let go of their close relationships, processes will cease, and it will 'die'. Our experience will be of heaviness, weakness, coldness, dimming isolation, unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, and final stillness. The body's various constituents and processes will return to the environment through innumerable pathways. It will become ash and dust, soil and food, bird feather and worm flesh... **But we don't point to all of these various pathways and acknowledge "That is me, and you." We think we know just what we are.</p>
<p>This is just briefly looking at the body. How much more can we say about the movements of energy, thought, sensation, memory, imagination, emotion. Sunlight is conveyed in photonic energy through food and becomes our every action and experience. All of these things require energy! But when we get frustrated we don't recognize "Oh, the sun is becoming frustration." We don't change posture while watching television and recognize "Oh, cosmic energy is moving as this posture and experience."</p>
<p>We claim thoughts as 'our' thoughts rather than seeing that they arise from a collision of ideas and experiences from countless other people. We claim emotional situations as 'our' situation rather than recognizing that they come from, belong to, and return to the universe. <em>And we don't know how this universe is moving, where it comes from, and where it is going.</em> We can only give names and labels to things; we can only describe, but we don't really know.</p>
<p>So this is just a small glimpse into what is really going on. But we still point to the body and say "this is me" and maintain an extremely limited, stuck, immature view of what that is.</p>
<p>So this vague, misunderstood, limited, stuck sense of separate selfhood is what spiritual teachers will sometimes call 'ego'. It's the illusion of selfhood, denying all evidence of interrelation and change.</p>
<p>And this illusion makes all the problems and evil that humans create. Because we think there is a 'me' that needs to exist in a set way, we fear for it, defend it, place it ahead of every other being. We act in selfish, pretty, indulgent ways, following base cravings, being enslaved to habits, being controlled by conditioning. Why do the people of every culture think that <em>they</em> are right? Why do people of every country think that <em>their</em> way needs to be defended and preserved? Religion fights religion; country fights country; communities and families are divided by selfishness; and even within ourselves we are divided -- our body says one thing, our idea says another, our feeling is conflicted, and then we try to hide all that with masks. We behave one way with our parent, another way with our friend, and yet another way with a stranger.</p>
<p>We don't understand correct life.</p>
<p>We selfishly disregard and abuse the environment. We hold onto petty desires and ignore the suffering of those around us. We go to war over resources we should be sharing and ideas we should be letting go of. We objectify and abuse each other. Our minds are perverted with desirous habits. We live in a constant baseline of fear, mistrust, aggression, disregard, and craving.</p>
<p><em>All of this comes from the illusion of separate, fixed selfhood. All personal problems and all shared problems come from our basic misunderstanding of who or what we really are.</em></p>
<p>So this is the correct purpose of meditation: to perceive reality and return to what we really are, for our happiness and the happiness and well-being of all others.</p>
<p>The purpose is <em>not</em> to go into nothingness, but to become real. If you lose the mistake, what's left is what's really there, which is very plain and simple, not special. But this 'not special' is very special.</p>
