  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's not good or bad; but it is not a good way to get the results one usually seeks in meditation.</p>
<p>'Good' and 'bad' refer to cause and effect. Let's look into the <em>effect</em> of swapping techniques.</p>
<p>The reason for having one object of focus is to have something very clear to return to. Sticking to that one object provides you with a sort of mirror: you get to see better how and when you go away in distraction. Because there is one clear object to stay with, it becomes very apparent when you are away from it.</p>
<p>As you continue returning and departing, departing and returning, you get better at returning and you see more of your mind's habits. What takes you away, what causes you to leave the thing you have vowed to stay with? One layer is mere agitation, the broad distraction of the human mind, which is especially agitated in our modern world. When that settles, you may see other things that cause your mind to move: pride, theorizing, sexual thoughts, lingering anger from the past, dreams of attainment, attachment to feeling, and so on. Sometimes dullness takes you away. Sometimes the desperate fear of feeling vulnerability, or sadness, or joy drives you to distraction.</p>
<p>Seeing all of this and being able to return from it repeatedly is greatly supported by the one object of focus. There is no doubt about what you should be doing with your mind; you only return to that object. But as soon as you entertain another method or another object of focus, doubt enters. Suddenly you <em>don't</em> know what you should be doing with your mind.</p>
<p>So then you try to figure it out, to weigh the pros and cons, judge which is doing better for you. Maybe you go back and forth for a while because you're checking the effects, seeing which is easier, or which one feels better. <em>This is all distraction from meditation!</em> You are no longer meditating, but rather playing out a drama. You play the roles of psychic scientist, intrepid explorer, victim of circumstance, perfection-seeker, confused student, and others. It is not meditation. It is a drama <em>about</em> meditation, but it is not meditation, which (in your breath or mantra method) is returning to the object of focus and being with it.</p>
<p>That's not to say that you can't or shouldn't try out different methods; but you should give each their right time and effort. Be very clear on what method you are trying and how long you will sit with it. And give yourself time to learn the method and apply it. Don't give up so easily.</p>
<p>If you give up easily, it tells your habit-mind that you are easily distracted, and the habit-mind will keep sending things to distract you. This mind — the 'ego' or self-image — only wants control of you; it doesn't want meditation, in which it dissolves for a while. So the habit-mind always tries to get you to be a <em>something</em>, doing something, undergoing something, figuring something out. In meditation, you become one with the object of meditation. The habit-mind doesn't want that; it wants control. So you have to send a clear, consistent message that you <em>will not be dissuaded</em> from meditation. Then gradually the habit-mind will settle.</p>
<p>So maybe choose to practice one method for a month, and then try the other. After thirty days of consistent practice you start to settle in and understand the practice. People practice for many years and still learn new things about the method and their mind. Changing too fast takes away that opportunity to familiarize, settle in, and learn.</p>
<p>Another approach is to try one method in the morning and the other in the evening. Or you can even do one for five minutes and the other for ten, one after the other, if you can keep them clear and distinct. Either way, keep it up for a month or so before you decide your next steps.</p>
<p>If you are changing because of some difficulty, determine if the difficulty is something that requires teaching and a remedy, or if the difficulty merely requires more application. Often the difficulty is just that the mind-habit wants distraction and hates applying itself to attention. If that's the case, you just need to do more, to keep returning, returning, returning.</p>
<p>Yes, quit worrying and just meditate. If you have learned a proven, traditional method, and if you have learned it well, you can do that. But doubt easily enters; so that's another reason to get frequent teaching from one good source — so that a consistent message can sink in past your habit-mind, and can become your own wisdom. If you get bits and pieces here and there they don't tend to penetrate deeply; they stay at the level of speculation, and this only contributes to distraction during meditation and confusion outside of meditation.</p>
<p>Realize that much of the desperation to research also comes from your controlling mind-habit: it wants to know everything; it wants to find the perfect situation; it wants to be all-powerful. But this is all fluff. It doesn't help your life. If you <em>sit</em> and <em>learn how to return</em> from distraction, <em>that</em> helps your life. If you learn how to let go of the clinging, controlling mind-habit, <em>that</em> helps your life.</p>
<p>There is a right balance to finding your own way and following good, wise guidance. I hope you find it and get clear and become a force of clarity in the world.</p>
