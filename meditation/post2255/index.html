  <h1>Is trying to understand life too infinite of a challenge for our minds to conquer?</h1>

<p>So happy to meet you! There is so much energy in your words. I hope you (we!) learn the proper direction for that energy.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>It seems as if the mind is more infinitesimally large than the outer universe.</em></p>
<p>This is right. The mind is not separate from the universe, but includes it. Commonly, people think <em>we</em> and our minds come from the universe; but it is the other way around: the universe comes from mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is only one mind. When you find your true mind, that is the same as my true mind and every being's true mind.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>These thoughts beg for understanding, my mind seeks to rationalize everything from why people act the way they do to what the happiest path and course of action I may take is.</em></p>
<p>This is very appropriate for this phase of your life. You are starting to enter the summer of your life, the season where forms and energies grow rapidly and blossom into many different things. In the spring phase, it's important to nurture the delicate parts of being and to be sheltered from harm. In the summer phase, it is appropriate to start reaching out, exploring many new things, testing boundaries, seeing possibilities.</p>
<p>With balance, of course. The tendency is to spin off into the sky, following the energy. But the energy is not your boss, okay? <em>You</em> have to lead your life; <em>you</em> have to drive the vehicle. That means having the ability to return to plain, momentary reality. Your bursting energy will tend to lead you here and there. If you only let energy and whim guide you, then energy will come and go — it will flare up and then dissipate, leaving you in an up and down cycle — and whim will deepen into self-indulgence. </p>
<p>So to make the best use of your abundant energy you need to be able to return to the simple reality you're in <em>right now</em>. Right now you're — what? — sitting in a chair or sofa? standing up? You're certainly reading these words. Where are your feet? What is in front of your nose? This is very, very important. More important than any big idea, okay? If you are able to let go of everything and reset, returning to the plain unadorned reality, then you can become a great being.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>These thoughts beg for understanding, my mind seeks to rationalize everything….</em></p>
<p>Your <em>thought</em> is that the thoughts beg for understanding. That is the story you make about your experience and reactions. Thoughts are just thoughts, just like trees are trees and clouds are clouds. They don't beg for anything. But when you attach to the idea that they are begging, then that becomes your reality.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't look into things, no far from it — look! Be curious! See deeply without prejudging or jumping to conclusions! What I'm saying is please take care of the stories you make about your experience.</p>
<p>This is crucial: understanding is not rationalizing. These are two different things. Your thinking habit always wants to rationalize and explain. It wants everything in a nice box with a bow on top. This comes from the ego or idea of self that wants to believe that it can hold onto things and control them. The ego or self-idea wants to be in control and keep things all pegged down with ideas so it can feel safe. But the world — reality — can't be pegged down like this. Everything is interconnected. Everything is moving. And, as you have already stated very well, everything is profound and boundless. So the human thinking-habit that wants to rationalize everything often avoids and denies reality. This is a dynamic shared by humans: we check, label, judge, and manipulate something that is already complete and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>When you drink Coca-Cola, you can taste it and understand very well what it is like. Of course, many things can be said about it. We can look into its chemical structure; we can talk about the history of its development and marketing; we can describe the processes involved in its production and the properties it displays when it comes out of the factory. But none of these are direct understanding of Coca-Cola. Tasting it is beyond words, but it is also very, very simple. This is the plain reality you should always be able to return to.</p>
<p>When you see the sky, you understand sky. When you dive into water, you understand water. This is direct understanding, which is the important basis of relative, rationalizing understanding. But people cover up their direct understanding with thinking, and get further and further from the truth.</p>
<p>First, let go of all ideas and return to reality. Then your thinking can function properly. Without the first step, thinking quickly turns to illusion. It makes a false world of separate objects, and convinces you that thinking and knowing are the same. They are not! Taken further, the illusory world made by thinking prompts us to fight about our ideas and force our ways upon others and upon the world. Rather than listening openly, we say "I know" and then do violence to every situation we enter. From our disastrous relationship with the natural environment to the cruelties and genocides we commit, all this violence comes from not understanding the correct place of thought.</p>
<p>In essence, all our personal and world problems come from a lack of insight into who or what we really are. Real insight doesn't come from thinking, but from seeing, from direct experience. So I applaud and encourage your enthusiasm about <em>finding out</em>; and I also caution you to know the difference between thinking and seeing — between your idea, on the one hand, and your true experience, on the other. Don't trade in your true life for a cheap and unsatisfactory substitute!</p>
<p>It is interesting that you mention Plato. His teacher Socrates is seen by some as an ancient western Zen Master. Socrates, like you, always looked into things with curiosity. But he never made assumptions. That is where he was very different from other people. Whether he was meeting with students or philosophers, he would always ask questions, until the point was reached where the questions could no longer be answered.</p>
<p>So Socrates showed many people that they don't know what they <em>think</em> they know. Even today, he is still showing us that. And he said, "Also <em>I</em> don't know. But the difference is that I <em>know</em> that I don't know." (Some translate this as "I understand this not-knowing.")</p>
<p>The not-knowing, the openness to things-as-they-are, is all important. Curiosity is very functional. Unknowing provides the space for things to speak for themselves. If you watch closely without following the ego's urge to make ideas, you can see reality directly, and then you can help all beings with what you see.</p>
