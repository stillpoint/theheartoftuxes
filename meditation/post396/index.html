  <h1>I am not very good with words. Can someone help me explain to my wife that meditation is not about becoming a robot.</h1>

<p>The best convincing will come from your transformation, from your increased presence, stability, and compassion. People don't believe words, they believe action.</p>
<p>Also, people believe in the energy of faith rather than rationale. Perhaps if instead of trying to <em>convince</em> her, you openly share your aspiration -- what you hope to achieve with your life, what suffering and frustration you are working to overcome, what joy you feel in trying something new -- you may be able to establish a heart-to-heart connection about your practice. This is most likely what she needs: to <em>feel</em> that you are there, to feel that you are engaging with life and with a purpose. She needs to feel you, not to get convinced through her head.</p>
<p>This is where men and women sometimes differ. You may tend to think the solution is in the rational realm, because that's how you engage with it. Your wife may be loving you on a whole other level (and perhaps even a more sophisticated one) of emotional sincerity and requirement for your integrity. She may require you to show up in all aspects of yourself -- the body, the heart, the mind, and the spirit all together. She may remain suspicious until you can demonstrate that your ideas, your feelings, and your life direction are all in sync. That is how she takes care of your relationship and your well-being.</p>
<p>Meditation is intended as a <em>cure</em> for robotic response. Our reactions to emotion tend to be very limited; we only try to hold what we like and avoid what we don't like. Furthermore, our movement in life is conditioned by many factors. Our culture, our upbringing, the emotional wounds we've received in life all tend to create deeply ingrained patterns of thought and behavior in us. In many cases these patterns are neurotic, dysfunctional.</p>
<p>People raised Christian tend to think in Christian style; people raised Islamic tend to think Islamic style. Why do ethnic and religious wars continue for generation after generation? It's because we are already robots, slaves to our preferences and opinions. Why do arguments continue in the home for hours, days? We hold on to our own favourite, without being able to change freely.</p>
<p>Meditation means taking a moment that is not in reaction, so you can be with what is real. If your wife would like to try meditation, maybe she can find out for herself what it takes <em>not</em> to avoid anything. She can discover that emotions don't disappear, but are dealt with more consciously and compassionately.</p>
<p>But it should also be acknowledged that meditation <em>can</em> be misused as a way of shutting down and becoming numb. We see many ego characters arise among people who meditate, from the completely detached (= numb) 'holy person', to the arrogant and opinionated spiritual expert, to the psychonaut who goes in search of strange experiences just for their strangeness (and to think highly of oneself for it). One has only to check out some discussions on boards such as r/meditation and r/Zen to see how meditation can be co-opted and perverted by ego.</p>
<p>So your wife is not all wrong. And neither are you. How will you set each other's mind at ease and give each other the space to be what you need to be?</p>
<p>Can you and your wife avoid the robotic attitude of holding on to opinion? Can you freely see the other side -- see not only the other side of the argument, but what the other person fears and values, and ultimately <em>needs</em>?</p>
<p>There is usually a strong investment among spouses, in keeping the pattern of relationship a certain way. Many people see it as a sign of security to never change the dynamics between each other. So when one partner starts to do something differently -- and especially when one partner starts to grow in awareness -- it can be felt as a threat to the relationship. And it may actually turn out that way: if one partner grows and the other refuses to, it often marks the beginning of the end for the relationship.</p>
<p>So your wife may fear that you will become distant and not love her. She may fear that you will become a different person, with different emotions. She may be caring for your own integrity. Or she may sense that if you grow too much in awareness she will not be able to keep up, and you will leave her behind. You may need to acknowledge these concerns and offer compassionate listening and responding before your wife opens to the idea of meditation.</p>
<p>But in any case, you should let no one hold you back from your true potential. If someone expects their partner to be 'less' for their sake, that is selfish and harmful to the relationship, and must be addressed. I'm not saying that's your wife's intent; I'm just encouraging you to stand up for your own evolution, but with understanding and compassion for the fears of your partner.</p>
