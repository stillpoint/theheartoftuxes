  <h1>Meditation is making me feel like I am crazy....</h1>

<p>Yeah, you are crazy. We are all crazy, or have been. The problem is that we're just partly crazy, stuck between holding and surrender.</p>
<p>Your situation is shared by a great many meditators, perhaps millions. 'Dabbling' is enough to show you the situation, but not enough to shift it significantly, to begin seeing noticeable effects. This again is stuck between holding and surrender.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for a beginner to take command of their own mind. Mind-habit is strong, deeply rooted in so many aspects of life, and bafflingly hidden and difficult to take hold of. The very reason it is a habit in the first place makes it difficult for us to see and face. Therefore surrender to external frameworks is, as a rule, necessary.</p>
<p>Environment, physical posture and ease, balance of sleep and diet and exercise, lifestyle and work schedule, practice form, and practice schedule all contribute to your ability to face the mind consistently and learn to let it be. Many people see meditation as just another separate activity among many rather than what it really is: an interdependent part of an integral whole. What you do with your mind and action outside of meditation is every bit as influential on the brain chatter. Doing negative deeds, failing to clarify relationships, hanging out with unclear people, and taking in trivial or disturbing speech, images, and ideas can all make clear meditation nigh impossible for many.</p>
<p>But even significant changes in these areas are often not enough on their own to help the new meditator break through. So finding and following a teacher, and practicing with a group or with Dharma friends is of great benefit. It is difficult to enumerate and describe all of the benefits that come from these associations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the teacher is very capable and has achieved the fruits of the practice she/he teaches, you can receive good teaching â€” even <em>perfect</em> teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can avoid misunderstandings that could otherwise take you down side roads for years and lifetimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can be quickly corrected on slips and errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teaching can arrive directly in the moment (in face-to-face interaction), helping you see how it relates to your everyday life, and helping you digest the wisdom and make it your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can receive the good teaching regularly and frequently. It can sink in more deeply, beyond those layers of chattering mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can not only see the living example of accomplishment, but you can receive their qualities in your being, intuitively, energetically, and through emotional genuineness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You benefit from the teacher's stability of mind. That is, your mind is partially tamed just by association with the master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You gain inspiration from fellow practitioners, seeing them strive and move past similar obstacles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You gain experience through both the successes and failures of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You become aware of aspects of both cognition and expression of the teaching that you might never consider or contact while isolated in your own view and approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your own preferences and egoic attachments are challenged through interaction with others â€” you can't always get your way â€” and thus your character is developed in a way that is for all practical purposes impossible on your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The energy of others can keep you going, when alone you would flag and give up; and it can help you be more clear, when alone you would succumb to dullness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The witnessing from others, as both peers and teachers see your efforts and successes, promotes enthusiasm and confidence. It puts a seal on your attainment. This in turn gives you the resources for further effort and breakthrough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The human emotional need for community and mutual love is much more available among sincere practitioners. The human emotional need for solitude is likewise more available, as relationships tend to be less 'sticky'; you are given your space. All the usual relationship difficulties will still be there, but there will likely be two key differences: (A) more general awareness, and (B) an overarching and mutual motivation to live kindly and sincerely, and to always be moving toward awakening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, there is no need for further self-blame or frustration when your center is not strong enough to deal with the tumult of the mind and of outer circumstances. It is simple cause and effect: the center is not strong enough. At that time, you need to use positive outer structures as support, and to gradually eliminate the negative outer structures that form obstruction and upset, until the center becomes strong enough and independent.</p>
<p>In the meantime, practicing independent center in meditation is also necessary. That means not letting the brain chatter about "uncontrollable", "frustrating", "unable", and all those other negative thoughts, take power over your will to keep letting go and returning. These thoughts are equal to any other thoughts, pleasant or unpleasant; they have the same illusory nature. So your job is to keep letting go of the thought in the moment and keep returning to the meditation method in the moment. Let go, return. Let go, return. It is a very simple and neutral act. No drama, no extra thoughts.</p>
<p>For clarity in letting go and returning, you have to be clear about the method and confident in your application. Therefore two basic foundations are necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You direction should be clear, or in the ongoing process of being clarified: Why meditate? Why stay alive? What is the good purpose behind it, the purpose beyond petty self-centeredness? When direction is clear, momentary doubts that arise during meditation (and in life) can quickly be abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be working with a good, proven method; you should learn it in a complete and organized way â€” the why and the how of it; and you should apply it meticulously. This strict application provides the mirror for you; when the form is strict, you can see very clearly when you depart from it; but when the form is unclear, sloppy mind and insidious patterns are allowed to continue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
