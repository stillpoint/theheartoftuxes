  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>But does this not have an obvious answer? We eat everyday because it's a basic human need and if we didn't we would starve and eventually die....</em></p>
<p>You (we) <em>assume</em> the answer is obvious, because you base the answer on your false assumption of what you are -- a false sense of selfhood. So your answer, like the automatic answer of most people, is the same as a dog's answer. "I want... I need... I, I, I...."</p>
<p>This is just being trapped in biological imperative. It is not yet connected to your life's direction beyond merely surviving and scurrying to satisfy urges. It is not yet aiming outside of fear and desire.</p>
<p>But when you begin to connect with the possibility of a <em>spiritual</em> direction -- a direction that puts awakening ahead of mere surviving, and compassion for others ahead of fear for self -- then a tremendous energy is released. This is called a 'true' direction because it actually has somewhere to go, whereas the answer that says "we only eat because we have to" does not really have a direction; it only goes around and around and around, reacting to needs and urges.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that we don't need to eat; but I'm saying that what we are all about -- what our <em>days</em> are all about -- can be something greater and clearer than just filling our belly, chasing sensual attachment, and then soon dying.</p>
<p>Connecting to this true direction aligns and prioritizes everything we do. All possibilities are open to us, but we can be very clear on what furthers our direction and what blocks it. That is the basis of knowing the true purpose of meditation and using your practice correctly. But it is something that usually comes gradually, through consistent effort to contemplate and clarify: "*Why do this? Why do anything?"</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So we should question everything, compare them to the direction we are going, find out whether it is the correct direction in which we want for ourselves and adjust if not?</em></p>
<p>You are not expected to think about everything. It's not intended that you second-guess or hesitate or brood. But if once in a while you sincerely visit what is called the <em>Great Question Of Life And Death</em> -- if you look into it, say, every morning -- then the question will embed in your mind and work in the background without you having to ruminate with your thinking. Gradually it will work on you. Then when this background question meets an appropriate condition, it will blossom into knowing.</p>
<p>It is like a seed that you nurture. In the darkness of the soil, deep in your mind, it germinates. Then when it meets an appropriate field, <em>pop!</em>, it sprouts and begins to unfold.</p>
<p>The 'condition' or 'field' may be a practice group that has a clear, compassionate intent; or it may be a master or advanced practitioner who embodies clarity and love with every action -- is a living example of clear direction; or it may be hearing and repeating great vows that take you beyond your small self-involved mind. Or maybe clear direction will blossom through you directly when you spontaneously help someone: you will see how your eating has turned into aware and compassionate action, and you will know deeply "Oh, <em>this</em> is what my life is for"; it will be more than an idea, it will be a gut knowing.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>In saying that, is a bit of fear and mistrust not healthy at times as it stops us from making wrong choices?</em></p>
<p>Fear has a healthy function of encouraging awareness, and an unhealthy function of inducing inertia, paralysis. Which function is at work here?</p>
<p>We can't avoid wrong choices. If we never make a move, so as to avoid all wrong choices, that in itself is a wrong choice that denies life. What we <em>can</em> do is keep our eyes open and keep moving. Then when we make a mistake we can quickly correct it. The mistake actually becomes a benefit, because we will have learned something new in our own experience, not depending on second-hand opinions. If we stay sincere and keep moving, the mistake gets transformed into wisdom.</p>
<p>So Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki said:</p>
<p>&gt; Enlightenment is one continuous mistake.</p>
<p>And Zen Master Seung Sahn said:</p>
<p>&gt; 'Zen Master' just means someone who quickly corrects his or her mistake.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I have a question for you, how come you don't teach?</em></p>
<p>Thank you for your vote of confidence, but, first, I can't be responsible for someone's spiritual unfolding. I can pass on my experience and knowledge if it is helpful, maybe like a hiker who knows some of the terrain that lies ahead, or like an older brother who can sometimes offer advice.</p>
<p>Second, this is not a proper forum for complete learning. In-person is much better. Until you get deep into face-to-face teaching you can't imagine what you're missing.</p>
<p>Third, I prefer to remain anonymous online, partly so that what I write can stand on its own merit and it doesn't become about personality or popularity, and partly to free me in my offline life.</p>
<p>Teaching requires integrity. It is a sacred relationship. There will be some who jump at the chance to think of themselves as a teacher; but I know that being a teacher really means you are always a student, always embodying fresh and humble engagement with life.</p>
<p>There are many good teachers out there. Take steps.</p>
