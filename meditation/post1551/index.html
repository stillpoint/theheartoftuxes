  <h1>Meditation, ironic processing, and musical performance anxiety (looking for help)</h1>

<p>I wasn't expecting any particular answer. I was responding to your request for help.</p>
<p>Have I done something to warrant sarcasm or mistrust? If so, please let me know.</p>
<p>You say that you have difficulty with thoughts that you want to get rid of, but the more you try to dispel them the more prominent they become.</p>
<p>It's a vicious cycle that can't be escaped by employing any of the steps of the cycle. So making a point of dispelling or ignoring certain thoughts is not helping.</p>
<p>This is something I mention a lot in giving guidance about meditation, but it's also a problem we have in regular life: checking. Checking means stepping outside of the situation and looking back on yourself in order to see how you're doing, judge your condition, judge the situation, and steer it toward what you think it should be. So all is fine when you are playing music, but your mind habitually checks to see how things are going and whether your thinking is okay and whether your attention is on your playing. At that moment, the vicious cycle starts.</p>
<p>In checking, your step outside and look back at yourself, so your energy turns back. Instead, your energy needs to radiate from you â€” to start from the inside and keep going out. You can help yourself in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Latch onto something more vital than the checking or the fear that prompts it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weaken the checking habit and strengthen your returning (to the active moment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why I ask what moves you to play music. There you will find something that can carry you beyond checking.</p>
<p>I am also a musician. And I've done many kinds of performances, musical and otherwise. I've had the butterflies in the stomach and the weak knees, I've crashed and burned on stage, and I've also experienced that exhilaration of synchronizing with other performers and with the audience. One of the greatest things that ever happened in my performance career was learning to trust the deep, meaningful, noble reasons for my performance. At some point I discovered that sincerity was more powerful than fear.</p>
<p>When I find myself at a loss in front of others, I ask myself "What do I really want to say? What do I really want to share?" (And if nothing appears, then that is what I share. Sometimes "nothing" is the sincere expression of the moment.) We have an innate generosity, which is that radiant nature â€” the energy that comes from the center and moves outward. Really, it's love that saves you on the stage. If we are devoted to sincerity, even if we fail it is okay, because we've acted wholeheartedly. There's nowhere for failure to enter, because our heart and our expression have only been moving outward, offering to others rather than taking something under the table.</p>
<p>If, however, greed and manipulation are part of the motive, the energy turns back inward and fear and failure can enter. So whether your first statement ("to impress others and validate myselfâ€¦") was a joke or not, it is still significant that it was your first statement. I suspect that this is actually the gateway of irony for you: you are trying to manipulate others into serving your own egoic purposes. That is what you have to surgically excise; the issue with annoying or self-defeating thoughts is secondary. You have to clarify your true motive. If you are insincere in your performance, you will reap the result of it; that is, you will not be able to escape the manipulative efforts of your own mind.</p>
<p>So the first part is to be sincere, and connect deeply to what you purely love about music. The unity is what you love. Even if you <em>crave</em> recognition and adulation, they are empty; and at some level you know they don't satisfy. But unifying with other musicians and leading an audience to an experience of that unifying is a gift that you can share. Music can reveal many truths that words can't reach. The unifying and the truth-telling are, I believe, what lie beyond the selfish things we sometimes grasp for as performers.</p>
<p>Next, you can practice letting go of checking. Meditation is one good way to practice this, but it can also be done any time once you understand what checking is. When you find yourself stepping outside of the <em>experience</em> (outside of the pure activity), let go of the need to check and return. In meditation, this means returning to the method of meditation, so a clear structure of method is beneficial. In playing music, this means listening and participating â€” listen to the deep intent to share, listen to the energy of your fellow performers, and listen to the sound. As a musician, I don't think there is ever a time when I've "listened enough". There's never a time when we've reached the pinnacle and there's no more to be heard. And the moment we stop listening is the moment we've essentially given up on the music. Then it becomes more about "I, my, me" than the music; and that's the pitfall.</p>
<p>So it's not that you force away certain thoughts or find a trick to overcoming them. It's that you make a momentary choice to return to what is real and valuable â€” the expression you are sharing. If you <em>don't</em> find it more real and more valuable than the thoughts you are engaging with, then that is your decision. If you keep engaging with thoughts instead of listening and expressing, you are <em>deciding</em> that the drama of the thought is more valuable than your music or whatever you are expressing in the moment. And if that's actually true, then maybe you should quit music and find something you <em>can</em> get behind.</p>
<p>In meditation, if the thought persists, at some level the meditator has decided that the thought is more valuable than clarity and peace. That is very common, for people to decide that! We put our thoughts on a pedestal, and worship even terribly negative thoughts. If we really wanted peace, we would choose it. And if you really want clear music, then you would choose it.</p>
