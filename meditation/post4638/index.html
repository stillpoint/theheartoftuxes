  <h1>Does my back have to be straight?</h1>

<p>The juxtaposition of "rigid" and "upright" in your post is telling. Don't assume that upright means rigid. Sitting posture doesn't have to be rigid, but it should be upright — upright in body and mind. The body supports and reflects the mind; the mind supports, reflects, and guides the body.</p>
<p>For example, if you slouch in your body, it will encourage your mind to be lax, dull, and defeatist. If you rely on a back support, your mind may not be trained as well in independence.</p>
<p>You are a living symbol, an expression of your inner life. But when starting meditation, the mind is not stable; it flits here and there, habitually attaching to objects and playing out old patterns of reaction. Therefore we use the body as well as the meditation method to help bring the mind the mind to stability. Noble, open, calm, stable, awake and aware posture gives constant signals to the mind. Then soon you can identify your original mind, which has those qualities, and you can rest in it.</p>
<p>Rigidity, then, has these two aspects: physical and mental.</p>
<p>The <strong>physical</strong> needs to be addressed by forming a very stable base — getting the butt and knees solidly on the sitting platform(s), with the help of folded blankets or firm cushions where necessary (and it's usually necessary) under the hips, perhaps under one or both knees, perhaps even under the hands and forearms to keep the shoulders from bearing their weight. The physical is also addressed by taking account of the inflexibilities and imbalances that lead to tension. It takes some learning, and likely takes some applied practice outside of meditation time to increase core support and joint tone and flexibility. Tone and flexibility must be trained together, because flexibility without some firmness can lead to injury and anyway doesn't provide enough support for comfort.</p>
<p>The <strong>mental</strong> aspect is addressed primarily by correcting the motivation and approach. Why are you meditating? What are you trying to achieve? If meditation is only 'for me', it will have what Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki called "a gaining idea". You will be in one place, and the thing you imagine you need to get will be in another place, and you will make effort to try and get that thing. Already that is tension. Already that is illusion. If you repeat it, perhaps making greater effort, you drive tension and illusion deep into your practice and into your being.</p>
<p>The correct approach is openhanded. No gaining idea. Don't want or make anything; only follow the method. Don't try to push away certain thoughts or experiences. Don't try to attain or hold certain thoughts or experiences. Don't attach to good or bad feeling. Don't check and judge your situation, your condition, or your relationship. Only put it all down.</p>
<p>This <em>put-it-all-down</em> mind is your original mind, which is always spacious and serene and comfortable. You don't get it by trying to get it. You already have it; you already <em>are</em> it. You just have to put down everything else that has built up on top of it, all those assumptions and attachments and habits that get in the way of your natural relaxation.</p>
<p>Both physical and mental aspects are important. They support each other. Ultimately, they are the same. Within deep meditation, there is no separation between body and mind; there is no separation between world and mind. Mind is everything, and there is no 'thing' called mind. Your original still and open awareness is an experience, a living reality rather than a concept.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Picture mind and body as a graceful mountain, like Mount Fuji. The base is utterly stable, unmovable. A stable base allows comfort above. The top of the mountain rises — almost wafts — upward. Solid, stable base, top opening or wafting up and out. The bodymind should be like this in meditation.</p>
<p>Notice also how the solidity of a mountain comes from its settling. A mountain has no agenda. It has settled on itself, found its ground, found its arrangement of least resistance. Anything precarious sinks down to its most stable place. It is like Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching says, or like Jesus says in the Bible: the high shall be brought low, and the low shall be uplifted. If you make an effort to hold onto a certain form in your body or mind, it will eventually be broken down by exhaustion or circumstances. But if you settle into the ground, with humility and sincerity, the relaxation will uplift your body and the open sincerity will uplift your mind.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/354j35/problems_with_back_posture/cr137su">previous post</a> from another thread, in its entirety:</p>
<p>&gt; A healthy back is not straight, but gracefully curved. Returning to the natural curve of the back is not a matter of forcing, but of undoing set patterns of use. There is a spectrum of modalities, from forceful hands-on, like Structural Integration and some Chiropractic... to very gentle hands-on, like Osteopathy or Craniosacral Therapy... to vigorous hands-off, like various Yoga forms (Hatha Yoga, Restorative Yoga, etc.)... to gentle hands-off (awareness based), like Feldenkreis or Alexander Technique. I've heard that many meditators have had good success with Alexander Technique. Some forms of standing meditation also help you find your own structural integrity. Zhan Zhuang, for instance (from Qigong and Internal Martial Arts) helps you develop sensitivity to the tensions you hold and the energy blockages that manifest because of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the issue is relaxing or even stretching physical structures that have become bound up. Heat and stretching regimens can be effective. It has also been proposed that a minute or so of hanging from a chin-up bar can counteract hours of improper sitting in a chair. But many curative techniques have to do with a relaxed return to neutrality or balance; so for example, just lying down (face up) on a firm flat surface can help the spine return to its proper form. Using a bolster or folded towel or blanket under the mid-back, you can lie with your arms spread wide; the chest opens, and the 'hump' in the middle of the back is stretched and relaxed. There are many poses in Restorative Yoga that can help the body rediscover its integrity: some degree of stretching may be included, but the main point is dropping the types of movements that have been harmful, by finding postures that support the body enough for it to relax.
&gt; 
&gt; Without a particularly strong core and legs flexible enough to provide a very stable base when sitting on a mat, it's difficult for most people to relax completely in sitting posture. So postural work should be done in addition to meditation (i.e., outside of meditation period). This work may involve lying down, or other supported postures, so the body can completely relax and you can start to listen deeply to its natural setup. I'd suggest you check out Alexander Technique, Yoga Therapy, and perhaps Zhan Zhuang for starters, to see of any of them are a good fit for you.</p>
