  <h1>Clear mind uneasy body</h1>

<p>(Part 1 of 2)</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I just want to know myself, who I am, what I am before I leave this place.</em></p>
<p>That is wonderful. It really goes to the motivation shared by so many seekers, to find their true self and understand what really is of value. This is worth visiting and clarifying every day.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I'm looking for meaning....</em></p>
<p>I'd also invite you to consider that your deepest meaning will not be only for yourself. That is, the truth that you will find is the truth for all others as well. All other beings are in the same boat: confused, suffering, holding things that are impermanent, avoiding things that are real, going around and around in cycles of pain. Everywhere you look in this world you can find suffering beings.</p>
<p>Realizing this, you begin to find compassion not only for your own situation but for everyone's -- it is <em>one</em> situation. This great broad compassion is what gives you the power to cut through habit and ignorance, to keep going through difficulty, and to accept the broad and all-encompassing teaching. Your true self is boundless. Great compassion will bring you to your boundless nature.</p>
<p>Conversely, although it is natural to seek insight and benefit for yourself, if you seek it <em>only</em> for yourself your mind will stay small and uncomfortable, like living in a very small room. So for the sake of your broad, boundless heart and mind, please remember that your waking up can help everyone else, we who are in the same suffering situation.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...black and white are in harmony.</em></p>
<p>This is a good, effective mindset for practice. The openhanded mindset shows up equally for positive and negative, for things you like and things you don't like. It is a very broad and stable mind. This points to correct relationship with the moment.</p>
<p>(This is very much in line with the Kwan Um School Of Zen's teaching and practice. You might be interested in their training.)</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If I have a practice it is self forged but I believe it is what is commonly practiced here, to observe what is happening inside my mind here and now.</em></p>
<p>In meditation it is critical to be free of doubt. Once you start to advance, and as obstacles arise, and once more material starts to bubble up from the depths of your mind, absolute stability and freedom from doubt will be necessary.</p>
<p>Since we are already working under our own blind spots and ignorance, those faults are built into whatever we create by ourselves. There will come a point (and maybe it has already come) where your blind spot or your doubt will get in the way of your meditation. Therefore it is best to learn a proven method from a teacher who has practiced it, received its full results, and awakened through it -- someone who can show the way completely reliably and without a shred of doubt, every step of the way.</p>
<p>So it's not that there is a parent telling you what you should do, but rather there's a clear cause and effect relationship that shows you what is a wise and practical approach, and what is not a wise and practical approach.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>It is the realization that no matter what is happening in the world around me I can choose to let go and see what happens or to cling on and suffer. ...The moment is simply the safest place to be.</em></p>
<p>You already understand a lot about grasping; and there is a lot of energy in your writing too. Openhandedness or Unknowing is indeed the safest spot. This is because it is the only real spot; everything else besides letting things be what they are is a mere fabrication or illusion. (I think you will have a good connection to the Kwan Um School's teaching.)</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to <em>feel</em> safe. Don't depend on feeling. Show up no matter what arises.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>My practice is seeking storms and observing what occurs when I let go of the boat.</em></p>
<p>True, the letting go takes courage. But when you meditate, don't seek anything. Rest in your original nature, which just perceives but doesn't try to assert influence. If storms arise, <em>fine</em>. If flowers come up, <em>no problem</em>. If a video of the daily news starts to play, <em>okay</em>. Openhandedness/Unknowing is the approach.</p>
<p>If you make practice into a heroic venture, then an ego character is the one doing the practice: the hero, the victim, the holy person, the wise sage, the good student, and so on. These are all characters made up in the mind. True practice is very plain, flavorless.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I feel as if I have stumbled upon a corner of my mind then that's been long forgotten and alienated.</em>   </p>
<p>Gradually over time you can become aware of and reclaim more of yourself. It will include hidden talents, unacknowledged powers, flaws kept secret, unconscious neuroses, emergent relationships, and eventually all beings and phenomena everywhere: these can all be integrated as precious aspects of self.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I seriously wonder too if I am just being led around by stronger, more deceptive desires. ...Wouldn't finding harmony in that desire be counter-productive...?</em></p>
<p>You don't have to check or steer your practice much. Checking and steering are activities of the ego. In meditation, the ego tries to assert itself, to control the whole project. So it is necessary to completely let go of checking (trying to see how you're doing, and then controlling the outcome).</p>
<p>This is another reason why it's so important to be rock-solid in knowing the method and doing it: in the moment when checking appears you can immediately know it, let it go, and return confidently to the method. If the method isn't clear, it's easy to think that certain trains of thought are valuable, so you end up following them; or it's easy to think that you need to adjust what you're doing so it will 'work' better. These are ways that we fool ourselves and abandon the method.</p>
<p><em>Outside of meditation</em> you can once in a while check how you are doing: Are you going forward or backwards? Did you make good use of your time? Do any changes need to be made? Is your practice compassionate or selfish? You can check this way maybe at the end of the day or once a week. This is where ego becomes very useful in its management of your activity. But most of the time, don't check, only do it.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I still have a lot to let go of.</em></p>
<p>Like all of us.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>From what you've read of this, am I still failing to grasp a critical requirement?</em></p>
<p>Everyone has their own path. There are recommendations from experienced and wise guides; and we need to be humble enough to absorb them. But there are also the messages from within; and we need to have the confidence to listen and act on them. You have to consider whether my recommendations (or the recommendations of any teacher) make sense. You have to use your own intellect and research to find out whether this is something that can reasonably be trusted.</p>
<p>I do recommend learning an established and proven method. I do recommend practicing with a living teacher and group as soon as possible. You can't even imagine all the ways you fool yourself; and you can't even imagine all the different kinds of benefits received from a good teacher.</p>
<p>At the very least, being able to check in with someone else can be very valuable. So often we are too close to the issue to see it or know how to deal with it.</p>
<p>In addition, a method that tracks the thinking can be difficult to sustain on your own, because it brings you into such close contact with your thinking that your thinking may then take over the process. Until stability is developed it can be hard at times to know the difference between being the watcher and getting wrapped up in thought.</p>
<p>Many meditations taught to beginners involve an independent object of focus, so the meditator can very clearly disengage from ongoing thoughts -- the meditator then can know quite clearly whether they are 'in' the method or 'out' of it.</p>
<p>(Continued in part 2)...</p>
