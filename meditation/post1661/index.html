<hr />
<p>title: I have a beginner question: I have began meditating using some good instructions. But I am having trouble with mindfulness -it seems harder and a bit separate from meditation. How do you do it? write a journal?

<p>&gt;*so the way to be more mindfull is simply to try and feel the physical sensations around you? how do I know if it is working?
*</p>
<p>That's <em>one</em> way to be mindful. It's a good way, among other good ways. Let's not get hung up on the word 'mindfulness' and instead focus on the aim. What is one trying to achieve, and why?</p>
<p>We're trying to have a good relationship with reality. We're trying to be okay with things as they really are, rather than being tossed about by our illusions, our wants, our dislikes, our attachments, our agitated thinking, and so on. So mindfulness, or the practice of awareness, means that we decide it's a good idea to keep coming back to what's really happening rather than living up in our heads as we usually do.</p>
<p>Feeling physical sensations is a good way. But in mindfulness practice it should act as an anchor, a way to help you return to the real moment. It shouldn't exclude other awareness.</p>
<p>For example, if you <em>only</em> focus on physical sensations and try to tune out sights and sounds, or suppress thoughts, that's not mindfulness. (It might be part of some concentration practices that focus the mind, but it excludes some of your experience so it's not a broad awareness practice.)</p>
<p>While you keep in touch with your bodily sensations, you can still allow other information in. You can still know that your hands are reaching for your backpack... you can still listen to your friend speaking, and understand them... you can still see that you have such-and-such thought about such-and-such event. In fact, having that anchor to return to will <em>help</em> you be more open and engaged with life. It is precisely because you can better see you have such-and-such a thought coming up that you can be free of it — the thought doesn't have to control your action; it can be considered just another of the things happening in this moment, not your only destiny.</p>
<p>How do you know it is working? Well, you may not. It is not your job to know it is working. It is your job to keep coming back to reality, to the real moment.</p>
<p>If you try to find out if 'it is working', that means you're trying to judge the situation. You're trying to add a thought, a label to what's going on. That's not mindfulness. That's being momentarily lost in thinking and judging. So when you notice that you're trying to put a label on your experience or get some kind of certainty through thinking, your correct mindfulness practice is to let it go and return to actually feeling your body, as it is. That will help you to perceive the broader moment, as it is.</p>
<p>This <em>as-it-is</em> is of utmost importance! It is the only real thing. Labels and judgments are not real, they are the activity of your mind, which creates a whole illusory life for you. Your job is to repeatedly put that down and let reality be.</p>
<p>The challenge is that the illusory life — the thing that we <em>think</em> we are — wants, craves, yearns for certainty. It can't stand reality. It can't stand the openness of reality. It can't stand the boundlessness of reality, as one thing blends into another. It can't stand the ever-changing nature of reality. So in a way, you have to decide which you value more: the illusion that wants certainty, or the reality-as-is. The former brings you trouble; the latter brings you freedom.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are signs that appear over the long run. When you practice mindfulness consistently you will find your mind becoming more balanced. You won't be pushed around as much by the hope of gain and the fear of loss. You will take the ups and downs of life with greater ease.</p>
<p>You will also find your priorities falling into place in a more healthy way. You will naturally align with things that are truly important, such as your health, clarity, and spiritual development, and the well-being of others; and you will naturally let go of the unimportant things that the illusory life attaches to, such as ideas of success, indulgence in trivial pursuits, and looking for satisfaction in external things that can never provide lasting satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is over the long run. These and other good signs will appear. But you shouldn't look for them or try to get them. Only continue your momentary awareness practice very purely, without clinging to anything. Only perceive. Then for sure the signs will appear by themselves.</p>
