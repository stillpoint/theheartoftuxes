  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Thank you for your detailed response.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>The OP didn't ask for guidance on how to meditate correctly. ...OP might not be in the mindset to benefit from it.</em></p>
<p>OP said:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Things started to become pretty uncomfortable all around here, it became psychologically intense and physically uncomfortable...</p>
<p>This seems to invite response on why it got uncomfortable and intense, and how to overcome that. That means correct practice is necessary. At least it's beneficial to know how you can get closer to your aim or further from it depending on how you relate to breath.</p>
<p>It's true that OP may not be in the mindset to receive what I wrote; and on the other hand she/he may very well be in the mindset to receive it. We don't know; there's not a lot of information. I responded to what I heard in the writing and what moved in me. I think the more conspicuous point here is that you were not in a mindset to receive it.</p>
<p>That's okay. This is a forum. We invite different posts, different persepctives. And we can assume that declarative posts all start with a tacit "In my opinion...."</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Your writing about the breath needing to be in balance seems to indicate that the OPs breathing technique was not balanced...</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>...could have been caused by things unrelated to the bodily orificies where the breath enters and leaves the body.</em></p>
<p>I said that balance and imbalance have effects â€” results. Effect follows cause. And I said <em>when</em> one tries to control the breath, certain problems can appear. You seem to read some nastiness into my writing that wasn't there, or at least wasn't intended. (Sorry if you took it that way.) This again leads me to wonder what got triggered in you, and what you want to say about it. If you want to point out the particular offending phrase, I can clarify it.</p>
<p>You've very right that there are many other possible causes for disturbance. But as OP asked about breath and we're talking about breath, I responded on how breath can influence chemistry, physiology, mood, etc.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>What does it even mean that the breath is balanced?</em></p>
<p>That's a great question. (This is how we have a conversation.) I think my initial post was quite long enough, even if it was only the first part of a very deep and often subtle topic. I mean, your question is the kind of thing that is taken up for years... decades.... Thousands of guides and scriptures and teachings have focused on that question. And I think you'll understand if I suspect that you would have taken me to task even more if I had continued on fleshing out the topic even more.</p>
<p>We haven't heard from OP in response to my post; so wouldn't you have found it presumptuous to continue giving instruction? I mean, with one hand you chastise me for saying too much and with the other hand you chastise me for saying too little. But if you want to have the conversation, we can continue to look into the topic.</p>
<p>&gt;*I wouldn't assume big phrases like this to be understood the way they are intended. *</p>
<p>You think they're big phrases. Maybe someone else doesn't. But what you assume to be the case or not to be the case is your own assumption. On this point as well it seems that you're putting words in OP's mouth and mine rather than owning up to your own discomfort. Maybe <em>you</em> don't like the phrasing. That's fine; you don't have to like what I'm writing, and you're welcome to contribute your own writing if you have something you think would be more helpful.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...made my woo-woo sense tingle</em></p>
<p>Thank you for that. This is a good example of owning your own discomfort â€” if you name it plainly rather than blaming my words for your own reaction. Do a lot of discussions on meditation make your woo-woo sense tingle? How do you feel about electricity... space... imagination... emotion... consciousness... and countless other iterations of 'energy'?</p>
<p>Is there something you want to look into or clarify with regard to 'energy'? It's just a word, just a concept we use so we can talk and learn about practical elements of meditation and other mental/spiritual technologies.</p>
<p>Have you encountered the term 'energy body' before?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...the OP might be completely unfamiliar with....</em></p>
<p>Again, I think the point here is that <em>you</em> are bothered. We haven't heard from OP; and the option to ask about what is written is always there. If you read my posting history over the past few years you'll see that I'm quite responsive to questions.</p>
<p>Sorry if you don't like the style of my writing. What can I do? If there's a style that you like better, maybe express it yourself. Build up our community rather than tearing it down.</p>
<p>Have you heard of Coyote teaching? It's a term from American First Nations culture, but it applies to a kind of teaching that is common among many cultures around the world. It is the teaching that leads one along the path of discovery. If everything is put in your lap at once, you will not appreciate it. This is human nature. But if a question piques your interest, it may lead you to the next step in learning... at which time new questions can arise. For those who don't have patience this can seem like a ridiculous style: "Why don't you just <em>tell</em> me?!" But for those who have followed that kind of teaching, their own growing knowledge and wisdom prove its effectiveness.</p>
<p>All this by way of saying: the path is open for you or OP or anyone to follow up. "What constitutes balance?" "What levels?" "How does breath affect me?" And so on....</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...phrased in an absolute way....</em></p>
<p>You quoted it yourself: "in general". I didn't say this is the only way. I said "in general" and "for basic meditation". I also said, above, "there are many good methods". So you are reading absolutism into my writing. Once again, it seems that you have been triggered by something but have not yet expressed your own view, your own advice, or what vulnerable part of you has been touched.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Why should it be this way? Why can't it be another way?</em></p>
<p>Rather than 'should', which can be taken as a sort of moralistic proscription, we might talk about cause and effect. 'Should' in this case would be a short-hand way of saying that if you do things a certain way, you get certain results; and if you do things another way, you get other results; and therefore, if you want certain results you 'should' accumulate their effective causes.</p>
<p>So we can certainly look into why things should be done a certain way. And it's not that they can't be done another way. There are many ways. If your aim is broad, may methods and styles will suffice. If your aim is specific and extraordinary, then very specific and strict causes are required. Not because being strict is better in some moralistic sense, but because those are the causes leading to the particular result.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to look further into a particular point, we can turn from pointing fingers to looking into the topic at hand and hopefully elucidating it. What kind of explanation or evidence do <em>you</em> want? Or what kind are you qualified to give?</p>
<p>I hope you receive this well.</p>
