  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Absolutely. Really, all meditation is for the sake of others, including all people and animals, and also unseen beings.</p>
<p>But there are definitely specific practices to direct compassion and blessings to others. (My apologies ahead of time; this post will be Buddhism-heavy.) You can pick any one of these and use it to fulfillment; the volume of suggestions is just to show the variety of possibilities out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the most informal and accessible is prayer. You can do a formulaic prayer, or you can make your own sincere prayer, hold it in your mind and heart, and give it voice aloud if you like. You can put your hands in the prayer gesture that is universal: palms together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thankfulness practice is also a thing. Many people do this, both in secular life or as part of broad religious practice. Whether at the end of a practice period or at the beginning or end of the day, you can consider the things you are grateful for and feel the gratitude, then direct that warm feeling out to the other person, wishing them well. The benefits you've received become beneficial energy that you send out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking about what you can do for another purpose is sometimes a nice practice, but for the most part you don't have to think or try to be something special. You only have to show up openhandedly. If you show up, and see, and feel, then what is required will be clear to you and you can respond in the moment. If you only think about it, you run the risk of imposing your thought-up idea in situations where it is not the best thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point reminds me of the wonderful greeting card saying:
 &gt;"If things get any worse, I'm afraid I may have to ask you to stop helping me."</p>
<p>In Buddhism there are many ways you can direct love and blessings to others. This is not restricted to your own psychological experience (though of course it works on that level as well), but actually transmits support to the other person.</p>
<ul>
<li>The method that sounds most appropriate to your question is called <em>Tonglen</em>, which translates as "exchanging suffering". It is a visualization practice that connects with breath and also with heartfelt intent. There are many sources of instruction online and in books, as well as through Vajrayana centers (Pema Chodron is one of the most popular proponents of Tonglen practice).</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic framework of Tonglen is that you breathe in another's suffering, taking them as your own, and breathe out your blessings, sending them to the other person or being. Breathing in, visualize pain and troubles as dark, hot, sticky substance that you breathe in. You offer your unconditional love in this way, unburdening the other of all negativity. Breathing out, visualize the very best of what you have — your good fortune, your vitality, your love, your best wishes, all your talents and capabilities and potentials — taking the form of cool, white light that rides on the breath and enters the other person. This is also given unconditionally.</p>
<p>One of the magical aspects of this practice is that as you do it you discover your own bottomless well of blessings. People worry that they will be taking in dangerous things or giving up something they need, but when you do it unconditionally it brings you to your indestructible, integral, blessed being — the true self that is pure radiant love.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are also the very well-known and widely practiced <em>Brahmavihara</em> practices, known as the "Divine Abidings" or the "Four Immeasurables", because they are the practice of radiating four boundless aspects of your true being. The most well-known of these is <em>Metta</em>, or Loving-kindness practice. The others are <em>Karuna</em> (Compassion), <em>Upekkha</em> (Equanimity), and <em>Mudita</em> (Shared Joy). You can do any or all of the practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Tonglen, there are many online and print sources teaching how to do Metta practice. In general, you first generate the Lovingkindness by connecting to a person or experience that brings forth your soft warmheartedness and wish to offer goodness to others. You can remember a time when you experienced a touching moment, or when someone benefited you without asking anything in return, or you can think of a being who always seems to be there for you without clinging (like a teacher, or even a beloved pet).</p>
<p>Once the Lovingkindness has been kindled and you feel that warmheartedness in you, you can then begin to radiate it. There are a couple of ways to do this so it is truly a boundless practice. The first way is to offer it to categories of beings, like those closest to you (i.e., your wife and other loved ones), then to friends and family, then to people you know, then to neutral strangers, then to people you have difficulty with or enemies, then to all beings everywhere in all dimensions.</p>
<p>The second way is to radiate in the 'ten directions', first in front of you (through your living space, neighborhood, city, country, planet, and all space); then to the left, behind, and to the right; then filling in the in-between quadrants; then completing above and below. It ends up being a completely global radiation of love, unconditionally and boundlessly.</p>
<p>This kind of practice can also be directed specifically to one person that you think of, or to any person you happen to be with at the moment. You can basically do the same practice, generating the warmhearted feeling and intent, and sending it out to the other person.</p>
<p>Or you can perform Metta (or any of the Brahmaviharas) throughout the day, perhaps paired with a sort of mantra, "May I be well, may you be well."</p>
<p>If you do a breathing-based mindfulness practice you can also link it to Metta: breathing in, "May I be well." Breathing out, "May you (and all beings) be well."</p>
<ul>
<li>Thich Nhat Hanh has given very many teachings on relationship, and has offered many specific practices. See for example his book <a href="http://read.goodweb.cn/PDF/p32/True%20Love.pdf"><em>True Love – A Practice For Awakening The Heart</em>,</a> based on the Brahmaviharas but taught in Thich Nhat Hanh's own unique style. Other of his books and teachings also talk specifically on what you're asking about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh also offers mantra practice for communicating clearly with loved ones (apply as appropriate to the situation):</p>
<p>&gt;    Darling, I am here for you.</p>
<p>&gt;    Darling, I know you are there and it makes me happy.</p>
<p>&gt;    Darling, I know you suffer and I am here for you.</p>
<p>&gt;    Darling, I am suffering and I need your help.</p>
<p>&gt;    Darling, this is a happy moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finally, you can study the Four Ways of Giving taught in Buddhism:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving necessities (helping with practical gifts)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving supportive speech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving insight into cause and effect (teaching practical things, both worldly and spiritual)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity-action (sometimes called 'together-action', which at a high level means unifying your mind with the other, and at a basic level means putting down your opinion and just doing their kind of action with them).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the greatest gift you can offer is the meditative mind that is openly present and ready to respond, but without any preconception. This already is love.</p>
