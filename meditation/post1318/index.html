  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Good' is a relative term. We can say it means that the teaching enables you to progress toward a goal that would otherwise be most difficult or impossible to reach by your own hit-and-miss efforts.</p>
<p>Good teaching is so broad and inclusive that it would be exhaustive to begin mentioning all its benefits and areas of focus. Some internet sources and books have very good teaching, but it's in a limited context: it may speak very accurately and profoundly on a topic; but it can't necessarily convey to you how <em>you</em> can get there.</p>
<p>For relatively shallow, temporary goals like feeling a bit better or getting some stress relief (which in themselves could be quite involved practices), a book or app or online source might be sufficient. But the more exacting and exalted your goal, the more you will need to harness resources, regulate your life, gain insight and understanding, and be meticulous and complete with your practice.</p>
<p>For instance, following a breathing pattern of a deep inhalation and a long (about twice as long) exhalation for a few minutes can bring about relative calmness for an agitated person. But if that person wishes to gain insight into the root of the agitation, go beyond it, acquire lasting stability, practice unconditional love, wake up from the dream of life, and save all beings from suffering, any of these aims will require a quite more sophisticated training.</p>
<p>When we are left to our own devices, our own habits and our own ignorance inevitably creep in and take over. Initially it happens without our awareness. Depending on the individual's innate awareness, the moment of recognition may come soon through self-awareness or it may come much later by dint of their inability to progress, and their errors and the suffering they create. The attached, limited mind is not able to provide the unattached, unlimited view for itself. Therefore, frequent, consistent access to a teacher and teaching is necessary â€” access to a source that <em>can</em> reliably provide the perspective beyond ego, and that furthermore can not only teach the steps to be taken but can vouch for and embody them because the teacher him/herself has attained the goal, and has learned to heal the many kinds of mind sicknesses people are afflicted with.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous misconception about meditation these days that it is solely a mental activity, and that it can be isolated from the rest of life. Some people actually <em>count</em> on that notion, trying to force peace or insight upon themselves while avoiding the responsibilities and interactions necessary for maturation. In truth, the mind, the heart, the body, the world, and the spiritual realm are all interconnected, inseparable. In order to make significant progress in the profound technology of meditation, the other factors of physical and emotional health, correct relationship, integral lifestyle, responsibility for environment and society, and spiritual perception are all important factors.</p>
<p>'Good' teaching addresses all of these categories of life, in very clear, practical ways. It speaks appropriately for the level and capacity of the student. It adapts appropriately to the time and situation. It nurtures each aspect in its right season, securing the foundation for each new time of growth.</p>
<p>A good teacher embodies the practice. So it is not just a mind game, not just theoretical. The student can see the evidence of the teaching before them, in real life.</p>
<p>A good teacher is profoundly clear, able to reflect the student's mind back to them in the flash of a moment. Complete confidence is based in attainment of clarity through devoted practice, not in dogma or speculation. Mistakes can be quickly corrected, rather than becoming woven into the student's perception and way of living. Doubts can be quickly addressed, furthering the student's knowledge and clearing the way for more and more profound states of meditation.</p>
<p>Indulgences, habits, attachments, addictions that would otherwise swamp and control the student are overcome through the guidance and stable presence of a good teacher. Just being near the teacher brings forth a joy and contentment, teaching not only the thinking mind but the whole being.</p>
<p>Meditation can indeed be very simple. Only pay attention. It is very simple; but can you <em>do</em> it? That is the issue. Who can actually <em>do</em> the simple thing?</p>
<p>Many people avoid teachers because they don't want to be held accountable. It is fear, more than any legitimate reason, that controls their activity: they are afraid of being seen, of having a clear mirror held up to their pettiness and attachment. They want the fantasy of meditation without the stringent reality of it.</p>
<p>It is a very common attitude. One thinks one is opting for freedom. It turns out to be just the opposite: attachment to one's own view and preference. People think freedom means they get whatever they want. So they try to shield themselves from outside influence, from knowledge, from being witnessed clearly â€” all to preserve their own <em>favorite</em> way. But in the attempt they shut out the possibility of every going beyond their own preference, their own narrow mind.</p>
<p>So in closing I'll share what Zen Master Dogen had to say about <em>good</em> teaching. He said that good teaching always feels like something is being pushed on you, like you're being imposed upon. That's because it directly impacts your <em>ego</em>, your cherished pettiness. In doing so, it liberates you from your small self and opens the door to great freedom and great love.</p>
