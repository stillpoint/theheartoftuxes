  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>We believe that words and thoughts are real; so rather than living in the actual world, we live in the world made by thinking.</p>
<p>For example, we move about our neighborhood as if we know what everything is, just because we have names for things. We think that what we call a "tree" is what a tree really is; and likewise, a house is a house, a dog is a dog, and so on. But a tree is not the name 'tree'. In French, 'tree' is <em>arbre</em>; and in Hawaiian, 'tree' is <em>laau</em>. Our names for things indicate set, standard, separate, unchanging things; but reality is moving, varied, interconnected, and impermanent.</p>
<p>What is a tree, <em>really</em>? Seed DNA has moved in synergy with earth, rainwater, air, and sunlight to produce an ever-changing collection of cells that are constantly processing and storing and transporting earth, water, air, and light energy. And so what are 'earth', 'water', 'air' and 'sunlight'? They are landscape formed by innumerable forces... vast cycles of streams, rivers, oceans, vapor, clouds, consuming beings, piss and sweat and transpiration... exchange of gases between earth formations and plants and animals, and originally formed from stellar material... and the very substance and energy of the enormous and distant star at the center of our solar system. So this is only <em>part</em> of what a tree <em>actually</em> is. And at some point, a seed was 'tree'; and at some point, 'tree' dies and rots and becomes earth. You can walk through the forest and see earth in the shape of a tree, with some bits of bark and moss and maybe some new little sprouts coming up. Be we don't see that as 'tree'. We don't live with this actuality, we live with an incredibly dumbed-down, limited, cookie-cutter concept.</p>
<p>(Even further, a tree has countless lives in the consciousness of countless beings. Various animals or people will have had very different histories with a particular tree. For some it is home, for some it is shelter, for some it is firewood, for some it is an obstacle, for some it is a vague fragment of a romantic excursion in their memory, for some it is a dream symbol — is there one real tree among those; are they all real; are they all unreal?)</p>
<p>This same error occurs with all objects and phenomena that we name. Most of all, it happens with our own conception of who or what <em>we</em> are. We live as if we are the body. Even though we receive evidence every day that the body is impermanent, ever-changing, some parts arriving and some parts departing, <em>in our thinking</em> we hold the notion that the body is something stable, and that the body is what we are. When someone asks "where's Joe?", we point to Joe's body. But part of Joe's body is now scrapings in the bathroom sink and dust on the road and shit in the toilet. We don't point to the toilet and say "there's Joe". And we don't point to the air that Joe has not yet breathed, but will, and say "Joe's right here around us". Scientifically it is true: the air around us becomes our body and our activity; the water from the tap that came from the river that came from the sky becomes our body and our activity; but we don't live as if those scientific facts are true. We live as if we are isolated compartments.</p>
<p>Just as above with the notion 'tree', our bodies and minds are completely interdependent with all other things in the universe. This is called the truth of Interbeing.</p>
<p>Even if we are a bit more clever and think "Okay, I am the mind then", we still attach to thoughts very deeply, and believe in the reality of thoughts. So we identify with our thoughts — our stories, our opinions, our memory, our knowledge. We don't see that these too have been given to us and shaped by our families and societies and cultures and world. The content of our mind is also part of Interbeing.</p>
<p>So we don't know who we really are; and we don't know the true nature of the world. We think of impermanent things as permanent. And we think of interdependent things as having separate existence. We live as if we were our bodies, and as if our bodies are going to live forever. And when we retreat to the 'personal space' of our minds, we believe in the reality and importance of our thoughts, and think that our <em>thoughts</em> are who we are.</p>
<p>This is illusion.</p>
<p>There is one thing, though, that is not created or conditioned, does not depend on anything else, is not born and does not die. This is the true nature of self, which many spiritual paths point to and try to find. And some people find it. Since it is beyond limited thought, it can't be found by thought. One has to go beyond (or before) thought to find it. That is what meditation is for.</p>
<p>If you can let go of all concept, in that moment reality appears by itself.</p>
