  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's important to understand the aim and function of meditation. When your aim is clear and you understand the reason why the method achieves the aim, you can surrender yourself to the method without checking. The checking (all these thoughts reflecting on what's happening to you) only gets in the way and distracts, taking you out of the actual experience.</p>
<p>And actual experience is in some respects the bottom line. We are getting at reality, being in our true experience rather than trying to make or avoid something, or being lost in our heads.</p>
<p>The range of aims based on this 'bottom line' is wide. Some people only want temporary relief from mental pressure; some want health benefits; some want to improve their own prospects for happiness; some are willing and eager to transform their character, to become better members of the world; and in the higher reaches of aims, some have strong intent to wake up from the dream of life completely. And the highest aim, beyond complete enlightenment, is achieving complete enlightenment <em>for all beings, everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>So this is indeed an extremely wide range. Many online articles and discussions only focus on the very lowest, yet still positive, aims. But in any case, the bottom line of returning to reality is shared between all of these motivations. Our relaxation is relaxation <em>within reality</em>; our happiness is happiness <em>with reality</em>; our waking up is waking up <em>to reality</em>.</p>
<p>So meditation method assists us in returning. It helps us open our hands and non-do, ungrasp, refrain from touching, 'stay with'. The method should not be conceived as a conjuring. You don't make up a mind-state and try to build it and hold it. That is involvement with something <em>made</em>, not with <em>things-as-they-are</em>. Our stability and contentment arise when we remain unmoved by the changes of mind and the changes of world.</p>
<p>If you can do that just by remaining still, wonderful. But most of us need the support that meditative method provides, including a very clear object to which we return. Most beginner's methods, and many advanced methods (some of which are exactly the same) involve a single object to which the meditator returns. This allows you to practice, train, and gain skill at letting go and letting be. You develop your ability to be unmoved by the thoughts that arise, such as the ones you list or any others.</p>
<p>The ego, the controlling aspect of our sense of self, only wants to assure its survival and control. It is not interested in reality, surrender, merging, moving, transforming. It only wants control. So it actually generates many of these thoughts. And when it finds thoughts that grab your attention strongly, it knows that it has achieved its control over you. That's why after a meditator overcomes the first broad, random distraction, another type of thought tends to appear. The controlling mind may send something dramatic, something fearful, or something disgusting in attempt to draw your attention away from the process of <em>being real</em>.</p>
<p>And if you are wise and stable enough not to get engaged with those negative-seeming thoughts, another type of thought may arise, which is the positive-seeming thought: ideas about how to improve your meditation or your life (or your relationship, etc.); comparisons of techniques and strategies; self-congratulation for doing so well... 'spiritual' visions and feelings; manifestations of energy or strange new states; extreme comfort; thoughts of being awakened....</p>
<p>These seemingly positive thoughts are just the next escalation of the thinking, controlling mind that seeks attention. It's all still fabrication, still objects of mind. <strong>This is very important to realize! Every good idea is still thought. Every special state is still a mental object.</strong> The aim is not to get caught by <em>any</em> of it.</p>
<p>&gt;As a flickering lamp, an ever-moving cataract,  <br />
the shimmer of a star in space...  <br />
an illusion, a dewdrop, a bubble on a stream...  <br />
a dream, a cloud, a flash of lightning —  <br />
view all created things like this.</p>
<p>You don't have to be Buddhist to learn from these lines in the Diamond Sutra. This is how we are to view <em>all</em> objects and experiences that appear in or out of meditation (but especially <em>in</em>), as mere transitory manifestations of mind, mere projections. If the author of the Diamond Sutra were alive today, he might have included the metaphor of a movie, in which the images we trust are mere insubstantial projections.</p>
<p>So you are to resist the temptation to tinker with method or manipulate your experience. Only return to the method. Be completely faithful to the method. There is no reason to divert from the method.</p>
<p>This requires that you actually learn a proper, proven traditional method, and learn it from a proper, reliable source (someone who has attained its fruits and can vouch for it through direct personal experience as well as by ferrying many others to attainment with it), and learn it well and completely. When these conditions are fulfilled, you can reasonably have faith in the method and let go of the thoughts in your mind that are like little children with busy hands, looking for their toys.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the issue of your method. You say you are listening to the sounds of the birds, the wind, and nature. How do you define those; how do you separate those out from other sounds? What makes those more essentially viable, more worthy, than other sound? To label them is to make objects of them and believe in their separateness, which goes contrary to the correct aim of meditation. Essentially you give up your true listening and instead work on creating an illusory world of objects. Although many meditations do separate out objects, they would normally stay with <em>one</em> object rather than letting the attention fly here and there. This seems like a misconceived, self-invented method that involves picking and choosing rather than stable awareness and equanimity.</p>
<p>If you invent your own meditation, your own inherent ignorance will be built into it. Methods are passed down not so you can have your own favorite situation, but so that you can move <em>beyond</em> what you already are, and <em>beyond</em> what you have been for so long. The method is to take you beyond what you — so far — can conceive of; so devising your own method (which comes from your own limited conception) is not sound strategy on that account. Therefore you need to learn a proper method from a proper source.</p>
<p>Since your own method seems to involve picking-and-choosing, of course agitated picking-and-choosing thoughts will tend to arise.</p>
