  <h1>Has anyone have a total control on their $exual energy? What helped you get this raging fire under control?</h1>

<p>Release the pressure <em>in your mind</em> before it builds to the point where you find the need to release it by acting out. So first — this moment — let it all go, put it all down, forget everything but what is in front of your face.</p>
<p>Making a big story about it is a trap. Building an issue in your mind against which you fight is actually a psychological strategy to stay within the addictive cycle. You build pressure in your mind, and then of course you feel justified in releasing the pressure because it has become "too big". The starting point is always just this moment: release the whole thing. Release the issue, release the frustration, release the need to know what to do, release the sense of urgency about meditation, release your whole life. Just return to what is in front of your face.</p>
<p>So I ask you: what is in front of you face this moment?</p>
<p>"Total control" is a myth, although the ability to direct energy is not. But thinking of it in terms of control is a danger; it speaks of suppression of something that by nature is in constant movement, constant flow.</p>
<p>While suppression can be achieved by various obsessive and unnatural means, it produces negative effects such as rebounding episodes (when the energy builds up greater than one's ability to suppress) and inevitable psychological shadows where the suppressed energies find other, unconscious, outlets (which may include aggression, projected resentment, and self-harm).</p>
<p>The issue is not suppression or "control" of sexual energy or behavior in terms of imposing your will. The issue is coming to terms with reality. Rather than disowning sexuality and sexual behavior, one has to first accept it and what's behind it — and what's behind it is ultimately our anxiety about emptiness. It's our fear and avoidance of emptiness — ungrasped, boundless, open being — that drives us to re-becoming. We seek something definite, something that will establish our seemingly comfortable selfhood, something that will overshadow the feeling of powerlessness or non-existence we fear.</p>
<p>That re-becoming takes countless forms in our lives. Just as we seek new conception and body after we die, we seek new conception and ego characters or roles throughout our life stories. We seek experiences that (we hope) will give us a sense of selfhood or respite from what we perceive as the nothingness, uncertainty, or overwhelming bigness of life: from addiction to sex or drugs or power, to neurotic self-cutting, to pursuit of peak experiences and bliss, we habitually seek to engage with life on our own terms, controlling the experience.</p>
<p>Our salvation lies in the other direction. We need to turn around and move against that stream of habit by practicing a more open-handed relationship with life. In terms of sexual matters, we need to let go of the reactive relationship, whether the reaction is to act out or to deny and suppress. Learning to relax and be with ourselves <em>as we are</em> is the necessary first step, and the necessary continued practice. This means both overturning the mindset of sex as something wrong or dirty, and deepening the ability to be with the flow of energy without reacting and trying to control it.</p>
<p>This points to some deeper, more essential issues in spiritual practice. Your difficulty highlights the necessity of establishing correct direction and correct relationship <em>before</em> seeking to build or control energy. </p>
<p>Kundalini practice is appropriate within its traditional container: close study with, guidance from, and submission to a master who can guide every aspect of your practice. Within this formal relationship, the welling-up of energy can be addressed; but without it, one's own habit and untrained, variable mind are overwhelmed by the energy. The wishful thinking of a generation of pop-yoga teachers is not good enough basis to start playing with energy.</p>
<p>Sex intensifies. That is why the Hindu yogis and the Taoist masters alike urge us to be in our right situation before engaging in sexual acts. We should be healthy in body, loving in heart, and clear in mind when engaging in sex because our body situation, heart situation, and mind situation will be intensified by the sexual energy. Angry sex intensifies the anger; depressed sex intensifies the depression; attached sex intensifies the attachment.</p>
<p>Performing energy-based meditation practices brings us into much the same relationship with our energy. We need to be in our right mind; we need to have established a strong and clear direction: <em>why</em> practice? What is the correct purpose of the practice, the correct function of our life? This needs to be clear, because the energy built up in the practice will intensify whatever mind we bring into it.</p>
<p>Thus, if you are not able to maintain correct direction yourself (as most of us are not able), you require a proper container — a guide, community, practice setting, and method that will keep you going in the right direction when your habit says otherwise. If that container is not available to you, it is best not to play around with energy. Instead do meditation practice that establishes your correct relationship with the moment, and energy will develop more naturally and gradually in harmony with that relationship.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>One thing stopping me from meditation is losing my sexual energy through masturbation.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Whenever I get a sexual thought it flows downward....</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>...I am its slave....</em></p>
<p>Upon reading your post it becomes clear that you need to take more care with your words and thoughts. Nothing is keeping you from meditation unless you are convinced it is. Your own thinking is what keeps you from meditation. Your own thinking makes the decision "oh, now I can't meditate." So take care with your words. Say instead "I have the idea that something is keeping me from meditation."</p>
<p>Also check whether it is true that whenever you get a sexual thought energy flows downward. Is that true, is that inevitable, or is it just your idea? Perhaps this is based on something you've heard or read about sexual thoughts and energy. Take care not to buy into stories. Take care not to couch your difficulty in terms of an inevitable cycle that you can't escape. The fight between "down" and "up", between "bad" and "good" is the trap, but that trap is made completely by your own thinking.</p>
<p>Who has mastered desire or habit by eliminating it? Perhaps it is possible; but it's kind of a moot point for most of us. We need instead to deal with <em>our</em> reality. I have habit. I have desire. What does it mean to be aware of that? What does it mean to have compassion with that, not just in a vague or general sense, but in the way I use my mind when the habit or desire arises?</p>
<p>One famous zen master smoked habitually even until his death of lung cancer. It's possible that we will not resolve in this lifetime the mystery of the forces that drive us. That's not the point of meditation. The point of meditation is to open our hands to it all and perceive the true nature of mind. We do our best to correct our character; but the central point is not that we try to be "better", the central point is that we get to the bottom of the self behind all of it.</p>
<p>I encourage you to look into and practice openhandedness. In fact, taking openhanded mudras (postures that embody noble uprightness and in which the hands are opened, palm-up) could help you start to <em>be with</em> your energy more instead of instigating "for" or "against" battles with it.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It also occurs to me that when your center is weak you need to use outer supports to help your mind establish good (practice) habit in place of pointless or negative habit. Changing your environment and the people you associate with can be a helpful support. Eliminating stimulating influences (online porn, TV, etc.) from your living space can help. Establishing a healthy schedule with balanced sleeping, eating, working, and playing will help to naturally regulate and calm your energy. (Yoga/Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine offer whole dietary sciences with programs for calming your sexual energy naturally so that it can build without being stimulating. Overeating and eating too many animal foods are thought to cause sexual overstimulation, as does oversleeping.) Activities that help you express yourself creatively (which after all is the basis of sexual energy) and/or happily become more intimate with your internal energy can replace negative patterns.</p>
