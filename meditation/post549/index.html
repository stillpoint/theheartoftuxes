  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I read from your response to comments that the issue has to do with family members barging in.</p>
<p>Is the anger there for good reason? Are you making too big a deal about 'your' meditation, or is this something important that you would hope would be respected and supported? You are the one who is in the best position to judge whether you're being too touchy or whether you need something important to be recognized by your family members.</p>
<p>If your boundaries are unclear, you have to communicate them. If others don't understand your needs, you have to convey them in a way they'll understand. That part is your responsibility.</p>
<p>But if your boundaries and needs have been clearly communicated, and people still disregard them; then you may have to find other ways to (A) get across that it's not okay, (B) get what you need, regardless of what others do, and/or (C) let go.</p>
<p>(A) First start with communicating. The vast majority of sticky, annoying issues in families and other relationships can be resolved through communication. Rather than blaming others, try to explain what's important to you and why. When people understand why something is meaningful to you, they can relate to it in their own experience, and naturally they are moved to respond. But if you make it just a matter of 'me against you', a case of who gets to have their way, then for sure there will be resistance and lack of care.</p>
<p>(B) Consider also why what you see as interruptions happen. Are they malicious â€” is someone needing more attention from you; is someone feeling left out or jealous or in some way afraid of what you're doing? Are they accidental, because someone needs to get something out of the room, or doesn't know that you're hoping for privacy? When you consider the other side you may come up with solutions.</p>
<p>In addition, you can look at ways to avoid the situation, like getting up earlier than the rest of your family to do your practice. I'm not saying that you have to be the only one to change; but if nothing else is changing and you want a certain result, then you may have to be the one.</p>
<p>(C) To the meditative mind, nothing is a problem. This is maybe difficult for a beginner to accept, because a beginner's mind still has a lot of attaching habit: outside events still tend to pull the mind here and there. But that being pulled here and there is not meditation. Meditation means 'no problem'. Anything appears: <em>no problem</em>. Anything remains: <em>no problem</em>. Anything goes away: <em>no problem</em>. Your job is only the method, that is all.</p>
<p>To the meditative mind, even death is no problem. Only thinking makes problems. Less thinking, less problem. No thinking, no problem.</p>
<p>So although the other steps are important in terms of your relationship with your family, in terms of your own mind and meditative practice you don't need to attach to them. It is absolutely <em>not</em> inevitable that you get angry when you don't get your way. You don't need to let your mind be controlled like that. Only return to the method.</p>
<p>But that is not to say that anger is bad or that you are not allowed to be angry. Anger is a sign that some boundary has been overstepped, that some real or perceived injustice is being done. So when anger appears, you can look for its cause: what boundary needs to be respected, and how can I communicate that in a clear and caring way? How can I show respect as much as I require it from others?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you display the good effects of meditation, others will take it more seriously. When you act with more clarity, enthusiasm, care, flexibility, and patience, your family members will take notice and realize that it's a good thing. But if you lash out about this weird new thing you're doing they're likely to resent it and think that you're being hypocritical. It's definitely quite a responsibility to not only face your own tumultuous mind in meditation but also bear with the tumultuous events in your family; but practicing patience and harmony is what will help transform others. People don't care what you say; they care what you do.</p>
<p>If it is hard, let folks know "Hey, this is hard for me. I'm trying to help myself and become a better member of this family; but I need some help."</p>
