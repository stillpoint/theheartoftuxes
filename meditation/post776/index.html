  <h1>Meditated for an hour- felt worse. Is this normal?</h1>

<p>To be precise, let's not talk about <em>normal</em> or <em>abnormal</em>; because the original, normal mind is at complete peace, and what we work with most of the time is a skewed and hobbled version. We can say that this is <em>common</em>.</p>
<p>We all have habits of avoidance; some of us more so, some of us less. We all tend to grasp at pleasant things and run away from unpleasant things and ignore neutral things; this makes the karma that controls us. Your avoiding habit is strong enough that you turn to drugs to help you avoid. In addition, the chemical effect of the drugs will augment the avoiding habit. (This is not a moralistic statement, but just noting cause and effect with respect to your mind states.)</p>
<p>It is wonderful that you are willing to look into practice and improve your relationship with reality. But right now your capacity to stay real is not so strong. When something uncomfortable arises your habit moves away strongly. While it is important to eventually shed this habit that controls you, it's necessary to be skillful in how you do it.</p>
<p>You say that you feel (almost) as if you did too much at once. That's possible; and if that's the case you may need to find a way to taper in. Some Zen Centers require people to work up to 20, 30, or 40 minutes of sitting on their own before they participate in group sittings at the center. So there's homework you can do in preparation.</p>
<p>Many centers also offer introductory or alternative programs so you can get some guidance without  all of a sudden 'diving into the deep end'. I strongly urge you to keep in touch with the Zendo, and with the teachers and experienced practitioners there. Nearly all dedicated practitioners have gone through or will go through very similar territory; and their experience can inform and encourage you. Talk about your experience with the leader of the sitting or with a teacher at the Zendo.</p>
<p>Some Zendos are 'hard style', which works for many people. Others are 'easy style', which also works for many people. Easy style doesn't mean lax; it means you don't push — you practice the rigorous discipline of being present without pushing. Take in the wisdom of your teachers, but also understand its context, what kind of tradition and view it's coming from. That way you can get a better sense of whether the path might work well for you. In your life, do you need hard style or easy style? Do you need boundaries held for you; do you respond well to a challenge? Or do you need softer support; do you shut down when challenged? Eventually through training you achieve independence, but you can be wise about choosing your approach.</p>
<p>One very critical point for you, and for all newcomers, is to understand that success in meditation is not measured by good feeling. Just because you felt like leaving doesn't mean your experience was wrong! In fact it may be a good sign, that you came close to truths that haven't been well attended to outside of meditation. Meditation must be free of what Shunryu Suzuki Roshi called 'a gaining attitude'. Your proper aim is not to manipulate your feelings or force a certain state of mind to appear, but rather to practice showing up open-handedly. Your showing-up practice means that for a period of time you devote yourself to plain reality, thus you build your ability to be with reality rather than be controlled by your opinions and preferences. (That's <em>one</em> function of meditation. Another function is that you develop insight into the very nature of reality.)</p>
<p>Open-handed practice means when there's peace, you see there's peace; and when there's agitation, you see there's agitation. You don't mess with it, you watch it all. Sometimes the sky is clear blue; sometimes it's almost black with storm clouds; sometimes fog rolls in: it's all just weather, changing, changing, changing. This is how you watch your mind, just like seeing different skies changing, changing.</p>
<p>So these actions are to be avoided in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid focusing on result. Only do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid checking or judging your practice. In this case, avoid checking or judging your practice based on how you feel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice isn't always 'nicey-nicey'. But as I wrote above, we look for skillful approaches. If you only ever experience pain and the feeling that it's all too much to handle, that could drive you away from practice altogether. Certainly we don't want that; a balance is necessary, neither too loose nor too tight. Some amount of comfort, good feeling, and positive results in your life help you continue practicing with the right attitude. Although you don't key on results when doing meditation, from time to time outside of meditation you should note whether the effects have been positive or negative.</p>
<p>There are specific practices to help with heartache, and there are specific practices to help with patterns of emotional avoidance. Some of these practices are available within some Zen schools. Chanting, for instance, is healing for the heart. When you chant you use your speech in a positive, purifying way; and your mind and breathing align with it. You can chant with any emotion — it can all go into the chant to empower your involvement.</p>
<p>Other practices offer structures that guide you to your heart in compassionate, non-confrontational ways. In some cases, when emotion is overwhelming, this has to be addressed first before true open-handed practice can proceed. For example, <em>Metta</em> and <em>Tonglen</em> practices are by nature healing for the heart, and help you find stability and balance while being with feelings. These, then, are two possible cures for your strong pattern of avoidance.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As Sri Ramana Maharshi taught, it is right that these (difficult and dark) things come to light; it is necessary, so they can move out. If you don't experience difficulty consciously it will stay within you unconsciously, and control your life, and keep regenerating cycles of suffering. So "if you're going through hell, <em>keep going</em>!"</p>
