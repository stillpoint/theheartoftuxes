  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>Also yesterday you said to have a blank slate after every situation</em></p>
<p>Where did I say that?</p>
<p>Please be careful and meticulous about language. "Let go" does not equal "blank state".</p>
<p>Once, I was sitting outside in the sun and a butterfly landed on my shoulder. I didn't try to catch it as some people do; I let it go. But it stayed on my shoulder. A while later it circled around me and landed again and rested with me. Finally, after some time, it flitted off into the distance.</p>
<p>So letting go doesn't necessarily mean that things disappear. It means you don't grasp them. When you let go of thinking, it means that you just don't follow it. You keep your center; and when thinking appears, you let it be, like a butterfly flitting nearby or even resting with you. You just don't follow and follow and follow.</p>
<p>Is that clear?</p>
<p>Occasionally you may be 'butterfly-free' â€” you may go through a few moments or seconds without thought. That's not insignificant, but it's part of the scene that keeps changing. If you attach to no-thoughts by trying to hold onto it or force it to happen, you lose your center. If you attach to thoughts by trying to avoid or destroy them, or by following them along lines of thinking, you lose your center. Just keep the mind that doesn't move, regardless of the scene that appears.</p>
<p>So yes, you <em>reset</em> after every situation; but you don't try to manipulate your mind into any particular state. It is more simple than that, more openhanded. Relax and participate with what's happening.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>At first I thing I turned to this because I want to be the best person I can and help people, I've always been that way and I realized that I was a really unbalanced person and I was sometimes a person who I wouldn't like. I feel as if my thought process is improving from meditation which I love and will make me want to continue to meditate.</em></p>
<p>That is wonderful that you are finding your balance and cultivating your character. <em>Also</em>, originally you are already okay. When you return to your center by letting everything be, what you are is already good and complete.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Haha my thoughts are pretty scattered, sorry.</em></p>
<p>No problem. At the beginning, things are vague and indistinct. A cloud that has not yet gathered doesn't have distinguishable boundaries. It's the nature of the phase, and it's appropriate that you're just getting to know what's out there and how things are moving in you.</p>
<p>&gt;I really look to Buddha and what he did in life, how he lived life and I would like to be that way too. Also I don't like American culture and how were isolated and don't open up. I want to learn about as many people as possible and love as many people as possible.</p>
<p>'Buddha' is you and me. Very good story.</p>
<p>I also don't like parts of American culture. But some things I like very much. We are disconnected and arrogant and lack many freedoms; but we also have <em>tremendous</em> benefits, access to many teachings and many cultures, and the freedom and leisure to decide what to believe and how to pursue our beliefs. There are many very, very precious blessings to living in America.</p>
<p>And the parts that we don't like are also necessary. They come about by cause and effect; we create the good and bad parts together. And so it is necessary for us to experience those parts and wake up to them, so we can end that karma.</p>
<p>When our center is strong, we can be in America and live American-style, but we can help people rather than be tossed about by what we want and what we don't have. When our center is not strong, we may need to find a controlled practice environment in order to keep being turned back to practice, back to our center.</p>
<p>&gt;Also, do you think I could come to you whenever I have any questions or doubts I stumble upon?</p>
<p>No problem. If I'm around I'll try to reply. If I'm away for some time, don't take it personally.</p>

<p>My suggestion for you is Pema Chodron's book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Meditate-Practical-Making-Friends/dp/1604079339"><em>How To Meditate: A Practical Guide To Making Friends With Your Mind</em>.</a> It's available in hardcover, e-book, and audio CD.</p>
