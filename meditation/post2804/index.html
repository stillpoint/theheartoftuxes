  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The problem with trying to be your own guide along the spiritual path is that the deeply habitual, attached, ignorant, tainted, obscured mind -- the mind you're trying to cure or shed -- is the one placed in the role of the guide. Before you consider this, it seems reasonable to use your best reasoning; but once you consider it, the ridiculousness becomes apparent. It's like installing a buffoon as leader of your nation.</p>
<p>When you don't have a proper, reliable, always-clear, always-compassionate guide along the path, you are forced to play the role of both innocent seeker and knowing master. And the opportunity to rest in innocence and let it do its important work is undercut.</p>
<p>People think that more knowledge will allay their fear; but it's usually the case that more knowledge (more concept) only adds fuel to the speculating, arranging, dreaming mind habit. One doesn't notice it, because it's the way one always uses one's mind. The new way of using the mind had not yet been learned, much less trusted.</p>
<p>But this innocence is all-important and all-protective. If you don't make or attach to anything with your mind, nothing can harm it. It's the making and attaching that leave you (the one who makes and attaches) vulnerable.</p>
<p><em>Right</em> knowledge is necessary&lt; knowledge of this real scene where you're standing right now.</p>
<p>The ego's making/attaching habit considers views and concepts its treasure. More to hold! More to manipulate! This creates a false confidence, that the more ideas one has the safer one is.</p>
<p>So the availability of all spiritual technologies online at one's fingertips -- and the availability of all conversations and all levels of teaching (all true teaching, not to mention the thousand-fold greater presence of <em>wrong</em> teaching) -- seems to the ego's manipulating mind to be a great treasure, a great opportunity. </p>
<p>Thus, people get everything out of order and mixed up inappropriately. The ignorant mind is the one rifling through the online files, deciding what to hang onto. Absolute concepts are clung to before one even has developed the ability to ground oneself in plain reality. Advanced concepts are bandied about before one has even had a taste of authentic practice. All these things are coming at the wrong time.</p>
<p>There <em>may</em> be a time for the 'dark night of the soul'; but if there is, it will come because one has made certain effort and progress in authentic practice. And, having made that effort and progress, one is armed with the tools one needs to face and travel through that territory. And hopefully, one will also have gathered the conditions supportive of authentic practice: true teacher, practice group or community, practice space and schedule, gradually increasing commitments and vows that provide direction and keep one on the right path, balanced lifestyle dynamics (right eating, working, resting, physical activity, and sleeping), and many other big and small supports that help the mind and heart to be clear and quickly digest difficulty.</p>
<p>That is one of the many, many reasons why a proper course of training, in proper order, from a proper, attained and verified teacher is so significant.</p>
<p>Have you seen how cats make themselves scared? They make a ball of paper into a fierce enemy, and play fight with it. Then the play-fighting grows in intensity until the energy and mood overtakes them, and they freak out. Some cats do this. Or they seem to see or imagine things that aren't there or that we can't see, and they get worked up about it.</p>
<p>Don't be like a cat in that way. Don't make imaginary scenarios into your enemy. You haven't even found your feet yet. <strong><em>Where are your feet standing? What is in front of your face?</em></strong> This is the arena of your practice: real life.</p>
<p>If you make a problem, you have a problem.</p>
<p>It is the clinging, attaching, manipulating mind of the ego that whips itself into a frenzied fear. Yes, of course, if you cling to that mind strongly you can go insane. So don't cling to that mind. But you need a proper guide to point that out to you. Otherwise, the habit is to think that clinging, attaching, and manipulating are right practice -- that <em>you</em> can figure out the way, if only you get more tools, more ideas, more techniques, more tips.</p>
<p>Actually, the ego has a vested interest in the fear. When you make a drama in your head, the ego is very happy: it gets to <em>be</em> something! It gets to be the victim or hero, the great master or the threatened little speck in a dangerous universe -- whatever the role of the day happens to be. Meditation means <em>not</em> playing a role. Just be real; not be a <em>something</em>. The ego hates that, and thus loves the drama implicit in talk of the 'dark night'. The bigger the drama, the better, add far as ego is concerned.</p>
<p>If you let go of imagining and find a proper guide, you can do proper practice and digest your life. Then the so-called dark night has its correct function; and that function can be intuited even as you go through it: to purify the illusion that has beset you for so long. Even if there is discomfort, there may also be a great devotion, a great will behind that. Just as the hard times in a loving relationship bring you closer to each other, the hard times in a true practice relationship bring you closer to yourself and all others.</p>
