  <h1>Why are insights so elusive?</h1>

<p>Don't be hasty! Cultivate your perseverance, your zeal and effort, your patience. Do you think the Buddha got enlightenment just by hearing a teaching and doing a couple of days of meditation? It's not some magic pill that you take; you have to extricate your consciousness from the habits and delusions that you've built up over years and lifetimes. So this means using every part of your life to support your quest for insight.</p>
<p>True practitioners make very sincere, dedicated effort moment to moment, day to day, for many years (and lifetimes) to reach true insight. This is the real deal; it's not like finishing a book and saying "now I've got it!"</p>
<p>First you hear the teaching, then it works on you. You find out how it fits in with the way you see things, and either reject it or start to shift your way of seeing. It doesn't happen all at once; the self-image (which folks sometimes call 'ego') is very invested in keeping its way of seeing things; it feels like a matter of life and death to the self-image. So habits have to be dismantled, ways of life come into question and are revolutionized, stubborn blind spots are worked with again and again and again â€” it's a long road on the way to realization. You fall down and pick yourself up countless times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have to keep going, and not backslide. Chaos will happen automatically, but order, including the re-ordering of your understanding, requires your consistent watchfulness.</p>
<p>When your ethical conduct, strength of character, good relationships, balanced health, and grounded lifestyle all support your clarity of mind, and when your meditation is correct and consistent, then you will have some experience confirming the teaching. You may understand something, or you may not understand it at first. Usually you will understand something and then be shown that you don't understand completely, so more practice will be necessary.</p>
<p>This process of refining your conception takes both time and effort. But if you let your mind wander to the imagined future or to thoughts about how far you've progressed and how far you have to go, you will surely become despondent and lazy. So it's not your job to check your progress. You just continue sincerely. Maybe you have a teacher who can check you; but either way, you have to just continue sincerely, not thinking of time or result. That is your right relationship.</p>
<p>When you reach the point where you know that you need this insight, this realization, and that nothing else in life will substitute for it, then you will be ready to offer yourself to the path of realization. It becomes easier then, because your whole life becomes practice. There is no longer such a goal-oriented desperation to get something, and the subsequent feelings of impatience and failure. Such thoughts may pop up from time to time, but if you give yourself over all you have to know is that you are doing your best, moment to moment.</p>
<p>So yes, it is like you say. Just forget about it and be mindful/meditative through the days/months/years until it finaly clicks, out of nowhere. Yes.</p>
<p>But then, it won't matter so much whether it clicks, or when, or what the click will be. It won't matter so much, because your whole life will be an expression of the realization already. Giving yourself to mindful, open presence from moment to moment already expresses whatever realization you may be after. You life a life of enlightenment without knowing it.</p>
<p>Some people get realization by putting great pressure on themselves; but then they may not know what to do with it, how to live, how to make up the difference between what they have seen and what their human, habitual patterns are.</p>
<p>Others follow a sincere direction, only offering themselves to what faces them, and whether they have a realization or not their life shines to all others. If they have a realization, they can use it well.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you practice <em>shamatha/vipassana</em> correctly and consistently, you will get a direct experience of impermanence.</p>
<p>In vipassana meditation you will see that the phenomena that arise within your circle of attention are all changing: sensations arise and continue and pass, and even their continuing is constantly changing. You will feel the buzzing or bubbling or pulsing or other qualities of the sensations, and you will be able to see that they are all in movement. You don't have to look for a realization; you will see, and then the realization will come.</p>
<p>In shamatha meditation you will unify with the object of concentration; your attention will merge with the object. That is also direct experience, although you won't yet have a realization about it until you come out of it. Again, there's no need to think any idea; the realization will come from having had the experience.</p>
<p>If you want to do analytical thinking-style practice, that is okay too. There are several kinds of practices recommended for understanding impermanence, including death meditations. The 9-point meditation (really a remembrance or analysis) on death is quite popular, as is the death visualization that goes through the process of dying and death element by element.</p>
<p>But vipassana practice gives you a direct experience of the changing of phenomena, and in particular the changing of phenomena that you usually take to be your self.</p>
