  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>If you have problems being present with emotions, as many people do, meditation may not be your first or best approach. Therapeutic process may be more helpful before, or in addition to, meditation. As well, there are many practices that specifically help to befriend and integrate emotions.</p>
<p>Physical practice is helpful for many reasons, including grounding (providing a home for the heart) and flow, and in the case of expressive movement a medium of infinite adaptability. Art and art therapy, writing and journaling might likewise be very beneficial pursuits for you.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what connection Kabat Zinn's methods have with Tibetan practice. In Tantra, one field of Vajrayana Buddhism, the entire development of the broad and lush practice is built on the basis of transforming negative emotions and qualities into wisdom. So it is not just one method <em>per se</em>, but an entire field, a whole course of life practice that addresses this issue.</p>
<p>In Tantra, all formations are seen as having the nature of awakening; so whereas the old Sutra school focuses on following rules of conduct to gradually purify negativity, Tantra can quickly turn negative emotions around to their positive expression. This kind of practice has to be undertaken with a lama (a guru — a lineage master who can pass down the teachings and empowerments).</p>
<p>In general, yes, the application of space is essential. Your innate spacious mind is relied upon, and all negativity is liberated within that space. But there are several problems with trying to achieve it on your own:</p>
<p>First, can you identify and wield your spacious mind? Almost everyone needs to have it pointed out, both the mind itself and the way to call it up. Almost everyone needs to have it acknowledged repeatedly so as to avoid mistaking it or doubting it.</p>
<p>Second, the will to apply it is hard to come by. Often only suffering motivates us sufficiently, which makes for a very up-and-down, sporadic practice.</p>
<p>Third, when we are in the grip of negativity it can be nigh impossible to do the practice, to return to spaciousness. Until we have internalized the perspective beyond our emotional situation it is difficult to act beyond it.</p>
<p>For these reasons, and others, stable and reliable external supports are usually necessary — and much more so when emotional difficulty is an issue. A teacher who can always hold the stable, unconditional view for you, and who can always provide appropriate teachings and reflections, is invaluable. A practice setting, course, and group also provide the stability and continuity that one has difficulty maintaining on one's own. And in the case of upheaval and turmoil, the proper mentors, counselors, doctors, and therapists also provide resources that we would almost certainly lack on our own.</p>
<p>'White knuckly ride' suggests a relationship of opposition. From the very beginning, it seems, there is some kind of antagonistic or non-accepting attitude. A programming, a conditioning has been etched into one's mind that certain emotions or emotionality in general are wrong, inferior, dangerous, harmful, etc. The egoic sense of self that always seeks control may be fearful of the unpredictability and ungraspability of emotion; <em>or</em> it may turn emotion into an ego-boosting force by creating dramas. Correct meditation starts from completion: you are already okay. Anything that arises in you is already okay. No need to kill it, avoid it, manipulate it, embellish it, or ignore it. One only remains still while the world swirls up and down around the center.</p>
<p>Body, breath, and mind condition each other. These common meditation instructions support you in maintaining your still center amid turmoil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relaxing the body, letting it find its stillness in awake posture.</li>
<li>Relaxing the breath, letting it become smooth and natural.</li>
<li>Slightly deepening the breath, letting it sink into the belly.</li>
<li>Letting the exhalation be longer than the inhalation, but within a relaxed and natural rhythm.</li>
<li>Welcoming all sensations, thoughts, images, feelings, and experiences, in the faith that you are already complete and your spacious mind is not harmed by anything that passes through it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spacious mind is like sky. The birds that fly through the sky don't harm it. Even an enormous murmuration of starlings doesn't mark the sky. Even massive thunderstorms don't disturb the space of the sky. So you sit in faith in your sky nature, allowing all formations to pass through.</p>
<p>One thing you can do to connect with your sky nature is to gaze at the sky. This is actually a very good practice, which can help you remember your spaciousness. Look at the sky, and take that spaciousness into yourself and realize it is your most basic being.</p>
<p>Outside of therapy, of all practices for integrating emotion I can recommend none more highly than free dance. It is the best I've encountered at bringing all aspects of being together in unity: body, heart, mind, spirit, uniqueness, relationship, and world — all can be worked with directly through free movement. Getting into the body, you can connect with your own intuition: the bodymind will show you how it needs to move in order to heal itself. And the space you provide yourself in dance directly translates to spaciousness in life. All forms, all energies are viable; all can be made into art, into truth. Spontaneously, in the moment. And then it is also very clean: once the dance is finished, it is gone; it disappears as you do it. If you want suggestions for free dance/movement methods, let me know and I'll make recommendations.</p>
