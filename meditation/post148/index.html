  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's relative. It can get far more intense than that.</p>
<p>Why do it? That is the main point. If you are doing it to have temporarily better feeling, then yes it's probably not for you. But the teaching of Vipassana is that all phenomena are temporary, and there's nothing to hold onto. You can't always get your favorite; you can't always get better feeling. So how are you with <em>that</em>? Are you okay with it â€” can you still be happy when you don't get your favorite situation?</p>
<p>The intensity is meant to bring you face to face with this basic issue of life so you can develop equanimity, the ability to show up openhanded no matter what the situation brings. This is what reveals both your happiness and your compassion. Your relationship with life deepens, from always chasing an impossible ideal to being at peace with things-as-they-are.</p>
<p>If there were no discomfort in the training, you couldn't attain this lesson. But since everything is impermanent, sometimes the training will be very comfortable too, and sometimes neutral. Along the way you will learn how to deal with discomfort, how to relax yourself, how to center your mind so its peace is not disturbed by discomfort, how to find the part of you that is profoundly joyful and in love with the world regardless of the outer coming-and-going situation.</p>
<p>So as I say, the main point is <em>why</em> do retreat. If it is only to get something for yourself, you will suffer. No situation will ever be satisfactory. But if you approach retreat with higher aspiration, to connect with your joyful awakened nature for the sake of others, discomfort will get transformed into awakening through your aspiration and practice.</p>
<p>It is common to have fear about taking on practice commitments. Very common! I'm certainly very familiar with the feeling of stepping into something intense or impossible in practice. I would like to share a wonderful teaching about that, which will be useful throughout your meditation career: <strong>Problem comes from thinking.</strong></p>
<p>You have this trepidation because you are thinking. And any discomfort that may appear â€” in your daily life, or in retreat â€” is multiplied by your thinking. But if you are not thinking, your mind is momentary, and you can handle anything. The trick is to limit your attention. If it is something worth doing, do it. Then limit your attention to the task at hand.</p>
<p>If you think of the whole ten days, certainly it can seem like "<em>Wow</em>, I don't know if I can do that!" But your thinking is creating a lie. You are not even in retreat yet, but already you are fabricating images of discomfort and difficulty, and you are judging situations that are not even happening and may never happen. You haven't done it yet, so you don't know what will happen or how you will take to it. But what you <em>can</em> know is that your thinking makes a problem.</p>
<p>If you then consider only one day or one hour of practice, you may think "Yes, I could do that." You may even have the sense that you want to try. Keep narrowing the time, keep limiting your attention. What about one minute, can you handle that? What about one second of retreat?</p>
<p>Even one second is sometimes too much to handle; so you have to limit your attention further. Only be alive. Only participate in the moment. Take care of the moment, and the entire retreat or whatever situation you are facing will soon pass; because that is the nature of things: to pass.</p>
<p>Luckily, Vipassana retreat trains you in being momentary. So if you follow your training and only take care of the moment, everything will be no problem. You will only have to handle a timeless moment at a time â€” not ten days! Only your thinking makes 'ten days'; that's the only place where 'ten days' appears. So if you start to feel the ominous, looming weight of time, you can know that your thinking is making that problem, and you can return to being momentary.</p>
<p>The true beginner's mind is indeed momentary. Look at a baby's eyes, and you will receive this teaching in being momentary. When you are momentary, participating rather than thinking, you are actually alive. When you are in time, which is an illusion made by your thinking, you are actually living a ghost life.</p>
<p>You don't have to do the retreat if you feel it's not for you or if you don't feel ready yet. When your aspiration is big you can push; as practice grows at some point you will naturally feel like taking on more, moving out beyond your previous limits. But when your practice is still like a seedling it needs some care and protection. </p>
<p>But whether you are in retreat or out, you can use this lesson. Thinking makes problem. Let go of thinking and return to the moment, which is your true life.</p>
