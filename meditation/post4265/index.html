  <h1>I was meditating tonight and just taught myself how to breath from my abdominal muscles because I never understood it before. MIND BLOWN!</h1>

<p>First I want to say how moved I am by your wonderful comment and your willingness to take care and help others even while you're exploring things for yourself. I have such respect for that!</p>
<p>We will make mistakes, all of us; but if we have the humility and sincerity that you display we will be able to correct them quickly, let go, and move on cleanly.</p>
<p>About your question: do you understand what I mean by correct relationship, in meditation and in life?</p>
<p>That is the main point. It is not applied from the outside, from a set of rules or something an authority tells us to do, or even from our own idea. Integrity is already there; we just need to get out of the way. So we practice letting go of our ideas and attempts at controlling the situation.</p>
<p>Meditation is the same practice: return to the method purely, without trying to make something happen; when thinking arises, let it go and return to the method. The approach is the same as if you were carrying a pillow or a hackysack or backpack full of clothing: you just drop it. Nothing special, just opening the hands and dropping. I really do recommend trying this many times to get that meaning in your body. Find something that will just <em>plop</em> when you drop it, and practice letting it go. Let it go simply, without preparation, without hesitation, without making a fuss.</p>
<p>In meditation or in daily life, it's the same. The tension in the body can be let go, the opinion or desire in the thinking can be let go, the problem stretching out ahead of us can be let go. We just need to do it repeatedly.</p>
<p>The thing we're letting go of will not necessarily go away immediately, or for a while. That's not our concern. Our concern is with the purity of letting go just now.</p>
<p>If we think of how much we have to let go of or how to do it, we may get discouraged. So again, that is not our concern. We only do it purely, this moment.</p>
<p>If you learn to limit your activity to a single moment, then you can meet any difficulty; and also you can live your life deeply — you can really be there with your activities, with other people or animals or the scene around you. Fixing a lifetime is very difficult. Dealing with a week or a day full of crap is very difficult. Sometimes even a minute or a second is too long to handle. But you always have the power to let go in the moment.</p>
<p>In terms of specific recommendations, first it's important to respect your teacher and tradition. Even if you do not have an in-person teacher and are only learning from a book, it's important to offer your attention and curiosity to that fully. I don't mean that you have to do what your teacher says, but you should be willing to look into it without distraction. Then you will find out for yourself what your next moves should be.</p>
<p>So I don't want to give you instruction about breathing that might get in the way of what you're already studying. I encourage you to look deeper into the tradition or school or course of training that you've chosen, and see what guidance there is about practicing with breathing.</p>
<p>If you haven't committed to one course of training, then I can offer my experience and opinions as a student of meditation; but I won't be able to guide you closely, especially on something as subtle and changeable as breathing, and anyway you should check for yourself how any instructions align with your own sense of things and your direction in life.</p>
<p>If it doesn't interfere with your course of study, I can say this: Since you find benefit in a specific form of breathing — it serves as a kind of remedy for the previous blockage — I might suggest splitting your meditation time into two segments. Arrange the segments for whatever duration you feel is appropriate, but let the durations be clear; that is, assign a number of minutes to each and don't deviate. This will eliminate some of the tendency to manipulate.</p>
<p>Let one segment be devoted to practicing the regulated breath, and let the other segment be devoted to letting go of the whole issue of breathing altogether. If you're counting your breath, then focus on the number; if you're following your breath, then be very meticulous about not controlling your breathing; if you have some other object of meditation, then fix upon that object and never mind about the breath — let it do its own thing.</p>
<p>At first, engagement with the breath may be distracting; but that is not failure, it's just a common phase to pass through. It just means that you will have to let-go-and-return more often. No problem. You're already going to let go and return a million billion times, right? So the level of distraction doesn't matter. Only let go and return purely. Your ability will grow, your center will become stronger, and your direction will be gradually realized.</p>
