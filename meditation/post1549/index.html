  <h1>Has anyone have a total control on their $exual energy? What helped you get this raging fire under control?</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>Sometimes the sexual thoughts becomes so intense that I lose control over myself. I do meditate a lot to calm myself down but sometimes that doesn't work.</em></p>
<p>That's okay. This is the natural process of patterns that you've been born with or have developed through your life. Some of it is part of being human and having a human body and consciousness. Some of it is the buildup of attachments and the presence of wounds that have not yet healed. Everyone has something like this; if it's not sex, it's something else, but everyone has this kind of process going on in their lives.</p>
<p>The Five Cravings (or Five Greedy Desires) are the desires for sleeping, eating, sex, wealth, and fame. These are the persistent attachments that cloud our lives. It is taught that a good cure for greedy desire is generosity. You can always be generous; it doesn't depend on money or possessions. Generous with your time or effort, generous helping in small ways, generous in offering kindness to loved ones or strangers. You can offer a bit more attention to each person you meet. You can offer a bit more kindhearted smile or inner good wishes. You can offer a bit more space or letting-be. Infinite ways to be generous.</p>
<p>At first the connection between generosity and craving may seem strange or arbitrary, but if you consider it you might see the sense in it. What we do and what we are all comes from our thinking; and what we think of ourselves shapes our behavior and the results of our behavior that become the trappings of our life. From the center comes the whole unfolding situation.</p>
<p>When we think of ourselves as needy, shameful, weak, out of control, or in general missing something essential, then of course we will seek things to fill in those perceived faults. The needing and the seeking become a cycle, each creating the other.</p>
<p>When we think of ourselves as fulfilled, complete, noble, self-possessed, and lacking nothing, then we are not driven to fill or cover parts of our being. We can be content within the ups and downs of life. But these kinds of thoughts don't appear just because we want to think them. The thoughts in our hearts come from our true intentions and actions. So behaving like someone who has enough — who <em>is</em> enough — is necessary, to overturn that false sense of lack.</p>
<p>Meditation should not bear the whole burden of life. Meditation addresses what meditation can address; lifestyle changes and actions address what meditation cannot (or should not).</p>
<p>Meditation should also not be wielded as a weapon against part of the mind. Pitting one part of your being against another just builds up the tension and pressure that become overwhelming. Take every opportunity to befriend all parts of yourself. Take care not to polarize the situation, not to make anything into the "problem" or "enemy".</p>
<p>There are various strategies and therapeutic programs for dealing with addictions. These can work in concert with meditation; but don't sit down to meditation with the thought that you're going to fix yourself. That is starting from an assumption of weakness. Sit down to meditation as the noble one; sit down as the whole, complete world. Whatever thoughts, emotions, and sensations appear — even if they appear in association and seem to be part of a pattern — are truth. They are expressions of the momentary world of truth. They don't mean anything other than what they are.</p>
<p>One very helpful skill is skill in dropping a thing and turning to something else. The ability to say "not now... maybe later." You can practice it with little, random things, like putting down the jam when you're about to spread it on your toast, and going for honey instead. </p>
<p>You can also practice it as cleanly letting go when a situation changes: you think the weather is going to be a certain way as you step outside, but it's something else, so you just immediately and without a second thought go back inside and get the appropriate jacket or whatever.</p>
<p>And you can practice it when you get caught up in a theme that threatens to take control of you. One of the common dynamics in addiction is the sort of trance one gets into, as if power has been given over to the trend of thoughts and actions. You can break the trance. It may come back, but you can break it; and as long as you are safe in the moment, you are safe. Just immediately, without planning or struggling at all, change your posture, step away, do the next thing, or dive into something completely different. This is essentially the same skill or knack in mediation, of dropping trains of thought without making a fuss. You just return instantly to the method. Outside of meditation, you can just turn instantly to another action: go for a walk... walk backwards... drink water... call a friend.... You don't even have to decide what to do; your spontaneous action will decide if you let it.</p>
<p>This, clearly, will help when you get caught up in a stream of sexual thinking. The moment you notice it, drop it instantly. It is not a fight for dominance; it is nothing — light as a feather.</p>
<p>Our patterns will return to us. This is cause and effect. It is natural. It doesn't mean they have control over us, nor that they will never disappear. It's just not for us to predict the time and means of their passing. It's for us to drop it all in an instant, and to do that again and again, ten thousand times.</p>
