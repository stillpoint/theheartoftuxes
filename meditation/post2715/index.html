  <h1>Does depression go away?</h1>

<p>There are <strong>several possible causes</strong> of depression, not all of which can be addressed by meditation. If your depression is a result of hormonal imbalance or disease, you need to get that taken care of through other means. Consult the appropriate health professionals.</p>
<p>On a purely emotional level, depression is stuck energy. It's <strong>emotional energy that neither moves inward nor outward</strong>. Quite often there is an associated emotional wound or dysfunctional pattern of relating that has caused the person to retreat from things that could mean more potential wounding or discomfort — feelings, new encounters, new situations, the world at large. Sometimes addictive behavior enters the picture as an attempt to controlling feeling and avoid the free and unpredictable movement of life.</p>
<p>But life moves. Vital energy moves. If one's movement — emotional, psychic, physical, or relational movement — becomes limited one can become tired and listless, feeling not only bored but also too weak to face situations or try things that could help oneself.</p>
<p>This tends to appear as a pattern of <strong>fearing or avoiding certain emotional feelings and expressions</strong>, and may appear in behavior as avoiding certain interactions and life experiences. <strong>Emotional therapies</strong> can be helpful where one can't even bring oneself to meditate or face one's inner life by oneself. In this case, you may want to consult a psychotherapist or counsellor to get some support.</p>
<p>There is a vicious cycle in depression of shutting down, which leads to stagnant energy (no flow in life) and feelings of weakness, which further disheartens the person and discourages him from venturing out with the emotions or activity. As I said above, if the original cause is hormonal or otherwise physiological then that should be addressed by a doctor or other appropriate health professional; but it is usually the case that <strong>a depressed person can at least improve his/her situation anyway</strong>. There are many tools and strategies out there, but two come to mind here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Feel, rather than think</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since depression tends to involve a shutting down or avoidance of feelings (either specific feelings or <em>all</em> feeling), turning around depression means becoming friends again with these natural inner movements. Fear, anger, and sadness no longer have to be seen as enemies that are either vanquished or evaded, but rather as your own life energy appearing naturally in different forms. This is something like the willingness to go out in all kinds of weather, and to be okay with it. Sunny is sunny; cloudy is cloudy; rainy is rainy; windy is windy — all are valid, and all are beautiful in their own way. Likewise, <strong>all of the things that arise in you are valid, meaningful, and beautiful in their own way</strong>.</p>
<p>When it's time to cry, let it out and cry. When it's time to be angry, express your anger skillfully, but do express it. Let the thing appear, then you can move on. If you don't let it appear, you can't move on, and that stuckness will suck life out of you.</p>
<p><strong>Turning around the habit of avoiding</strong> brings about a new relationship with your inner life. But this has to be intentional. The strong habit is to avoid, so <strong>the intent to <em>be with</em> the inner life has to be applied repeatedly and frequently</strong>. (This is one of the benefits of meditation: it is an intentional embrace of what's really going on.)</p>
<p>If the depressed person can't find the wherewithal to embrace the inner life (perhaps not even knowing how to start), the support of a guide experienced in emotional process can be very useful. There are many kinds of therapies available. (It may be necessary to do some research and try a few different kinds before finding one that works well for the person.)</p>
<p>The foremost way we avoid reality is through thinking. If you are troubled by depression, it can be very helpful to <strong>bring awareness to the ways that your thinking brings you down</strong>, and to <strong>find ways to disengage</strong> from those trains of thought. It can also be helpful to understand the difference between thinking and feeling. We tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater, seeking to escape negativity or discomfort altogether; but it's really what we <em>think</em> about our situation that is the problem; the events and feelings themselves are simply life unfolding. We need to make friends with that unfolding.</p>
<p>The <em>thinking</em> part of depression usually has a tremendous influence on the person, but it's also a part that you can learn to handle better. Letting go of depressive trains of thought is a skill you can learn; it can be practiced and developed through <strong>meditation methods</strong>, for instance. The problem for many people is that the thinking is so strong, when they sit down to meditate they just become even more wrapped up in thinking and fighting with their thinking minds.</p>
<p><strong>Physical movement</strong> is a very good medicine for this kind of situation. You don't need to do sitting-style meditations where you're up in the head; you can do <strong>moving meditations</strong> like Yoga or Tai Ji or bowing practice. You can also get out of the head and into the body just by being <strong>physically active in sports</strong> that you enjoy, whether they're group or partner sports, solo efforts like running or swimming or cycling, or even <strong>unstructured play</strong> like frisbee, hackysack, or romping around with dogs.</p>
<p>All of these activities can help break the vicious cycle of depressive thinking. But they have other benefits for depression as well: they get the energy moving, allow you to express yourself unreservedly (changing the pattern of holding back expression), and induce the production of "happy" hormones like endorphins.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best activity for depression is <strong>free dance</strong>. It has all of the benefits of the above categories of activities, but it also is unique in how it can embrace and express <em>any</em> emotion or internal situation that arises. Fear, anger, love, frustration, joy, sadness, suspicion, grief, compassion, pain.... anything that arises in you can be expressed in free dance. And if it can be expressed, it can be healed. It is the movement of the situation that is key — getting unstuck, out of the rut, out of the cage.</p>
<p>Types of free dance you can try include events advertised as "conscious dance" or "ecstatic dance", or actual practices such as Authentic Movement or 5Rhythms work, among others.</p>
