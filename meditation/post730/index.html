  <h1>Anyone here believe or practice the Radha Soami meditation?</h1>

<p>I don't have any direct experience with Radha Soami meditation. I do have some experience with sound meditation similar to the one they describe, and with a variety of spiritual teachers and communities.</p>
<p>The first point — the point central to your situation — is <em>what do you want</em>? Your aim should be clear, so you can determine clearly which paths will support your aim and which will not.</p>
<p>Your aim should also be repeatedly clarified. What at first we think we need or want often turns out not to be the case, or only part of the story. It is beneficial to seek healing for oneself, but if it all ends only with you getting what you want and excluding everyone else, that's not complete. Your true direction is greater than that. So while you seek your healing, please consider what your healed, whole, vibrant life will be used for.</p>
<p>For those seeking relief from anxiety, negativity, fear, pressure, and self-blame, there are many paths that can help. Some paths do have a twisted or sinister side to them, which it's wise to be aware of. But many meditative methods and traditions are quite viable. The important point won't necessarily be finding the perfect situation, it'll be your association with sincere people and your re-application of effort toward peace and clarity.</p>
<p>In my cursory readings about Radha Soami, I see some good signs and a couple of warning signs. I can't say for sure whether this is a "good" or "bad" path, and maybe that's for the best. You should find out for yourself, based on your own wisdom. But I can tell you what comes to mind for me:</p>
<p>I see that the <em>form</em> of the Radha Soami path is complex and involved. There are perhaps many cultural trappings that aren't necessary. But this can be said of many styles, and ultimately you have to choose a way and try it. No path will be free of form, and no path will be free of bullshit. Since your grandparents have been involved for their whole lives, maybe it will be culturally comfortable for you to try. How does it feel to you?</p>
<p>On that point, what fruits have arisen in your grandparents' lives? Are they kind, clear, peaceful, joyful, open? Do they support your better nature, whatever path you may choose? These could be indications that there's something good about their practice. If there is a sense of being closed-minded, dogmatic, dour, unsatisfied, or withholding, those could be indications that either the practice is not so good or they are not performing it so well.</p>
<p>Another warning sign I see is the claim that the teachings of Radha Soami are "the only way" to liberation. When I read that phrase, I feel like running in the opposite direction. It is natural that people who have received life-changing results think well of the path that brought them those results; but to claim it is the <em>only way</em> is too closed-minded for my liking, and I think it is dangerous. The thinking that "we are best, everything else is inferior" creates a shadow, a dark area of denial in the collective mind that filters perception a certain way and that controls behavior from the depths of unconsciousness. Likewise, the notion that one person or group has something that is then bestowed on you — as this group seems to put forward — rings an alarm bell for me. (Whatever "God" you eventually get has been your own self, your own mind, from the beginning; don't forget that.) Every path has a shadow, but "only our way" paths have a bigger one.</p>
<p>The requirement of "personal loyalty to a living master" is not unusual. Many paths have good reason to include this as a requirement. Often it's for the better; sometimes it is abused by the person in power, the "master". I would first want to establish a deep trust based on personal face-to-face experience; and I would want to witness the person's interaction with others in a wide range of situations before submitting myself wholeheartedly. But there can indeed be a great value to surrendering oneself completely. The essential question is whether the master has the ability to consistently respond from beyond his ego. Submission to a master is one valid form, but not the only one. How does it suit you?</p>
<p>Some promising points that appear in relation to the Radha Soami path: the insistence on ethical behavior; a clean and kind relationship to food (vegetarianism); emphasis on effort in meditation (over 2 hours of practice daily); a focus on God consciousness within oneself (rather than separate from oneself) and on cultivating and expressing Love.</p>
<p>People are fond of comparing systems. In the martial arts world there's a famous saying that it's not the art it's the practitioner. A sincere heart and determined effort can make the best of any path. Keep trying, and don't lose your sincerity, and you'll come through clean on the other side.</p>
