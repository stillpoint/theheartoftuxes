  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Our modern western society is very disconnected. Even the way we see and conceive of these issues is disconnected. You conceive of an issue with 'spirituality', as if it's a separate facet, some particular aspect that needs to be boosted; whereas a tribal healer might see disconnection itself, a lack of integrity or 'loss of soul' (loss of life force due to lack of unity and flow).</p>
<p>We can get into the habit of keeping ourselves small and controlled. The ego thinks of it as comfort, only because it seeks control and assurance of its domination, but for the <em>organism</em>, for the whole being, it is very cramped, claustrophobic, and unhealthy. When we habitually avoid feeling fear or boundlessness, or reject emotions like grief or joy that could bring new forms into our life, we start to play a control game: our inner motives become focused on assuring comfortable outcomes rather than trusting changes. And of course, the aimed-at comfort never completely emerges. We're left clinging to scraps; but our clinging has become the top priority.</p>
<p>Disconnection can have sudden or gradual causes, but in general it's a disruption of the spontaneous and integral flow of your life. Perhaps there was a traumatic event that caused you to shut down your feelings out of self-protection, or perhaps it's the constant grind of the mundane and the growing habit of goal-orientation rather than full participation (abandoning integrity in little ways in order to achieve seemingly practical goals).</p>
<p>'Soul' or integrity can be understood not as some object or substance, but as the name for a state of unity. When your feeling, thinking, action, and situation are all together, that is 'soul' or integrity. It's like a truly soulful singer whose body, mind, and heart are all unified in the music -- nothing is held back, nothing is insincere or contrived. That has a powerful flow to it, a life force. So we are often tasked with regaining the flow of our life force, to become whole and spontaneous again.</p>
<p>Although there are many gateways to regaining integrity, it comes down to <em>movement</em>. In many cases, if you just start moving what is stuck, your innate integrity will emerge again. If you've become a slave to the mundane, it may be time for a challenge or adventure. If your body has been stagnant, it may be time to invite it into free dance and play. If your emotions have been stuck, it may be time to reconnect and express through journaling, artwork, or heart-to-heart communication. If relationship is not flowing, it may be time to coax it into new forms, new possibilities... or move on.</p>
<p>Often our spiritual dimension gets pinned down by depression. The spiritual motive is there, but our heart is not flowing because we've been avoiding certain feelings either intentionally or unconsciously. There are many possible triggers or causes. Imbalance in basic lifestyle rhythms (poor sleeping, eating, and physical activity) can be a contributing cause. Sudden traumatic event or undigested sadness can be a cause. Neglecting joy and gratitude can be a cause (see <em>Ho'oponopono</em>, a powerful healing practice).</p>
<p>This points to the fact that often some kind of practical change needs to happen: we may need to change lifestyle habits or stand up for ourselves more in work or relationship.</p>
<p>There are practices and rituals designed to reclaim integrity. Soul retrieval in shamanic rituals aims at this very pattern. There are many heading rituals and modalities available, from Tibetan Lagug to Hawaiian Lomi-Lomi to Native American vision quest. (Search 'soul retrieval'.)</p>
<p>Perhaps a more specifically targeted (and possibly less holistic) modern variation is psychotherapy. Strongly committed spiritual practice like meditation retreat, periods of intensive prostration or chanting practice (or in aboriginal communities, drumming or rattle-shaking), or <em>Ngondro</em> commitment or retreat also serve as effective methods of self-reclamation.</p>
<p>If you feel your state requires an intervention, seek out a capable, authorized guide for ceremony or retreat. (There are a fair number of incapable self-proclaimed guides who are successful because so many people attach to special experience rather than quiet sincerity.) Or you may decide to take a bold measure to shake up your life and get it moving spontaneously again. Just take care that you don't put all your eggs into the 'shaking up' basket: some people set out on an around-the-world trip and return with profound emptiness because they've been trying to get fulfillment from the experience (which is not possible) rather than just using the experience as a catalyst. Others look to a substance (like ayahuasca) to do the work for them, which disrespects both their own integrity and the sacred tradition of the substance use. Gateway substances can be powerful, but should be used in proper respectful context with a capable guide. You get the result of your own attachment, even in pursuit of healing. You still have to do your spiritual practice and keep your correct focus on non-grasping, clarity, and compassion.</p>
<p>I highly recommend movement practice and free dance in situations like you describe. In free dance, all levels of self can be expressed. There is hardly any artistic or healing practice that is so holistic, so complete. Even a half hour of welcoming the bodymind into sincere movement can make a big change in mood and perspective. Longer sessions can -- if you learn how to properly ground yourself -- be ecstatic and deeply transformative. In movement, you can embody specific wounds, stuck patterns, and life issues, making pain into art and bringing consciousness to dark places; and you can generate flow in places you never would have guessed it would live. You can also <em>just dance for the hell of it</em>! The movement takes on its own life, it's own unfolding: start moving the body, and the heart, mind, and spirit all find their own dance together. Again, proper respect for the power of the catalyst is required, and having a capable guide and being able to ground yourself in plain reality are crucial.</p>
<p>Rhythm itself is a powerful sacrament. Free dance, drumming, chanting, rattle-shaking, prayer-wheel spinning, and prostrations all participate in entrainment through rhythm -- bringing you back to wholeness and the rhythm of life through rhythmic repetition.</p>
<p>I recommend any of these wonderful movement practices: Open Floor, Soul Motion, 5 Rhythms, Authentic Movement, Movement Medicine.</p>
<p>Nature can also be profoundly healing. If you have the skill, spending time in the wilderness can help you reconnect. A couple of weeks following the natural rhythms of sunrise and sunset, gazing at the boundless night sky, and being in close connection with the elements can remind you of your natural, ever-changing, impermanent aspects and your pure, clear, eternal aspect.</p>
<p>Some soul reclamation ceremonies include all of these elements: guided spiritual practice and introspection, dance/movement/rhythmic expression, and natural setting.</p>
