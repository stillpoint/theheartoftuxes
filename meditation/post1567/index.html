  <h1>Three observations from my morning meditation</h1>

<p>Although all kinds of practices fall under the umbrella term "meditation", correct meditation has a very specific meaning.</p>
<p>We can distinguish between <em>contemplation</em>, <em>concentration</em>, and <em>meditation</em>.</p>
<p>Analysis and reflection fall under the category of <strong>contemplation</strong>. It involves active thinking. Reflecting on beneficial qualities, considering the outcomes of actions, or noting the processes that combine to make up a "body" may all be considered contemplation. If journalling has a very specific goal and form — for instance, looking into the origin of one's thoughts, without diverting attention to other sundry matters — then it might be called contemplation as well.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong> means letting go of everything but one object. One relinquishes all other diversions, all other stimuli, and keeps returning to one object of focus. One gets closer and closer to that object, until it becomes apparent that subject (you) and object are not separate. This realization does not appear within concentration, because within concentration there is just oneness, just the fact of breathing or just the sound or whatever the object of focus is. The realization appears when <em>in the vicinity</em> of oneness, when once again the separate subject appears which can experience the realization.</p>
<p>Journalling may involve early stages of concentration, as one applies oneself to the task and withdraws from other thoughts and activities, but I would think that it rarely approaches one-pointedness since there is still much mental activity.</p>
<p>In addition, there tends to be an inherent separation between subject and object — the you that is observing and writing on one side, and whatever you're writing about (the content of your meditation, in your case) on the other side. This separation is constantly reinforced in the activity of journalling as we usually understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong> means keeping a not-moving mind, a mind that is completely momentary. There is no grasping, no cultivating, no moving toward or away from anything. It is completely open-handed. You don't add anything to the bare moment, and yet you are completely awake and engaged with it. There is inherent concentration in this because the mind doesn't move toward any object; in fact, it doesn't make any subject or object at all, there is just the plain truth of whatever is happening. But it is not limited to mere concentration, because everything is included. In most cases, journalling can't reach this practice because it involves a particular intention as well as focuses on certain objects of thought.</p>
<p>So in one sense, journalling goes along with the constant stream of thinking that is our prison. The stream of thought creates the thought-world we usually live in, and keeps us from directly experiencing the real world. So meditatively journalling is not the best; and that's why it is done at another time — after, not during meditation.</p>
<p>But there are some benefits to journalling as well. As mentioned above, it can be somewhat calming or concentrating, like any task you apply yourself to. Knitting, running, or making train models could all have this in common, if performed in a focused manner. Because it goes along with the stream of thinking, journalling can offer comfort to those not used to (or threatened by) the sometimes profound silence of meditation. And while there is a stream of thinking involved, it can be constantly steered toward a beneficial end, which is understanding one's mind habits and organizing one's conception of meditation and spirituality. Instead of the monkey-mind swinging from topic to topic as usual, it is repeatedly brought back to the task of looking into what just happened in meditation. This can be considered a preliminary form of discipline.</p>
<p>And furthermore, one can feel settled in the process of journalling because it allows one to express almost anything. All of those random thoughts, doubts, agitations, realizations, creative connections, and so on can be let go of, dumped onto the paper. You don't have to hold on to them any more; they have been recorded. So in this way you can let go and move on to the next thing, which is an extremely important skill in meditation. It is just that one would hope to develop that skill to the point where pen and paper aren't necessary.</p>
<p>If you find it helpful, do journalling. If your main aim is to refine your meditation (to approach awakening, for instance), then at some point you should be able and willing to drop the journalling and drop any self-reflecting thought and just move on to the next thing moment to moment. This will help dissolve the thinking, checking habit and help uproot the illusory separation between subject and object — the separation between you and real life.</p>
<p>So there are advantages and disadvantages. If your direction is clear, you can use anything well.</p>
<p>If you trust your instructor, follow his guidance. In the process of entrusting yourself to a clear practice you will learn valuable lessons about practice, and that will be your own experience, your own wisdom. This is much better than either flitting from form to form or making changes based on what someone else says. It is the combination of clear guidance and your own consistent effort that brings the best result.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I do conceive of a journalling type of practice that could be correctly called meditative. It would mean an absolute adherence to expressing oneself openly and spontaneously, without censoring and <em>without adding any secondary thoughts</em>. It would be impossible to record all of the impulses at the speed with which they appear, and also impossible to reflect their breadth and subtlety; but if one was absolutely unattached to the words being written, that constant moment-to-moment openhandedness would actually be meditative. When nothing appears, there would be no movement; when something appears, it would be instantly reflected without a second thought. This is possible. But it would also be easy to fool oneself into a bad practice, mistaking indulgence for sincere spontaneity. (This mistake is the bane of the art world.)</p>
