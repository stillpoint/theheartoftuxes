  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Beginners often get so self-fascinated, and make a big deal about nothing. Get used to unusual experiences as well as long tracts of very plain experiences. Don't attach to either. Don't let speculation and tinkering take you out of meditation. <strong>Don't touch!</strong></p>
<p>So it's not necessary to track and describe everything that's going on. Let it all be, and all energies will begin to flow wherever they need to flow.</p>
<p>The confident pro football player doesn't make a big deal of mistakes and doesn't make a big deal when he scores a touchdown; he just goes about his business, moving on to the next task. Approach meditation like this. Don't make a big deal of anything that arises; only get back to meditating.</p>
<p>This sensation is common. Most often it amounts to 'chi effect', which is a local blockage that has been revealed in meditation for one reason or another.</p>
<p>That is, local blockages that were previously not noticed because (A) your mind was too busy to notice them, or (B) there was previously not much energy or flow, so they didn't have much impact, or (C) you have increased a pattern of tension with either the physical posture or the mental attitude in mediation.</p>
<p>I won't get into the connections with chakras, the pineal gland, and other energy anatomy that takes you down the rabbit hole unnecessarily. For the most part, relaxed, non-grasping attitude will make all the difference.</p>
<p>The head is a very common place for these blockages to manifest. It is because we live 'up in our head' most of the time. We are a very disembodied culture. In ancient Greece, for instance, the ideal training regimen for many vocations involved more physical cultivation than any other type of activity. The importance of the body, its physical health and fitness, and one's embodiment — one's <em>residence</em> in the body — was well recognized.</p>
<p>But in our modern day and age, our bodies are much more stagnant and also quite disowned. We distance ourselves from emotion, sexuality, and physical expression; and we glorify and attach to thought, opinion, mental images, relationship with 'thinking machines', electronic communication, and acquisition of data (most of it absolutely trivial).</p>
<p>As a result, our personal energy becomes lodged in the head. A meditation practice that is unbalanced toward the mental rather than including physicality and flow can contribute to that. So it is extremely important to do away with grasping attitude. Striving to achieve states of mind or insights or knowledges leads to energy getting stuck up in the head.</p>
<p>That's why for many experienced meditators, the general concern is in 'bringing the energy down', letting go of the grasping and armoring that create tension up high, and instead settling the body weight downward and engendering spacious, open presence.</p>
<p>Some important and helpful points in cases of energy blocked in the head:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Touching the tongue to the palate of the mouth is important. It closes the circuit of energy and allows  a flow through the main central channels (up the spine, through the skull, and down the front of the body to the perineum).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relaxing and releasing weight downward is helpful — but without slumping, which creates tension and blockage. Sit like a mountain, heavy on the bottom and wafting and opening up top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical practice is a very important part of overall training. Vigorous, rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath movement — enough to break a sweat — is extremely effective at bringing energy down to its proper place in the body (at the lower belly). Prostrations are very excellent. Running, swimming, fast walking or hiking, cycling, and free dance are also very good. Taiji, Yoga, and some forms of Qigong or other internal-energy Kung Fu are effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some forms of bodywork can also be helpful. Thai Massage, Tui Na, Shiatsu, and Acupuncture can be effective if performed by someone who understands how energy manifests in meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the energy is stuck in the head too long it can become an intractable pattern, difficult or even impossible to change. This is given various names like 'spiritual sickness' or 'kundalini sickness'. It especially becomes problematic when one advances in meditation and begins generating more powerful energies. Without proper flow, these greater energies can 'burn out' the internal channels, creating mood imbalances, insomnia, intense migraine headaches, fever, or even insanity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some techniques have been passed down by masters to remedy this kind of sickness. They generally feature deep, slow, and very, very gentle breathing (almost so you don't feel the passage of air) along with either intentional relaxation or more meticulous visualization of melting that starts at the crown of the head and oozes downward. (Some methods recommend visualizing fragrant cream descending through the body and softening it; others just descent systematically with the attention and the intent to soften and melt.)</p>
<p>Zen Masters Hakuin and Chinul have both described different but similar healing practices for 'spiritual sickness'. Those in dire straits can also check Bruce Frantzis' similar description of Water Method. And Gopi Krishna, who himself went through severely painful and burning kundalini sickness, also speaks in detail about precautions and treatments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many <em>traditional</em> courses of yoga, across cultures, aim at preparing the physical and energetic bodies for the changes that come with meditation. There is a tremendously deep body of knowledge in this field from India and Tibet; and the traditional courses of training will generally have safety measures built in. Physical postures, breath training, and the development of sensitivity to internal energy are parts of a wholistic approach that aims at profound attainment in meditation. In other words, it's not about sporting nice abs and showing off postures on a cliffside, but about supporting the effort toward enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to look into this seriously, or if you have good reason to be concerned about what's going on, you <em>must</em> connect with a proper teacher, live and in-person. This can't be addressed online, much less by sundry opinions and 'best guesses' of inexperienced practitioners.</p>
<p>I will just add that obsessing about energy effects is a big mistake. Energy follows mind; so if you constantly think about manifestations, you create the very attachments and blockages you seek to resolve. The rule of thumb is <strong>let it be, and just follow the method</strong>. That means you must know a proper method, from a proper source, and you must know it well, and you must apply it meticulously.</p>
<p>Don't make a big deal of manifestation. Don't make stories, whether victim stories or "I'm a special meditator" stories. Don't attach to manifestation. Only continue. If after some time you find that there is some problem or pain, consult a teacher. In any case, it's better to consult a teacher before you start making mistakes in the first place.</p>
