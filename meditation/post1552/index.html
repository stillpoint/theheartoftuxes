  <h1>can i workout after i meditate?</h1>

<p>Thank you for your comment and question.</p>
<p>In breath-counting meditation, thinking something else at the same time as counting breaths is <em>okay</em>, but you need to let it go and return more fully to the counting. Letting go of the thinking and returning clearly to the counting is your practice.</p>
<p>Unless it's a very unusual case, everyone will experience a lot of thinking when they first try meditation. Even after gaining a lot of experience, thinking will usually be there; but the experienced meditator is better at letting the thinking go. Why? Because the experienced meditator has practiced letting go of the thinking many, many, many times.</p>
<p>Although the method is to count to a certain number (usually 5 or 10), the most important thing is to be clear and meticulous about letting go of the thinking and returning to <em>this</em> number. This trains your ability to be completely in the present moment.</p>
<p><strong>There are a couple of different thinking situations that can arise in breath counting meditation.</strong> The first is that <strong>thinking appears and takes you away</strong>: you go off on a train of thought for several seconds, or a minute, or twenty minutes or more. At that time, you are only with your thinking, and the counting is very faint or not conscious at all. Sometimes you completely lose count. That is all also okay. It happens to everyone. But at the moment you wake up from your thinking and realize that you've gone away, <strong>instantly and gently return to counting by starting at "one" again.</strong></p>
<p>There are three points here: <em>instantly</em>, <em>gently</em>, and <em>return to counting at "one"</em>. <strong>When you realize that thinking has taken you away, just instantly drop it</strong> like something completely useless. It doesn't matter what the content of the thinking was; it doesn't matter if it was terrible or if it was magnificent, if it was something you forgot to do or if it was an incredible insight into reality. Your job is to drop the thinking and return to the counting. Do not prolong your thinking-dream for even a moment, once you realize you've been taken away. Developing the ability and habit of dropping the thinking instantly will help you tremendously in your future practice.</p>
<p>When you realize you've been taken away by thinking, and you drop the thinking instantly, <strong>let that dropping be gentle</strong>. It's no big deal. That means that you don't fight with your own mind, you don't make a drama about it or judge yourself or try to force the thinking to go away. The more you fight with your thinking, the more your thinking will control you. But this is not about manipulating your mind; it's about letting your mind be. It's about keeping your center no matter what is happening in your thinking or in your environment. Dropping the thinking gently will help prevent the kind of internal fighting that is often a problem for meditators (and non-meditators!).</p>
<p>When you return to counting by dropping the thinking instantly and gently, <strong>start your counting again at one</strong>. If you try to pick up where you left off in counting, you make your practice vague (unclear), you open the door for cheating yourself by making it seem like your counting is clearer than it really is, and you make the process too complex by trying to figure out whether you should continue (say, at the count of "five" or "six"). By always returning to "one" you can return to practice clearly and quickly, without fussing about your relationship to the counting.</p>
<p>One Zen Master told me that when she asks her students how they're doing in counting meditation (counting breaths to "ten"), if her beginner students report that they have made it all the way to "ten" she knows that they're not doing the practice correctly — they're not being clear enough about the method. If they were clear about the method, they would only get to "one" or "two" or "three" before thoughts would come in and they'd have to return to "one". So you see, it's beyond common for thinking to intrude into meditation; it's expected.</p>
<p><strong>The second thinking situation that can arise</strong> is that the counting is continuing fairly clearly, but <strong>thoughts flit in and out</strong> like birds around your head or like mist wafting by: you can keep count, but there's still mental activity. There's just not necessarily a train of thought that you disappear in. In this case, the thoughts only take you away for the briefest fraction of a second, and you are still aware of where you are in the counting. Or sometimes a song or phrase keeps fading in and out. It is okay to continue the counting in this case, but you should do what you can to settle in even more and let the counting become more prominent and clear. Go deeper.</p>
<p>A couple of things that may help bring the counting to greater clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relax more. Relax your body and relax your mind. It's not a fight. Your clear mind is like a mountain that is unaffected by the clouds that come and go; so settle down into your mountain nature. This can be helpful when first taking the sitting posture: like a mountain, the bottom of the body should be heavy and rooted and stable, and the upper body should be light and upright and noble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your posture is correct. Upright (not stiff) body posture and gentle but clear hand posture will help your mind to focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the emphasis on being momentary. Even within whatever number you are on, keep a continuous focus, letting each moment be clear. The attention is not only applied when you start counting the number, but all the way through: "Onnnnnnnnnnnnnne....." "Twooooooooooooo....." "Threeeeeeeee......." Let the beginning, middle, and end of each number be just as clear, and let the space between numbers also be clear. Once you start applying this continuous attention, you will see that it can go deeper and deeper, more and more momentary. When you focus on being more momentary, there is eventually no gap where thoughts can enter and disturb. This is concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on your breathing pattern, some adjustment of your relationship with breathing may help. Your breathing shouldn't be forced. Forced breathing can indeed help concentration, but it is eventually exhausting, and it creates a bad relationship with your mind. Don't make monsters within yourself; let everything be as it is while maintaining your center. This is the development of compassion — being able to be present and open with all of your mind-states (and anyone else's). Natural breathing is important, but if an unnaturally shallow pattern has been developed in your life, some other movement and/or breathing practice (outside of your meditation) can help open it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another helpful breathing point is that the space at the turning of the breath, between in- and out-breaths, has a very comfortable and silent quality; so allowing that space between breaths and between counts to be clear will not only help you focus, it will be very pleasant indeed. So at the end of your very clear current number — "Sevvvvvven...." — there is an open space that has kind of a weightless quality, like when you toss a ball up into the air and it reaches its highest point and is momentarily still. That still and open space can be connected to and carried into the next number, so each number is a deepening stillness and openness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two aspects of clarity in your counting practice: the number should be clear, and you should not lose count. The clarity of the momentary number relates to wisdom; the clarity of the whole series relates to compassion. Of course, there will be many, many times (for all meditators) when this is not the case. No problem! Only continue by returning instantly and gently, not getting caught up in any drama about it. Don't give things the power to disturb you.</p>
