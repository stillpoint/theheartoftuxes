  <h1>I serious obstacle to meditation. Is it also happening to others? Is there an effective practical approach against it?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>What do you mean by drug use?</em></p>
<p>I mean recreational drugs, including psychedelics, used where meditation is also part of the picture.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>As far as I read on the topic, only weed could trigger this kind of effects (this is why I gave up weed about 1 year ago). Regarding psychedelic use, I didn't stumble upon even one single case of such effect - on the contrary: recently Norwegian scientists linked lsd with curing mental afflictions.</em></p>
<p>I'm not condemning psychoactive substances. In personal experience and in available literature, synthetic and organic psychedelics and entheogens have shown certain usefulness. Nothing is good or bad; the question is cause and effect. I'm just reporting that in my experience online as well as in face-to-face interactions with meditators, the ones who have the most difficulty with depersonalization and feelings of unreality are those who have been involved in drug use.</p>
<p>From what I see, there is a direct connection; but the causality of that connection is not clear. It may be that the substances are not implicated but rather the mindset of people trying to take a shortcut or grasping at experience. The pursuit of experience itself is a hindrance; it turns open awareness to an object-focused, dualistic relationship.</p>
<p>So I don't know whether the decisive cause is the attitude of the individual, the biochemical effect of the substances themselves, or boundary-dissolving experiences that happen without commensurate grounding and training that would allow the psychonaut to return and assimilate the experience; I just know that I've almost invariably seen serious difficulty with depersonalization associated between tripping and meditation.</p>
<p>For those without a strong psychic structure built through training (or through excellent parenting) — without strong character, awareness, and clarity — ground-shaking, mind-bending experiences can be more trouble than they're worth. There doesn't yet exist the context within which the experience can take root. Even so, although it may involve a great deal of suffering along the way, if the practitioner is persistent he can eventually attain something real, guided by the memory of the experience.</p>
<p>Those bent on using psychoactive substances may do better to pursue shamanistic paths rather than meditation — but paths where the person works under the close scrutiny of a teacher or shaman. In these situations, the external structure provided by the guide, the setting, and the practice community takes the place of one's own strength of mind and character, until that structure is internalized as the person's own grounding ability. You might say that shamanism specializes in training practitioners to return from trips.</p>
<p>The issue you ask about has to do with fear of accessing or stirring up "nasty mental shit". Since psychoactive substances suppress filters and provide entry-ways to the mind, one would think you'd avoid using them if that is your concern.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>About the meditation method, which should I go for?</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>So far, I suspect that "mindfulness meditation" appears to be the most reasonable.</em></p>
<p>I think you're right, that mindfulness practice would be useful in your situation. Rather than sitting in a situation where you have nothing to face but your own mind, you can train your focusing and grounding abilities by applying your attention during everyday activity.</p>
<p>Let's just check, though, what you understand by "mindfulness meditation". Just so there's no mix-up about what you'll actually be doing.</p>
<p>As humans, we have a deeply ingrained habit of trying to manipulate the mind. We try to avoid certain states and get and hold others. A meditator must reject this habit; but those who have not had the benefit of good teaching (or <em>enough</em> good teaching) sometimes use meditation itself to manipulate the mind.</p>
<p>Any pressure put on the mind will make strange stuff come up. But even if you remain open in your relationship with the mind, the strange or nasty stuff caused by your <em>past</em> actions will still come up. You can't stop it coming up; but you can change your relationship with it and the way it unfolds.</p>
<p>You may seek counselling or therapeutic help to change your relationship with your mind. Or continuing with mindfulness meditation may gradually effect that change. When you are ready to sit with curious engagement rather than fear you can return to sitting meditation. Having an experienced guide will almost certainly be a benefit.</p>
<p>Remember that it is not the material of the mind that is a problem; it's your <em>thinking</em> about what appears that makes a problem. You anticipate something terrible. Mindfulness will help your mind settle in the present moment, so you won't be anticipating and making problems with your thinking.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
