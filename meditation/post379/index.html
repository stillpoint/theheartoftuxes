  <h1>Level of concentration during Samadhi?</h1>

<p>You are confusing the terms <em>samadhi</em> and <em>samatha</em> (also spelled <em>shamatha</em>). <em>Samatha</em> refers to concentration-style meditation such as focusing on the breath at the nostrils, among others. The word means calmness or pacification; it is the pacification of the distracted mind by bringing it back to an object repeatedly. After being brought back repeatedly the distraction gradually dissipates, and one rests in the peace or calmness of non-distracted presence. The name for this process is "concentration".</p>
<p><em>Samadhi</em> is something different altogether, and something that is not your concern right now. Eventually, when the concentration has been trained well, one may enter a state where non-distracted presence persists without any effort to maintain it. The object of meditation and the observing mind become unified, without one experiencing any sense of either.</p>
<p>It is not at all important to think of this <em>samadhi</em> at your stage of practice. You should be concerned with learning and following the method well, and especially with understanding the purpose for the method. When you understand the correct aim of meditation you can better understand the reason for the particular instructions.</p>
<p>You have added your own parts to <em>samatha</em> method, and that is not at all good. So I have to ask where you learned the method, and why you don't follow the method the way it is taught. If you have a reliable source of teaching you should follow it meticulously and refrain from adding your own adaptations.</p>
<p>You say you try to focus very hard on the sensation of breath at the nostrils. This is not terrible but not great. You should just focus on the sensation. Trying "very hard" is adding something extra of your own, which is not necessary â€” it tends to create a story or self-image (of yourself as one who is trying hard), it builds up tension, and it promotes a dualistic relationship ("me" versus distraction; or "me" and the sensation), all of which perpetuate the false sense of self that the meditation is meant to overcome.</p>
<p>Apply the attention sincerely; apply the attention devotedly and with interest; but don't push to make anything happen. It's not your job to create any particular experience or state of mind. Just watch.</p>
<p>Next, who defines a sensation as undesired? You are the only one who defines it. It is only undesired because you have made it so. Again, this creates a dualism, a separation between you and feeling; so again you are making an unnecessary fight in your mind. Stop thinking of some sensations as valid and others as not valid. It's also not your job to edit or judge sensations. Just disengage from other sensations and return to feeling the breath at the nostrils.</p>
<p>You should not be dallying with any thoughts, and you should not be dallying with any sensations other than the object of meditation (in this case, breath at the nostrils). Let them be, but return to feeling the breath at the nostrils. Don't touch either thoughts or sensations.</p>
<p>Your language is vague because you have a vague idea of the method and why the method is used. <em>Samatha</em> concentration is used in concert with <em>vipassana</em> / insight meditation so you can gain insight into your true nature and awaken from the illusion of life you currently live in. <em>Samatha</em> is meant to train your ability to stay present so that you will actually be able to perceive the subtle and fleeting things revealed in <em>vipassana</em>; if you can't stay openly present you won't be able to make use of the insight available.</p>
<p>Some meditators may continue with <em>samatha</em> practice beyond the minimum concentration necessary for the success of <em>vipassana</em>. They deepen the concentrative power and experience states of more complete and subtle 'absorption'. Mundane and supramundane psychic powers may appear as a result. These are only useful within the context of correct direction: waking up in order to help all others wake up.</p>
<p>While it may be said that greater silence and stillness is to be expected in <em>samatha</em> meditation, it is not for <em>you</em> to go looking for it. Every time you check whether you have it or not is an instance of stepping out of meditation. So never mind what comes, and when; only return to the method. Likewise, you shouldn't think that a calm meditation is successful and one that is not calm is not successful; success is when you consistently re-apply your attention to the object of meditation. The returning and re-applying are the success. Through that you develop equanimity, so as not to be tossed around by results. You must train your mind not to get giddy about certain experiences, and not to get discouraged by others. All experience is equal. Your task is to let it go, let it be, and only return to the method.</p>
<p>"Glossing over" thoughts shouldn't mean you linger with them. Thoughts can appear; just don't let them take you away from clearly feeling the sensation at the nostrils. If thoughts or sensations do take you away, then the moment you notice it simply and gently return to the method.</p>
<p>You are confused about where tension is arising. You think that you should be engaging with thoughts that arise because they are supposedly 'natural'. They are <em>not</em> natural; they are covering up your natural clear and peaceful mind. It's just that you are used to them, having indulged in them time and again. So they are common to you, not natural.</p>
<p>If you try to suppress thoughts, that indeed leads to tension; so don't judge any thought good or bad, and don't move toward or away from any thought. Only return to the object of meditation, letting go of all else. The notion that you should allow yourself to engage with thoughts and feelings is mistaken, and indulgent. The notion that you must have no thought or feeling is mistaken, and ascetic. Let thoughts and feelings be, and just return to feeling the breath at the nostrils.</p>
<p>You may have more experiences where everything goes quiet or disappears. That is fine. Once you return, immediately go back to feeling the sensation at the nostrils. Don't judge intensity. Yes, you can do the practice by placing your attention and holding it at the nostrils. You can be aware of other sensations, but don't let the mind wander to them.</p>
<p>If <em>samatha</em> meditation particularly interests you, you can hook up with a capable teacher or follow a traditional course of training. At certain levels you may be instructed to let go of previous methods or previous objects of meditation. For instance, once the concentration on the object is very stable you may be instructed to let go of the object and focus instead of the awareness that had been embracing it. Stage by stage, previous objects are relinquished until very clear and high-class absorptions are attained. But that's not where you are right now, so no need to worry about it.</p>
<p>Main point: know that the correct direction of meditation is always toward awakening, for the benefit of all others.</p>
