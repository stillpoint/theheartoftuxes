  <h1>What is a good way to earn a living that promotes mindfulness and can coexist side by side with a serious meditation practice?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>If that is the case then why do more experienced members, like yourself, bother to write out such compelling comments on this forum? Why isn't the answer to every thread "don't worry about it, just keep following the method"?</em> </p>
<p>Not thinking about it is <em>your</em> task. It's for <em>you</em>, so that you can properly digest all this and make it into wisdom. If you make and hold opinions, you can't digest your life.</p>
<p>But that is a completely different issue from receiving teaching. You need teaching. You need <em>good</em> teaching, and lots of it. Over time it will sink in. By virtue of your own practice and experimentation and letting-be, it will be digested and will become your wisdom. It's not that you shouldn't receive teaching â€” far from it! But you shouldn't attach to it. You shouldn't make ideas about it. You shouldn't think there's a final answer to get.</p>
<p>When you are around an advanced spiritual person it will be more clear to you. You can see how well they function, how vibrant and compassionate they are, but also how little they engage in speculating, theorizing, opinionating, debating, and gossiping. The common person thinks that everything is arbitrated through thinking, so if they think the right thing they'll "get it". A practice person knows that <em>putting it all down</em> is what digests life. You can't "get it", you can only <em>be</em> it.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>My truth is that obviously my practice is not for all other beings. My practice is completely selfish and only for my happiness and freedom from all that I deem negative.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I appreciate that honesty. That honesty is already helping all beings.</p>
<p>But you see, now you are starting to consider it. Whereas before it may not even have been on your radar, now it is an issue that is raising doubt. It is working on you, and you are working on it. Give it time.</p>
<p>You already have a clear, compassionate mind and heart. Your original mind is already that way; it is just being filtered through the person you think you are, based on conditioning and past actions. Once your ignorance gets clarified your true mind of compassion will shine forth.</p>
<p>There is already a lot of evidence of your compassionate mind. First of all, you wouldn't even be in this forum, conversing with me in a very civil manner, trusting me with your concerns, if you didn't have sincerity and compassion.</p>
<p>Next, you want to relieve your own suffering. You are waking up to the universal truth of cause and effect, seeing how you make your own suffering, and now you want to do something to help yourself. That is compassion for yourself. The more you practice, the more you will understand who you really are. You will see that you are not separate from anything, that you depend on every other being for your existence and for everything that you achieve in life. The more you see who you really are, the more your self-compassion will broaden into compassion for all. You will react to another's suffering as your own.</p>
<p>And this reaction also is already within you. When you see the good guy in a movie being unfairly abused, you root for him to overcome that and come out on top. When you see an animal suffering pain, your heart has a reaction of pity. So you already have the mind of compassion. Now, step by step you let it grow until it becomes limitless.</p>
<p>The fact is that if you really care about escaping your own suffering, you must have compassion for others. There is no way you can be happy without caring for others. No way. Your own happiness and your compassion for others are absolutely tied.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Whatever joy there is in this world</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;All comes from desiring others to be happy,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;And whatever suffering there is in this world</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;All comes from desiring myself to be happy.</p>
<p>â€“ Shantideva, <em>Bodhicharyavatara</em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Don't worry, it will all come clear in time. Don't grasp, just put it all down. You will be relieved.</p>
<p>And if you think that you have to try and remember everything, put that down too. This is where you start the practice of trusting yourself. What I've offered has already gone into you; it's already at work within you. No need to try figuring it all out. Put it all down in a moment. Then again, put it all down. Then again.</p>
<p>In this way (putting it all down), you have a correct relationship to the moment, and your wisdom can function. You don't have to worry about making mistakes. You <em>will</em> make mistakes. So then, just correct them. It is all okay. What you choose is okay. If you can, find something you like and are good at. If you can't, do your best and practice offering yourself to your work until a new opportunity comes up. Both situations are okay. This and that are both okay. Just this moment, put it all down and get a taste of your <em>real</em> life that is not wound up in fretting and imagining.</p>
<p>When you put it all down, your heart is sincere. Uncontrived, open to possibility. That sincerity will attract all kinds of help. You will get help from places you can't fathom. Just don't expect it to be the thing that <em>you</em> conceive or want; it will be the thing that helps you on the path toward happiness, but it may not come in the form your figuring-out mind expects.</p>
