  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>How do you imagine it — what do you suppose happens? In any case, that is your imagination rather than the actuality. If you meet any people truly accomplished in spiritual practice you will find that they are far more vibrant, spontaneous, kind, adaptable, balanced, sane, joyful, and possessed of integrity than the common person. And if you begin to attain the fruits of proper meditation yourself you will find that you become <em>more</em> of who you really are, not less.</p>
<p>So it's not that the ego becomes obliterated; it's that it becomes functional, and works in its proper relationship <em>following</em> wisdom rather than leading you around by the nose.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Usually when something goes wrong or weird it's because you weren't meant to do that.</em></p>
<p>Define 'weird'. That's so broad as to be meaningless. 'Weird' could mean someone from an immigrant culture. Are Mexicans or Syrians not meant to exist because you or someone else find them weird? This fear of the unfamiliar too is generated by a thinking and imagining process that has kidnapped you. You conflate the unfamiliar with danger and add your own label of 'wrong' to it.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong is that we live in a world of illusion, made by our thinking minds. What most people relate to most of the time is their own idea and judgment of things or people, rather than the things or people themselves. Opinions implanted and conditioned by parents, teachers, peers, social group, culture, and religion lie in thick layers over plain reality. People are controlled by their own views and thoughts, slaves to their illusory world. And the most severe of these conditioned, illusory views is the notion of selfhood.</p>
<p>People don't understand who or what they really are, and all kinds of trouble and evil come from that one misunderstanding.</p>
<p>So the way we commonly go about life — <em>this usual, common, habitual mind</em> — is the dysfunctional, wrong thing. It is familiar, but it is wrong. Confusing the ego for the essential self is the dysfunction. Meditation is meant to return us to our original complete nature.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt; <em>How do I know this whole meditation thing isn't just hurting me in the long run?</em></p>
<p>You investigate, with scientific mind, letting go of prejudiced opinion and researching what is <em>really</em> the case. If you have knee-jerk suspicion, that may be a sign that your conditioned thinking is kicking in, and that you are not actually looking with an open mind but rather reacting out of fear.</p>
<p>The meditator or spiritual neophyte is not expected to just take things based on someone else's authority, but to investigate and research. They are expected to use their own reason as well as their <em>experience</em>, setting aside entrenched opinions, whether the opinions are for or against.</p>
<p>You do research to find out where the trusted sources of teaching are. You listen and learn about the aims of training and the methods for achieving those aims. You don't assume that your shallowest assumption is what the teachers mean; you take the time to look deeply. You watch to see how accomplished practitioners and respected teachers behave: do they act consistently with compassion; do their actions match their words; are they themselves clear and stable?</p>
<p>When you find enough evidence to reasonably proceed, you try the training, step by step. The more evidence you gain through direct experience, the more you let go of mistrust and skepticism, and presumably the more good results you gain. If you find a teacher or situation that doesn't exemplify the teachings, you research further to determine the cause: is it a personal failing, or is it something inherently wrong with the teachings? If you find that your own experience doesn't match the expected results, you similarly check for the reason: have you applied the correct teaching in the correct way with the correct consistency?</p>
<p>This is how you know the whole thing won't hurt you in the long run: you learn, guided by rational investigation rather than prejudice. But there's a point past which you can't know. At some point — and you encounter it quite early in your spiritual career — you have to take a step, or a leap, based on trust in yourself, trust in the essential goodness of life. If you wait to have every last thing explained to you, you will wait forever. So besides rationality, <em>courage</em> is also an essential quality on the meditative or spiritual path.</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt;<em>When your leg goes all tingly and falls asleep it's because you sat on it too long....</em></p>
<p>(This is a side issue, but I thought I'd speak to it as well.) No, this is not necessarily true; and it's not necessarily harmful. The leg could fall asleep because you've not yet learned to sit <em>properly</em>, or because you've lost your youthful flexibility. People think the leg falling asleep has to do with lack of circulation, but if that were the case your tissues would necrotize and you'd have to amputate. It's pressure on the nerve at the back of the leg that does it, and there are various reasons for this.</p>
<p>One very simple remedy that helps a lot of meditators is moving forward to the front edge of their cushion so their weight is solidly on their sitbones (ischeal tuberosity) rather than pressing on the back of the leg. Anyway, many meditators experience legs falling asleep time and again, year after year, with no ill effects other than the pins and needles feeling. So if this is the trade off for a mind that is stable, clear, free, happy, and rooted in reality, then it's quite mistaken to simply claim "you shouldn't do that because it feels weird or uncomfortable".</p>
<p>And if we take this a step further we may see that the weird and uncomfortable are actually <em>necessary</em> on the path. If anything is to change in any significant way, we need to move out of what we know and into what we don't; we have to give up what we have been and become what we are not yet. Clinging to comfort is the practice of clinging. It makes us weak and rigid, ill prepared for anything new.</p>
<p>Escape from discomfort is not supportive of life. Our effort is toward freedom, toward being <em>okay</em> with discomfort, and not letting it control who we are and what we do.</p>
<p>&gt;Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
 – Frank Zappa</p>
