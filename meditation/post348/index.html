  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;Thank you for your wonderful honesty. Even though you are going through a hard time, you have the capacity to be sincere and to reach out. That is wonderful. I respect it greatly.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I've tried some of this stuff here and there, but it never seems to really stick.</em></p>
<p>Even a master has to keep returning to the practice. I think for most of us nothing really 'sticks', we just keep returning.</p>
<p>There's a saying in Zen: <em>seven times falling down, eight times getting up.</em> We fall down; that's what we do. If we didn't fall down, we wouldn't need to pick ourselves up; we wouldn't need practice and therapy and having a talk with ourselves and trying strategies to help ourselves. But everyone who practices falls down. I mean, every human falls down, but also people who do spiritual practice aren't exempt from it.</p>
<p>The falling down we actually can't control very much. It's a result of our karma, our past thoughts and actions and the way the unfold in current conditions. If we're practice, over the long term these things can be purified, but for the most part we fall down repeatedly. The difference between a common person and a master is that the master stands up very quickly.</p>
<p>This difference comes from being very clear about life, seeing the big picture and our place in it. Life is a vast ocean of suffering for countless beings, going around and around chasing pleasure and running from pain, always controlled by their karma. </p>
<p>Whatever we try, death will come to us, taking away all our accomplishments, possessions, relationships. Only the effects of spiritual practice -- ungrasping wisdom and deep compassion -- last beyond death and have the ability to transform our path and liberate us from the big suffering cycle.</p>
<p>So the ability to stand up and return to momentary practice quickly and reliably, comes from being very clear on this point, this overview of life and death.</p>
<p>One more time, coming back to the moment. One more time, opening our hands and letting it be. One more time forgiving ourselves and starting fresh.</p>
<p>&gt;I'll get a good result when I'm feeling in control and doing it in a very "controlled" environment. But when a breakdown happens, or I'm experiencing a real-deal negative event in the moment, I just completely lose all control and capability to "trust" anything I do.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a very accurate description of how it goes for many people. Two points here: First, it shows that you have to gather your good circumstances and use good environments, good relationships, and commitments to help yourself.</p>
<p>Second, few people can do it on their own despite outer circumstances. If they can, it shows that their practice has matured and become very stable. Good, consistent teaching is necessary and correct, consistent practice is necessary. You have to set the groundwork <em>before</em> the crisis arrives, because it is difficult to find balance when outer circumstances are difficult. That's why good training places you in difficulty and shines a light on areas you would otherwise avoid. Those things we'd shirk on our own, in the context of training become the things that strengthen us.</p>
<p>&gt;I had a moment last night where I actively felt angered towards meditation/mindfulness, and the only thing I could (or want to do) was indulge in self destructive behavior. I felt pathetic, and that feeling was truth according to my mind. I kind of just gave up on everything. And not in the content "letting go" sort of way meditation promotes.</p>
<p>This is also very common. Many people can attest to having a sort of love-hate relationship with practice. It's especially difficult when something appears that we want to avoid -- feelings of fear, sadness, vulnerability, uncertainty, for example -- and its especially difficult when we judge ourselves harshly.</p>
<p>This has to stop. It's very important not to think badly of yourself even if you do wrong action. This is where understanding of karma comes in. It's not a justification for wrong action, but it's an explanation of it. You may have to hear a thousand times that you are essentially okay. In fact, you are essentially a Buddha. That is what you really are. Ask this crap is just a thin layer covering up what you really are. But you have to believe in that. You may have to remind <em>yourself</em> a thousand times, or a hundred thousand times.</p>
<p>"I am Buddha. I am essentially good and awake. This is what I am returning to." Tell it to yourself. Understand it. Deepen faith in it.</p>
<p>When we do wrong action, it is not automatically necessary to feel shame and despondency. We can move on to the next thing clearly. This is an important function of many of the rituals of traditional practice: they give is a chance to be new again, to start fresh. The faster you can start fresh, the more you can transform your karma, your patterns. Moving toward mastery: quickly correct your mistakes, and don't linger in self-blaming, self-pitying drama.</p>
<p>Self-blame is a very interesting psychological dynamic. We make a deal with ourselves to feel bad in exchange for staying in the pattern. At some level, we allow ourselves to continue indulging in the bad action, and we make ourselves feel bad as payment. Be aware of this deal you make with yourself. Next time Shane and self-defeat appear, realize that it's a deal you're making with yourself to avoid moving on, avoid actually dealing with the situation.</p>
<p>If you are resistant to meditation, no problem. What do you like to do that is healthy rather than harmful? Do that. It's nigh impossible to just change habits in a vacuum; you need to replace them with something positive. When the impulse to act out appears for you, change the channel. Get out of that environment, get away from your triggers, and go do something else enjoyable. This is also beneficial. This is also spiritual activity. You don't have to meditate if you don't want to.</p>
<p>&gt;What sucks is that before I started meditating breaking down or getting hurt from other's actions would be very surface level. I.E. feeling bad about losing friends or having something done against me = sad feelings, nothing more. Now my emotional hurts cut deep, and seems to spring up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>If they are not faced and suggested, wounds can build up until we acquire a very reactive layer of self. Eckhart Tolle, among others, calls it the 'pain body'. It is helpful to be aware when the pain body is controlling our actions and reactions. You might like to read what Tolle says about it in <em>A New Earth</em>.</p>
<p>Best wishes. Remind yourself: "I am essentially good and awake. I am Buddha." Very important.</p>
<p>See you on the path.</p>
