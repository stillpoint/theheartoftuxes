  <h1>Thoughts on current meditation practice & technique for newbie? Too intense?</h1>

<p>Hi Gojeezy. Thank you for your questions. I trust you are not attacking me.</p>
<p>I don't feel I make that claim often. I do recommend that people study with teachers quite often, though.</p>
<p>It's hard to say who the ideal teacher would be. At first glance one might think that a lineage holder would be best. You're getting the pure download, so to speak. In Buddhism, this means you're sitting with someone who has attained Buddha's mind. But sometimes we need someone more attuned to our level and milieu, more available in causal circumstances, or someone who reflects — for better or worse — a particular stereotype we hold. Someone can be a gateway to practice without necessarily having the highest attainment or best ability to convey it.</p>
<p>I might use the word 'teacher' in different ways. It is important not to get too wrapped up in definitions. Usually when I recommend that someone spend time with a teacher I mean someone who has learned not only a method very well, but also the method's place within a life practice, and its function — the intended results as well as the kinds of effects it produces, and the signs of its attainment. The teacher should know these things not just theoretically, but through personal experience; and ideally that personal experience has been well checked by <em>her</em> or <em>his</em> teacher or teachers, to weed out misconceptions and fill in blind spots and weak points.</p>
<p>I also usually state that the method should be a proven method, not just based on theories and studies but actually tried and true as evidenced by the attainment of many practitioners. This usually means a traditional method.</p>
<p>Some traditional methods stand out as very appropriate because they have been originally conceived by enlightened beings, and have been preserved and elucidated by a stream of enlightened beings, and further practiced very sincerely and deeply in devoted practice settings. In this day and age of dumbed-down infographics and rampant misinformation (can you say 'fake Buddha quotes?'), the preservation of profound teachings and practices in this way becomes precious beyond all ability to express.</p>
<p>We can encounter many beings who lead us toward truth. For a person with a meditative mind, there is nothing that is not a teacher. But this is because the person is very stable in equanimity: they can use both positive and negative examples as guides. For a less stable, more attached person, and especially for the many, many people in this world whose initial encounter with practice is dramatized in TV shows and movies or disembodied in podcasts and books, it becomes very important to have a dependable beacon — a being who can consistently embody the view beyond ego.</p>
<p>As many times as one's attachment overcomes the view — and that usually amounts to uncountable thousands of times over many years — one's true teacher is available to bring one back to it, without letting their own opinion, speculation, and habit cloud the teaching. (Or if it does, to consistently be able to catch it and correct it immediately.)</p>
<p>&gt;<em>There are a lot of stories that involve leaving society, perfecting oneself, then returning.</em></p>
<p>If one has exceptional, one-in-a-hundred-billion, merit then yes it is possible to leave society and perfect oneself by oneself. But these historical figures all themselves had teachers. The Buddha is recognized to have practiced profoundly and tirelessly for countless lifetimes before leaving on his own; and even when he did, he still studied and practiced with a group of ascetics (and those still alive at the time of his enlightenment later became his first disciples).</p>
<p>In any case, perhaps we shouldn't take the traditional, legendary story of the Buddha's life in a mere literal, fundamentalist way. As a veritable prince, he likely had all kinds of instruction in the ideas of his time and culture.</p>
<p>Jesus displayed a tremendous knowledge and command of scriptural teachings at a young age. Whether he was taught by flesh-bound beings or by forces common people can't perceive, there was a transmission.</p>
<p>Zarathustra was recognized as divine at birth, was protected by angels during childhood, and yet studied for many years before going off on his own.</p>
<p>Before monks are monks, they are monks-in-training. Before that, they are novitiates. Before that, they go to the temple or school. There is a basis, a foundation upon which leaving home makes sense. With the proper basis, there is nothing more beautiful and wonderful than a person devoting her or his life selflessly to the embodiment of truth. <em>Without</em> a proper basis, renunciation easily becomes self-indulgent isolationism, or a shaky, wavering waste of time and effort.</p>
<p>There is a cause and effect to the conditions of study, and so there is a proper order to 'leaving home'. It's not that there is no benefit. But for someone who is not stable in correct motivation, it is very easy for wrong views to continue, and in fact grow.</p>
<p>I am not at all discounting solitude. Even for the common layperson, solitude is a basic need of life as well as an important support for the spiritual path. It should just be in balance, and in the proper order.</p>
<p>While many people are attached to appearances ("excited, as though they were at a parade", as Lao Tzu says), sometimes we are also attached to stillness, and to the opportunity to keep things in our favorite way. The benefit of solitude is the space it provides for greater possibility and the depth of stillness and introspection it can support. The shadow of solitude is our use of it to avoid changing, avoid letting the world in. Alone, we are the boss; whatever style we prefer, we can have. This is not the ideal situation for paring down ego attachments. So it's best to have a clear, strong, stable, correct aspiration and practice habit in place before seeking long periods of isolation. For those who do have clear aspiration and clear practice, of course, their isolation can be of tremendous benefit not only to them but to the world.</p>
<p>Since you ask, I was indeed keying on the OP's communication and speaking to him as well as to those readers in similar circumstances or mindset. We've backtracked a bit in our more recent exchange.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>This happens when the renunciate reintegrates back into society.</em></p>
<p>Yes, reintegration is key. How does it go? Is there basis for it? <em>Re</em>integration implies some degree of original integration. Leaving behind unfinished business is not ideal for a monk or other renunciate. Of course, we will all have our flaws and habits; and if we let mundane details get in the way of spiritual pursuit we may never find the opportunity to dive fully into practice. But if someone has not fulfilled certain steps of maturation — not learned how to take care of his body, not learned in a basic way how to negotiate her emotions, not developed socialization and the ability to consider others at even a primitive level — then isolation will not be a healthy situation. So, some people become monks at a very young age, even as toddlers; but they go to the monastery to be taught and socialized, and to develop a basic human framework and a stable practice framework... and <em>then</em> they are prepared to go on their own and be responsible for their own practice without drifting and wasting the opportunity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we often see people going into isolation without having done the requisite personal work, and then they find reintegration in society extremely difficult and problematic. This is because they did not have the capacity or will to work on their own blind spots and attachments.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If an individual's current situation reinforces their conditioning do you think it would help to leave the situation, pacify their conditioning, then reintigrate back into the previous situation?</em></p>
<p>Maybe you should turn this into a statement instead of a question.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll answer. It depends on the basis — on the stability of the individual. It depends on the 'center', which we call 'Dharma Energy'. If one's Dharma Energy is strong, then it is of great benefit to work through difficult conditions. If one's Dharma Energy is weak, then conditions control one's mind, and regulation of external conditions makes a great deal of difference toward progress.</p>
<p>So if Dharma Energy has not yet developed, it is indeed important to either improve or leave negative conditions as soon as possible. How soon is possible depends on karma. If one has not created the causal basis for leaving negative conditions, one will have to linger within them. Then the only way is to practice — to create positive causes, positive merit, and Dharma Energy — and wait until the situation turns around or opens.</p>
<p>But if one <em>is</em> able to leave the negative situation, that is not to say that one's new situation will necessarily be better! Wise choices have to be made; and for the beginner, those choices often enough come from wishful thinking or secret or unconscious agendas rather than Dharmic view. Thus, a capable guide and an established practice setting are of singular importance at this stage of the path.</p>
