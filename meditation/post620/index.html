  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>A lot of people are in a similar situation. I encourage you to keep trying.</p>
<p>I was practicing on my own since I was very young. I first started studying with a Zen teacher locally, and did a course of training, several retreats, and a bit of residential training with him. But although he was a very wise teacher I was not satisfied with the style of practice, so I looked for a teacher and community I could commit to wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>I researched and traveled checking out communities in North America for about ten years. I won't get into that whole story, but I'll just say that when I finally found my true teacher it was like coming home. Even if I had searched for fifty years it would have been well worth the effort.</p>
<p>This was before the internet was a source of information on spiritual communities. I followed leads found in magazines and books, hubs like yoga centers or public talks, and word of mouth. I even checked the phone book (which is how I find the first Zen Center I ever visited).</p>
<p>There are now many resources out there. If you try, you can find a teacher. If they are within a couple of hours from you, you can visit fairly regularly. If they are farther away, you can take occasional trips to visit.</p>
<p>In the old days in East Asia, people would sometimes travel on foot for days or weeks to meet a teacher, but one meeting could prove life-changing.</p>
<p>I know how mundane life can swallow up even a sincere intent to practice. So many trivial or negative influences, so many distractions, so few role models of integrity. And our own habits and misunderstandings also turn us from the path so frequently. But this is important! Finding your true life is important! So keep coming back, keep trying.</p>
<p>Being taken away is a matter of karma (the results of your past actions). There will be many times when your karma covers up or diverts your better intentions. But when you are taken away, you can return. Keep returning. Let nothing defeat you. Sometimes you're temporarily down, but if you keep getting back up no matter what, your karma will change and the way will open for you.</p>
<p>You can also take actions to strengthen your connection to the path of truth. Making your living space and schedule supportive of practice is a way to help yourself in times when you otherwise might give up. Keeping some images within sight, representative of the ultimate aim -- peace, awakening, Dharma -- will make impressions in your consciousness that can keep you returning to the path. Daily rituals also have this effect.</p>
<p>You need to take the time and effort to research a prospective teacher and try out study with an open mind but not a blind one.</p>
<p>Before you meet your teacher you can still call out to them. Enlightened beings operate in dimensions and pathways we don't perceive and can't comprehend. Consider how you would want to help someone sincerely seeking peace and truth, then just think how much more responsive a boundlessly compassionate awakened being would be. So there is good reason to call on the connection and blessings of teachers even if they are not yet standing before you physically. This is another way of gathering the right conditions for your awakening.</p>
<p>And even before you find a supportive community and teacher you can do meditation practice and do many positive, compassionate actions. Since your current karma is problematic, occasionally making it difficult to connect with the teaching, it makes sense to change that karma. Doing good actions like spiritual practice and day-to-day acts of kindness and generosity create a bank account of good karma that will eventually open the way to a good practice situation, and enhance your ability to progress within that situation. Compassionate, positive action is the fuel that propels the vehicle of practice.</p>
<p>I believe that things don't happen by accident; they are caused. My great fortune in meeting enlightened masters is, I believe, a result of my own past practice and positive activity. Even if it is difficult, and even when it seems nothing is happening, your sincere efforts are building up unseen, growing until they reach a critical mass and manifest major change in your life.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One more thing: We <em>all</em> struggle. Things of value are seldom easily obtained. But the struggle itself is the path. Don't think that only the easy part is the path. In struggle you are defining your devotion. Trouble teaches you your resources, and calls them out. You can also love struggle as your true, precious teacher.</p>
