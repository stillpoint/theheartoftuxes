  <h1>How could I “watch” my drowsiness without falling asleep?</h1>

<p>First, what kind of meditation are you doing, and for what purpose?</p>
<p>Unless there is a particular reason the method requires it, you should meditate with eyes gently open. The aim is to awaken to reality, so we take the bodymind posture that is awake and accepting, which includes open eyes. This in itself will ward off some drowsiness, but ultimately we have to come to terms with the desire to sleep, just as with all our desires.</p>
<p>By the same token, upright sitting posture — awake and relaxed — is most helpful. Avoid lying down unless there is a specific need for it (as when doing relaxation practice, which is not meditation per se, or when injury prevents you from sitting up). Avoid slouching.</p>
<p>Next, you can consider the causes for drowsiness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you getting enough sleep, and is your sleep schedule regular?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a proper balance of work, rest (non-sleeping restful time), and exercise?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you eating a diet that makes you sluggish, or that overstimulates you and leads to crashing; or a diet that helps you be fresh and light? (For guidance on diet you might look into the yogic concept of the <a href="http://www.yogabasics.com/learn/the-3-gunas-of-nature/"><em>Three Guna</em>s</a> — the subduing, stimulating, and harmonizing influences in nature and in the food we eat.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you eating soon before meditating? After a meal, the digestive process uses its share of blood and energy, possibly leaving you less alert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is emotional avoidance or depression an issue? It often happens that sleepiness arises when certain feelings or subject matter call for our involvement. ("Can we have that talk now, hon?" "Not now, I'm so tired.")</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep is one of the Five Desires in Buddhism, which comprise Food, Sleep, Sex, Money, and Fame. These are the forces that draw us away from Dharmic activity, away from open awareness and harmonious relationship, and impel us to act habitually and unconsciously. Unless they are checked, the Five Desires increase over the course of our lives, controlling our behavior.</p>
<p>Sleep is one of the first desires to develop in our lives, and thus is one of the deepest. The desire is so deeply ingrained in us that many people, even many meditators, are hard pressed to differentiate between need and desire. At the first sign of sleepiness, the mind starts to turn away from practice and seek comfort, darkness, and the off-loading of responsibility. So if awakening is (correctly) your aim in meditation, sitting through drowsiness is very important.</p>
<p>If your effort is sincere, it is not wasted. Just don't judge your sittings. Only do it.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that you see how easily sleepiness can throw you off. It is appropriate that you see how easily thoughts can take you away when you don't have your ideal situation and condition. So then consider how you will access wisdom and compassion during difficult situations, or how you will keep your mind correctly when you are ill or dying. It is a bracing truth to be faced! There is much work to be done.</p>
<p>Some things that help you practice through sleepiness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation, aspiration. This is the single most influential and important factor. <em>Why meditate? Why live, and why do anything?</em> When the motivation is clear, tremendous energy is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is remarkable to see people practicing side by side in the same conditions — same food, same work, same sleep schedule — and some are flagging, while others are bright and sharp. Of course, personal constitution and shifting health issues have a lot to do with it; but motivation can make a huge, even miraculous difference. With clear, sincere motivation you can practice for many days with almost no sleep (a form that is required in some retreats that, in part, train your mastery over the desire to sleep). I personally know some monks and nuns who sleep only three hours a night, and yet are among the brightest, most energetic people I've met. One monk practices all night in meditation posture — his brain may experience micro-sleeps while he sits up, but they are almost certainly different in nature than our night-long sessions. During the day, this monk is extremely energetic, doing hard physical work without ever dwindling.</p>
<p>These people have accessed energy on a different level. When manipulation of the thoughts has been relinquished, when the self has been seen through, great burdens are removed. This is all rooted in motivation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awareness of death is one of the best ways to bring motivation to a clear focus. If contemplation of death or actual dying practice (death meditation) has been practiced regularly, life priorities are properly arranged and motivation is clarified. This allows the meditator to call on greater motivation at a moment's notice by recalling her/his inevitable and unpredictable demise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raising the eyes from downcast to forward gazing helps raise the energy. The eyelids are kept at half-open, but the eyes gaze forward instead of toward the floor three feet or so in front of the body, as usually instructed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the type of meditation being practiced, energy can be directed to flow or the attention can be applied to a higher <em>chakra</em> or <em>tantien</em> (energy centers) to stimulate wakefulness. This should not be tried without consistent, capable guidance and within the proper context of a method and path of training. One's own ignorance easily becomes ingrained when one dabbles with energy practices — the blind spots and misunderstandings get trained and strengthened along with the energy. But if you have a responsible teacher you can ask about sleepiness and he/she may assign an energy remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practicing with others is very helpful in overcoming attachment to drowsiness as well as many other attachments. It is almost impossible to overcome one's own patterns by oneself, but surrendering to a structure of practice in the company of others can achieve it. Furthermore, you can get both inspiration and energetic support from the practice of others; solitary streams join in a powerful river of practice that can transport you to attainments difficult or impossible gain on your own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
