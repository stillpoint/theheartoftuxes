  <h1>Waking up with a racing mind</h1>

<p>It's difficult to say what the cause may be without going into an involved history and diagnosis. There are all kinds of possible physical, emotional, mental, and lifestyle causes. The good news is that all these layers of being work together and can be influenced together.</p>
<p>A Traditional Chinese Doctor might discover some constitutional pattern or temporary imbalance contributing to the overthinking. What they call the Spleen and Heart systems are often implicated in racing thought. A yin-yang imbalance sometimes appears in this way as well, where there is not enough calming yin to last through the night, thus the active yang flares up. Changes in activity, diet, or emotion could all contribute to such patterns; it would take a professional to make the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens that meditation itself incites more wakefulness, and one may find oneself waking at night, for example. I haven't heard of this manifesting as sleep through the night with agitation in the morning, but I suppose it's possible.</p>
<p>It is very important to start your day right, with the right relationship to your mind and to the events of the day. How you start tends to be how the day continues to unfold. Remembering and acknowledging your highest aspiration and life purpose in the moments when you wake puts things in their proper order and context. So even if there is difficulty, that difficulty has a context and less of a death grip on your subsequent activity.</p>
<p>I know one Zen nun who teaches her disciples to “embrace Buddha" the moment they wake up from sleep. The heart-mind's embrace is accompanied by a hugging motion with the arms. It is a beautiful example of the type of context I'm talking about. The day is embraced; possibility is embraced; ease and difficulty are embraced; and your true self is embraced.</p>
<p>It's great that you identify calming down with sitting on your meditation bench. That's wonderful and fortunate to have that association. Sometimes maybe you can spend moments on the bench without an agenda, just sitting calmly without requiring anything of the moment. This will deepen the association of the bench as a place of solace.</p>
<p>When overthinking appears, there are a few common cures. In energetic terms, you want to balance the busy, flighty, up-in-the-head energy with grounding and calming influences.</p>
<p>Physical practice is in any case very important. Information-based modern culture has promoted an incorrect view of the spiritual path as something negotiated mainly by the thinking; and meditation is mistakenly understood as something happening up in the head. Morning bowing practice is performed in many various temples and meditation centers throughout the world, and for good reason: it is part of setting that proper context (of surrender to truth and standing up for oneself), and it has a very grounding influence. Bowing and other physical practice would, I'm quite sure, help you a lot with getting out of the head and into the body.</p>
<p>You may also do well to splash some water on your face and go for an early-morning walk, run, or bike ride when you wake.</p>
<p>When you are lying in bed you are vulnerable; it is an inherently weak posture, prey to the influence of dreaming. If you wake up with racing thoughts, realize that it will be difficult to deal with them from a place of integrity if you are lying down: the thinking/dreaming realm has too much of a grasp on you at that time. Much better to immediately and without question jump up, splash cold water, and engage in your predetermined activity, whether bowing, walking, or sitting in meditation. Don't even hesitate, but just jump up the moment you wake, even if it's early. That way you get the upper hand on your thinking mind.</p>
<p>Another practice possible in waking moments is “piecing the body together". It's a practice I recommend often, and I believe I originally learned it from Sakyong Mipham's writings. Even before opening your eyes in the morning, feel your hands and feet -- establish and deepen contact with physical reality. Let that awareness spread to the lower arms and legs, then include the entire limbs, and then eventually include the entire body in the circle of awareness. Sensations will come and go, and some parts will feel expansive or numb or “not there", but the main thing is to use your intention and attention to deepen your embodiment. You start the day conscious and self-possessed rather than lingering in dreams and dullness. This is also said to be a very good way to prepare for sleep.</p>
<p>Diet is also a big influence on thinking. Balanced diet leads to balanced mind. When the thinking or energy is agitated, calming, grounding foods can be a quick cure. A whole-grain drink or porridge can be settling. For stronger influence, heavier food like meat, and a bigger meal, will have a grounding effect. Avoid sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and under-eating.</p>
<p>For general grounding effect, let your actual movements find their foundation in the feet, and move more slowly and in a settled way -- move like a mountain. This can dovetail well with mindfulness practice throughout the day.</p>
