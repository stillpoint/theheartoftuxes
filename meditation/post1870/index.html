  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Don't make 'should'. Only try.</p>
<p>In regular life, try. At retreat, try. When you give your best effort there will be no cause for regret. If you don't saddle yourself with preset rules you can apply wisdom case by case and situation by situation.</p>
<p>It's seldom wrong to do a practice retreat. It benefits everyone. <em>It trains you to be clear in daily life.</em> If you don't do hard practice and stabilize your mind, daily life will only control you.</p>
<p>In retreat you will learn how to maintain your practice continuously, and you will be generously offered conditions ideal for your progress. Also, retreat is not that long. You'll return to your living situation soon enough, with everything that entails.</p>
<p>And on the tail end of retreat you should likewise not hold expectations and preset judgments of what will be acceptable. Don't waste the retreat experience by quickly returning to the judging, checking mind. Don't allow either pride or self-defeating blame taint your practice. <em>Be momentary</em>, and take care of what's in front of your face.</p>
<p>Just as a matter of practicality, one of the most common mistakes beginners make is letting imagination outstrip capacity. They often put more value in dreams than in plain consistent practice. When their dream doesn't match their experience, suffering results. But sometimes you have to get that experience of trying and either breaking through or falling short. That's one of the initiations to intermediate practice, that experience.</p>
<p>And falling short isn't failure unless you stop. If you fall short and continue, that is enlightenment. Enlightenment means never stopping in any set view or position: "the mind that alights nowhere." Only take care of the next step, the next moment.</p>
<p>There is no 'should'. Your life doesn't careen out of control if you go or if you stay. The important point is not these outer plans but how you keep your mind just this moment.</p>
<p>If you try, then you'll get some information. If you don't try, you won't know; you'll only have more guessing and fearing. The question is whether you will serve integrity by trying at developing a self-responsibility and becoming self-sufficient in regular life, or by trying at doing retreat. Neither one is necessarily wrong; and there are countless other alternatives as well (a bit of both... study with a local teacher... etc.).</p>
<p>At one month-long retreat I injured myself on the first day, and sitting was excruciating. But the retreat leader rightly insisted I be either all-in or all-out. I made a deal with myself to continue <em>just for the next minute...</em> And if the minute turned out to be too much to face (which it did), then to just continue for the next second or instant. It was the decision my heart could be at peace with. If I truly couldn't continue, I wouldn't blame myself, but neither would I give up without trying. I completed the entire retreat second by second. It was a great lesson.</p>
<p>Maybe ask yourself what you can truly be at peace with in your heart. But in any case, these outer decisions don't decide your life. Facing the moment does, regardless of where you are.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I feel that I should be able to meditate for a long time without distractions.</em></p>
<p>This is just guessing and imagining and applying an arbitrary rule. (Also, it's a thought, not a feeling.) It's the kind of pressure you don't need.</p>
<p>Once you've <em>demonstrated</em> that you can practice for an hour at a time repeatedly, then you can reasonably expect that day-long retreat regimen is doable. Before you've demonstrated the capacity, you just don't know. (Which is also okay; but don't fool yourself.)</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>How much credit do you give your mother for her long-time practice? I'd it worth giving more weight to her recommendations?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I'm hoping it doesn't need to be said, but: we're taking about a <em>guided</em>, formal group retreat in a traditional practice, right?</p>
<p>If the planned retreat has vague structure or if it's a solitary effort, you're likely going to slip into following your own preference rather than doing continuous practice. And somewhere inside you, you'll know that's the case, and that opens you up to self-deception or self-blame.</p>
<p>If this is really going to be a vacation, call a spade a spade; don't fool yourself. A retreat led by a capable teacher in a living tradition is quite a different story: there's less opportunity for escape (though many people avoid facing themselves and their practice even in retreat).</p>
