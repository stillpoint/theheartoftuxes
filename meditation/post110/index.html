  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Buddhism teaches that the <em>idea</em> of self is an illusion. Hinduism teaches that all form is illusory projection of one basic reality, like projected images on a movie screen. Other philosophies may have different interpretations; so it's important not to confuse them.</p>
<p>When we use the word 'car', we refer to a collection of parts working together: a chassis and body, four wheels, an engine, seats, and other necessary parts. Each part is itself a collection of substances in certain shapes: a body has panels of steel and paint; an engine has many moving parts; a seat is made of metal and plastic and foam and cloth in certain shapes; and so on. And if you keep looking you see that each substance of each part is itself a collection of particles and non-particle space: materials, molecules, atoms, quarks.... The more you look, the more you see that whatever we point to is a temporary gathering of parts. Originally, there is no 'car'. It only appears because we choose to define a relationship of parts as 'car'.</p>
<p>At one point the car wasn't there yet. The metal hadn't even been taken out of the earth; the design hadn't even been devised; the people who put it together had not yet been born. Then at some point, conditions converged and the car was assembled. And as anyone knows who has owned a car, every day it falls apart a bit more, and eventually it will return to its state of not being a car any more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 'car' is not a set thing. There are many different forms — so different that the line between car and not-car becomes blurred. Is it still a car when one wheel is missing? Is it still a car when it doesn't have a roof? Is it still a car when it runs on electricity rather than gas? If we continue in this way we may change every part of the original car, so that no original part exists. If that's the case — if there is no part that is essentially the car — then we can't say that the car actually exists.</p>
<p>And even further, what we call 'car' is not a stable thing. Although we use the word as if it refers to something continuously existing, an actual car could not function if it were only one thing: it depends on the constant circulation of gas and air (or other fuel), the movement of pistons and cams and gears and wheels... turning pinions, radiating lights, systems always in flux reacting to each other. If any of these suddenly became <em>only one thing</em>, set and stable, it would stop functioning; and all the interrelated parts would be affected. So the set, stable 'car' is only in our use of the word and in our thinking; the real thing we point to is always changing, changing, changing. Even the very makeup of what we point to — the atomic and subatomic particles — is in tremendous movement. There is no frozen snapshot that is a car; if it were frozen, it would not only fail miserably as a car, its atomic substance would not exist (the vibrations, energies, and interrelated forces would not be in play).</p>
<p>Therefore, at many levels there is really no set 'thing' we can point to. No car, no tree, no planet, no person. We see a world of things only because we have come to accept <em>words</em> as reality. <strong>Because we have a name for something, we think that the thing is like the name:</strong> <strong><em>solid, limited, unchanging</em></strong><strong>. But if we actually perceive what is happening, we soon see that everything is</strong> <strong><em>fluid, boundless,</em></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>ever-changing.</em></strong></p>
<p>It is amazing how easily we get trapped in our ideas, and how they determine our view of reality, of life, or ourselves. Discovering the unreality of 'things', many people then make the new idea that 'nothing exists'. But this, too, is mistaken. This, too, is an example of getting trapped by thought rather than perceiving clearly.</p>
<p>Because if you perceive clearly, you can still drive a car; you can still climb a tree; you can still travel around the world; you can still shake someone's hand or converse or fall in love. That's why when someone said "nothing exists", one Zen Master replied "Go drink cold water!" This is very clear! Don't think; only drink cold water. Then you'll understand the sense in which water exists or doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So <em>"self is an illusion"</em> means that we are trapped by words and concepts. Words and concepts keep us from seeing clearly the <em>fluid, boundless, and ever-changing</em> nature of reality.</p>
<p>But if we put down all concepts, we can perceive reality and we can use everything appropriately. No longer obsessive about preserving this false notion of self, we don't have to violently defend our opinions and preferences; we don't have to manipulate things to try to get our own way, or ignore and abuse what we deem of no use to us. The polarity of 'mine' versus 'yours' no longer controls us. We are no longer threatened by fear of death.</p>
<p>And yet we are able to use everything appropriately. Getting free of the illusion of selfhood doesn't mean we slip into some nebulous vacuum of oneness. We can still use words and concepts effectively — <em>more effectively!</em> — we just are no longer <em>trapped</em> by them. They no longer determine how we see things.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>But although there is no set thing that we can point to, there is a thing we <em>can't</em> grasp or define, which is real and eternal. It is a 'non-thing' thing. For instance, although your body is always coming and going, and although your abode and possessions and perceptions and experiences are always coming and going, there is one awareness of it all happening. That awareness has not been assembled like a car; it has not been put together. It was not born, and it is undying. This is the central point of all spirituality: the unchanging reality.</p>
<p>Here is a famous Zen poem on what changes and what doesn't change:</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Coming empty-handed, going empty-handed — that is human.</strong>  <br />
<strong>When you are born, where do you come from?</strong>  <br />
<strong>When you die, where do you go?</strong>  <br />
<strong>Life is like a floating cloud which appears.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Death is like a floating cloud which disappears.</strong>  <br />
<strong>The floating cloud itself originally does not exist.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Life and death, coming and going, are also like that.</strong>  <br />
<strong>But there is one thing which always remains clear.</strong>  <br />
<strong>It is pure and clear, not depending on life and death.</strong>    </p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Then what is the one pure and clear thing?</strong></p>
