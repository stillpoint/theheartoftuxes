  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>What a great reply. I'm inspired to read your inquisitive and balanced thoughts. This is important, to maintain the will to look into the unknown with fresh eyes, and to keep applying grounded reason. Sometimes reasoned process will turn you away from magical thinking and mere wishful fantasy; and sometimes it will take you <em>into</em> spheres of experience that are utterly, radically new to you. Even-mindedness, curiosity, and the courage to go beyond old ways of seeing are precious ingredients that work together. This is so, I think, whether the field is science or spirituality (and the two are sometimes overlapping now).</p>
<p><strong>Re. "Am I on the right path?":</strong></p>
<p>You don't need to know everything ahead of time. And you won't always know where you stand. Life is like that, and spiritual training is <em>definitely</em> like that. But you can give yourself 'a sporting chance' by looking into a proven tradition, and researching and trying out their teaching and practice. Wisdom traditions have been passed down by inconceivably great enlightened beings, in lineages of other wise and enlightened beings; and their teachings and methods have been tried and proven and in many cases refined or developed through the efforts of countless practitioners over centuries.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between blind adherence to religion and real transmission of wisdom. If you stay even-minded -- open without blindly accepting or rejecting -- I think you will be able to see the difference for yourself. But it does require you to take steps, to venture forth.</p>
<p>The best foundation for clarity in training is clarity in your life direction. This is a very big question behind everything you do; and it may take years (or lifetimes) to really clear it up: <em>why</em> do anything? We are born, we move about, and then we die. What is the moving-about <em>for</em>? Why choose one way of moving about rather than another? In Zen this is called <em>The Great Question Of Birth And Death</em> or <em>The Great Matter</em>.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily something you come up with a final answer for -- at least, not immediately. But the willingness to ask, and to look into it, and to not be dissuaded by the discomfort of openness and unknowing, gradually clarify your life direction. Then maybe you get a life experience that brings it all into focus: maybe your parents or some of your peers die, or you suffer a great loss or close call, and you suddenly realize that life is very short and that your way is completely groundless and open like the night sky. Or maybe you meet a great being, someone who is consistently brilliantly clear, inconceivably grounded, astonishingly compassionate, unremittingly joyful, and whose direction in life seems perfectly clear and stable; and it makes you realize that this is not a pipe dream, and that this is not only <em>possible</em> for you, but that it is your true direction as well, your birthright, the full embodiment of your human life.</p>
<p>When you have clear direction in life, you are not pushed and pulled by circumstances. You can't escape circumstances, but circumstances don't have to determine your happiness or your compassion toward others. And this means that you won't be pushed and pulled around by the muddiness that sometimes appears in spiritual circles -- people who think they are special when they're not; narrow-minded teachers who have had a remarkable experience but haven't been able to integrate it; overblown claims; marketing that appeals to attachments.... When you know what you're on about in life, you don't take that bait, you don't believe that something outside is going to save you, so you don't need to worry about whether you're following the right path -- it will come clear soon enough.</p>
<p>That is why looking into the Great Question or Great Matter is the most fundamental basis for your good progress along the path. "I'm going to die soon. I can't take anything with me when I die -- no status, no knowledge, no possession, no relationship. How will I use my limited time and effort?"</p>
<p><strong>Re. Whether temples will emphasize commitment to certain religious or metaphysical claims:</strong></p>
<p>I guess the first point is that you don't find out unless you try. If you have fear but still try, then you have a chance to confirm the fear and choose another path or reveal the fear to be unfounded and liberate yourself from its effect; you get real-life experience. If you have fear and <em>don't</em> try, then you only have fear, no real-life experience.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, we can sum up the process of training thusly: we trade our idea for experience.</p>
<p>"I think..." or "I suspect..." is not in the same league as "I have experienced...."</p>
<p>And though there are many good paths, Buddhism in particular emphasizes this. The nature of Buddhist teaching is described as <em>ehipassiko</em> in Pali language: "come-and-see" (literally, "come-see-ish"). Although there is definitely a teaching passed on by wise beings, the fruition of that teaching is that you see its truth or falsity for yourself -- not in opinion or speculation or seemingly reasonably theory, but in actual direct experience, beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>If a school or temple or teacher doesn't invite you to see for yourself, it's missing a key aspect of Buddhism. You might still hear what they have to say, but you don't have to commit to it.</p>
<p>In fact, you probably <em>shouldn't</em> commit to it. Your commitment ought to grow in alignment with your experience. When you've listened and tried enough to take the next step, you take the next step. When you see for yourself that a teacher's actions match her or his words, then you may have enough faith to sensibly take a small step forward in commitment. People who jump in bravely and with good intent but without grounding in experience tend to fall off the path quickly.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Western "clinical" adoptions seem to market meditation as nothing but a stress-ball</em></p>
<p>Yes! That's so fortunate that you can perceive that. I'm so happy for you, that you are able to move into a deeper view.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I can only imagine telling my family and friends that I'm taking a break from civilization and going off on a three-month isolated retreat; most of them would be utterly perplexed as to why anyone would want to do such a thing</em></p>
<p>First of all, a three-month retreat is not your first step. It would be a very rare person who jumped in like that (and was allowed to); and that person would likely be so clear in their commitment that concerns like this would be of absolutely no consequence to them. Your gateway is likely more along the lines of going to a public talk or two, or taking an introductory class, or maybe attending a service and then talking with a monk or assistant teacher.</p>
<p>You are interested in the mind, so why should people begrudge you an investigation into mind? It is their own limitation, their own ignorance and suffering that gets in the way and causes them to scoff. (It recalls the line from the Taoist master Lao Tzu: "If they didn't scoff, it wouldn't be the Tao." If they didn't feel uncomfortable and laugh at the prospect, it wouldn't be the Great Matter.)</p>
<p>So how can you help them?</p>
<p>Sometimes at a wedding or party, people will scoff at the music and the prospect of dancing and the cheesiness of the decorations or whatever; but once someone lets loose and starts to enjoy themselves without inhibition, everyone joins in and experiences the mutual joy. How much more so in the case of these deep issues of life and death, and meaning, and value, and happiness: everyone's caught up in triviality, but everyone's secretly waiting for <em>someone</em> to speak sincerely about meaningful things. We crave it, we need it. It's like food to us. Just, some of us don't <em>know</em> that we crave it. Some of us don't know that everything we try in life is an attempt to win back our own true mind, our own true life.</p>
<p>Everything comes back to this one point. All suffering arises because we don't understand our true self.</p>
<p>I think you may be very interested in Joan Halifax's life work. She's a Zen Master and priest who is also a PhD in Medical Anthropology, a Psychology researcher, a writer and shaman and tireless worker for the dying, oppressed, and suffering. She has been at the forefront of scientific investigation into spiritual insights, and vice versa. And she's a very wonderful, kind, and razor sharp teacher. Look her up!</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Which tradition do you practice, if you don't mind me asking?</em></p>
<p>I like to remain anonymous online. I'd rather focus on significant and practical issues than talk about myself. I can tell you that I've trained in all three major branches of Buddhism, and have had some contact/study in eastern martial arts, energy practices, shamanism, as well as Hindu philosophy and yoga.</p>
