  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>That is all the dream of life. Practice is another thing altogether. So for five minutes at a time you must commit to letting go of these thought-dreams. Thought may come; you don't have to destroy it or push it away, but you mustn't follow it. Keep returning to your method, again and again and again, and don't take the bait. This is a strict commitment during practice. At meditation, don't play the game of trying to fix things through thinking. Be completely faithful to the method.</p>
<p>These thoughts you are having about the relationship are like a baited hook dropped into the water. Don't bite the hook, and you will be safe. But if you bite the hook you must pay the consequences.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people say "I care for her/him deeply" they really mean "I deeply want something from them". That is not love or caring; it is desire. Desire is part of our human situation, so as with thought the aim is not to destroy it; but it is necessary to distinguish between <em>your</em> desire and true care. If you care for the other person deeply, you will offer space, kindness, peace, even-mindedness, acceptance, open-handedness. You will offer your letting-go. Let go of your opinion. Let go of having things your way. Let go of expecting something from her. If you care about a person, you will do what is best for the other person's peace of mind, not what you hold in your opinion or what your emotional thinking prompts you to do.</p>
<p>Even if you are embroiled in emotion, at work you should take care of work. It will help everyone if you continue to act professionally and with integrity. Doing your job with professionalism in the face of this will help you avoid the pain and embarrassment of involving others (and their pain and embarrassment too). It will help the relationship return to neutral. And it will help your professional career and public image.</p>
<p>I am absolutely not condoning playing games. Strategizing to give someone the cold shoulder is immature. You can do better than that. Neither do you have to continue to be tied up and embroiled or try to look all nicey-nice. Just take care of each present moment with integrity. When your work is in front of you, do your work. When your lunch is in front of you, eat your lunch. When a person is in front of you, treat them with respect and follow the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>Next, why are you involving others in your problem with someone else? That's messy and backhanded and unnecessary. As Thich Nhat Hanh teaches, triangles are not a good relationship shape. If you have a problem with someone, it is up to you to resolve that problem with them; don't invite others into it. Since you've already done it, do what you need to remedy it. No need for self-blame, but determine to act with more integrity in the future. Let people know that you're trying to improve your relationships by not talking behind another's back or gossiping.</p>
<p>It's said that gossip hurts three people: the one the gossip is about, the one listening, and the one doing the gossiping. So this is clearly one reason why meditation is more difficult for you now. It is cause and effect. You created negative causes in your environment and in your own mind and heart, and the result is that you experience a disturbed environment and mind and heart. You have to change the causes. Plant seeds of integrity and positivity. Be generous rather than resentful, and your mind and life will calm down and go better.</p>
<p>You don't have to make a plan about what to do around someone. Instead, make an intention about <em>how</em> to relate; that is, to be civil and respectful and integral.</p>
<p>Finally, let's be aware that "she hurt me" is only the story you make about what happened. You've swallowed the hook here by following your inner dialog. You did your part in the unfolding of things; she did her part. How you choose to receive it and respond is up to you. If you cling to your story, healing will be difficult. You can choose peace at any time.</p>
<p>Please check the first part of the first verse of the Dhammapada [gender changed to fit your situation]:</p>
<p>&gt; We are what we think.<br />
&gt; All that we are arises with our thoughts. <br />
&gt; With our thoughts we make the world.<br />
&gt; 
&gt; Speak or act with an impure mind<br />
&gt; And trouble will follow you <br />
&gt; As the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart.
&gt; 
&gt; We are what we think.<br />
&gt; All that we are arises with our thoughts.<br />
&gt; With our thoughts we make the world. 
&gt; 
&gt; Speak or act with a pure mind<br />
&gt; And happiness will follow you<br />
&gt; As your shadow follows you, unshakable.
&gt; 
&gt; "Look how she abused me and hurt me,<br />
&gt; How she put me down and took from me."<br />
&gt; Live with such thoughts and you live in hate.
&gt; 
&gt; "Look how she abused me and hurt me,<br />
&gt; How she put me down and took from me."<br />
&gt; Abandon such thoughts, and live in love.
&gt; 
&gt; In this world<br />
&gt; Hate has never dispelled hate.<br />
&gt; Only love dispels hate.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the law,<br />
&gt; Ancient and inexhaustible.
&gt; 
&gt; You too shall pass away.<br />
&gt; Knowing this, how can you quarrel?</p>
