  <h1>How do you guys handle a tired meditation session?</h1>

<p>What's a 'good' meditation session?</p>
<p>Or maybe more to the point, what's <em>not</em> a 'good' meditation session?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Show me one thing in the world that is not medicine!</em></p>
<p>The limitation of your thought is what defines a session as good or bad. <strong>Your task in meditation isn't to concern yourself with the result, but to offer your best effort in the moment.
</strong>
When it's raining, things get wet. When you're out in the cold, you feel cold. When you're tired in meditation, your meditation has a tired quality. That's all. No problem.</p>
<p>If you commit to a practice, only do that practice. That is the only way you will be able to move beyond your current habits and obstacles. When we begin on the path, we are very conditional: our sense of things is very dependent on results; so we get pushed and pulled around by our habits and mindets rather than being able to see and act clearly. In order to move beyond this, we have to surrender our conditional nature. <strong>That is one reason why we commit to a schedule and structure of training. It is so that we can learn to be unconditional, like our original nature.</strong></p>
<p>So if it's time to sit, only sit; and do your best.</p>
<p>If tiredness appears because your life is not in balance, then bringing it to balance will address this problem. <strong>Improve your sleep schedule and quality of sleep.</strong> Cut out unnecessary stresses and attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Diet</strong> also can contribute to tiredness. Eating too many heavy foods like lots of meat or rich fatty food can bring an overall sluggishness. Eating sugars and refined carbohydrate foods, as found in many breads, snacks, and sodas, creates a blood sugar spike and rebound. When the body responds to a blood sugar spike, the sudden rush of energy becomes a sudden drop in energy. This can cause tiredness and dullness in sitting. Eating too much, or eating immediately before sitting in meditation can both cause drowsiness.</p>
<p>If there is imbalance in your <strong>physical activity</strong> it can lead to sluggishness and nodding off. Overexertion creates deep exhaustion over time, which can only be cured by taking better care of yourself and refraining from overextending. <em>Under</em>-exertion creates weakness and stagnation of body, mind, and energy, and your resulting feeling can be just as tired. You need to keep the energy moving, flowing, in your body, mind, and life.</p>
<p>Aside from issues of balance in lifestyle, one dynamic creates many of the dull, sluggish, tired experiences in meditation, and that dynamic is <strong>resistance</strong>. As you sit openhandedly, your inner life reorganizes itself. Deep-set patterns are freed to find their proper flow. Suppressed material bubbles up from the unconscious mind. The correct approach toward all of these movements is to continue moment-to-moment openhanded awareness: <em>don't touch</em>.</p>
<p>But the very fact that much of this material is — for us — unconscious and habitually ignored, denied, or suppressed makes it difficult for us to be aware of our unconscious and habitual reactions to it. In formal sitting meditation, we have put ourselves into a situation where we allow and face all kinds of new material (or new to our awareness, at least). We begin to come into contact with all the hidden and disowned parts of ourselves. Perhaps for some years or for most of our lives we have built up patterns of avoidance, but now we come face to face with the things we're not used to seeing and feeling. One of the ego's strategies, then, is to dim the awareness. "If we can't avoid the sitting, then let's avoid being aware", it says.</p>
<p>A sort of sub-category of this is lack of motivation or <strong>unclear motivation</strong>. When you are listless because things have started to become meaningless or hopeless, it is time to clarify your motivation. Why do meditation? Why bother to wake up and eat and keep yourself alive? Human life is a rare and precious opportunity to get clear and move beyond suffering. This point has to be very clear for meditative practice to have big energy. Unclear motivation means small energy for meditation and other pursuits.</p>
<p>Many meditators go through a phase or several phases where dullness and sleepiness seem to blanket the practice. It is often a sign that they are coming into closer contact with inner material that would otherwise be habitually suppressed or avoided. So persisting in meditation even when tired is no small deal. It can be a tremendous, transformative healing. It just doesn't <em>feel</em> spectacular. But the application of open awareness even through tiredness overcomes one of the deepest obstacles we have to awakening. The power that you attain with this practice is considerable.</p>
<p>The <strong>Five Desires</strong> or Five Attachments in Buddhist teaching are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attachment to sleep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment to food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment to sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment to money (power)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment to fame</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the categories of obstacles that most deeply control our thought and behavior. If you get free of these attachments you will be far beyond a common person, and you will be able to act with clarity and compassion in all kinds of situations. Imagine George Costanza from <em>Seinfeld</em>, elbowing past other people to make sure he gets a slice of cake. It's funny, but pitiful! That's what our mind is like in relation to these Five Desires. It's not a noble way of life, but it's our habitual way of life, unless we make great efforts to move beyond those attachments. That is why we commit to practicing even when tired: so tiredness doesn't control us, and we can develop the ability to show up for life and show up for others, independent of brightness or tiredness.</p>
<p>If your second sitting in the late afternoon is sluggish, it could be the time of day. You've been awake, you've done a lot with your action and thinking, you've engaged with many issues already; so it may not be the ideal time for feeling bright and energetic. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, if your <strong>Yin</strong> energy is deficient you may experience a sort of withering feeling later in the day, as the cool, supportive Yin energy in you has become too depleted by the heat and active energy of the day (like oil may get used up by a hot engine). The effect of deficient Yin may be something like the wilting of a flower when it doesn't have enough water. Eating more calming, nurturing foods like watery vegetables can gradually support the Yin. Taking more restful breaks and in general turning down the hot activity of your life can help. Don't 'burn the candle at both ends'. In extreme cases, herbal medicines and bodywork like acupuncture and certain massage therapies can help.</p>
<p>But you may also want to try <strong>meditation early in the day</strong>, when you first wake up. That is a good time for bright practice. Very early morning (3 - 5am) and midnight are also traditionally times when your personal energy and the earth's energy work together to make very bright meditation. One of the signs of this bright energy is the fact that many men get erections in early morning, even in their sleep. In spiritual traditions they will sometimes direct this energy toward awakening in meditative practice.</p>
