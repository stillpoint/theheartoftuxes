  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Thank you for your follow-up.</p>
<p><em>In one very particular sense</em>, focusing on 'you' is Zen; but you have to be extremely clear on what that means. It doesn't mean 'me time', as in just hanging out alone. It means looking into the very basis of who or what you are — your own mind; that which perceives everything; that which is at the center of all experience.</p>
<p>In this sense, trying to find 'me' could be considered Zen, or one type of Zen practice. But very few people can do that practice at first without getting sidetracked and latching onto things other than the basic mind: they follow all kinds of other mental and energetic objects that arise. Only if the aspiration and capacity are appropriate would this self-inquiry practice be assigned. Most other initial practices offer more of a structure to train the concentration while still maintaining the Zen non-grasping attitude</p>
<p>So instructions are offered to</p>
<p>(A) Set the proper context: What are we trying to achieve, and why?</p>
<p>(B) Provide the proper entry: How do you begin? What do you do with your body and mind? What steps are taken, and in what order?</p>
<p>(C) Provide the proper support: What is important to remember, and what is not? How do posture, breath, attitude, environment, ritual, relationship, study, and lifestyle enhance or detract from the aim?</p>
<p>(D) Teach conduct based on innate wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>(E) Develop the conception, deepen the view of reality in its countless specific manifestations, by showing how the meditative experience unfolds in real-life situations.</p>
<p>(F) At a certain level of attainment, teach the practitioner how to teach.</p>
<p>You can certainly start on your own, but from a brief overview of the fields of preliminary instructions (above) you can reckon the benefit of input from those who have traveled the path ahead of you, and who have experience and expertise in guiding others back to themselves, and who themselves have attained the unquestionable, unconditional view.</p>
<p>It's not that you should proceed on no guidance, but that you should proceed on good, established guidance, from a living teacher — a <em>vessel</em> of Zen.</p>
<p>As to books, it's okay to read primary sources; but don't make much of them. The more ideas you build up now, the more you will have to break down and slog through later.</p>
<p>The way most people 'study' zen books is not ideal. Most people enter with an acquisitive mindset — they want to get something, and their very act of reading is a consumption. Contrast this with the student who reads one fundamental phrase or point and, without attaching any discursive thought to it whatsoever, then puts the book down, and sits in Unknowing. Not thinking about it. Not trying to make sense. Not grasping for a concept or insight to put in their pocket. Not thinking of themselves as having or not having knowledge. Just sitting openly.</p>
<p>In this second case, the teaching can sink in to the deep consciousness rather than getting disrupted and perverted by the student's view, opinion, and preference. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/48gl6s/regarding_striving_causes_and_conditions_as_they/">It is like planting a seed in the darkness of the soil.</a> You don't open the soil and look to see what the seed is becoming, much less try to make it into something in particular. You let it be. This is the spirit of Zen study. And it is always, always, always digested through practice, through action, by sitting meditation, walking meditation, bowing meditation, chanting meditation, eating meditation, through sincere effort and beneficial action, and through keeping correct momentary, non-manipulative relationship in daily activities.</p>
<p>In terms of the kind of book that can provide an entry, I do very much recommend a book or online source with some commentary and instruction over, or in addition to, ancient primary sources. Unless the primary source itself has guidance about <em>how to perform what is being taught</em> (like for instance Dogen's <a href="http://www.rightviewonline.org/RVO_Pages/Pages_SelectedTchngs/Dogen_Fukanzazengi.pdf"><em>Rules For Zazen</em></a> or <em>The Emergence Of The True Dharma Eye</em>), the beginner can be at a loss or get sidetracked.</p>
<p>You should be careful not to mix teachings from different sources. It is not that some of them are necessarily wrong. I mean, there are good and bad teachings, right and wrong ones; but there are many good sources that offer complete teaching. It's just that the culture, language, context, methods, and way of conveying the methods differ from source to source; so mixing them leads to confusion in the mind and contradiction in the action. Choose a teaching from a proven source — a <em>lineage</em> of Zen, whether Chinese, Korean, or Japanese in origin (and there are now many great American teachers with authentic lineage) — and then have faith that the teaching is complete and that it will unfold in its own time. Follow that method, and don't tinker. Follow that teaching, and let it reveal itself gradually through your practice rather than questioning it by shopping around at other sources. In some months of practice you will have a basis for considering whether it is a path you want to commit to.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, find a living teacher. If you get established in your own conception of practice, having followed a book or online source, you will face the doubt and difficulty of again having to change some habits and views when you begin to learn the new form and method offered by the live teacher. Your self-centered habit of like and dislike may even persuade you that the teaching is shallow or wrong or rigid; but this is mostly because your habit mind doesn't <em>like</em> it, that's all. Good practice feels like an imposition. This is because it directly impinges on the habit mind, the narrow, entrenched sense of self. If it didn't feel like an imposition, it wouldn't be affecting the selfish view, and wouldn't have any truly transformative effect on your life.</p>
<p>So before your own views and habits become too set in their ways, seek out a live teacher who can see you, and transmit directly to your mind, and respond to you.</p>
<p>Basic instructions abound on the net, often provided by practice centers. You might find a center near you and check their website to get an introduction to try out before you visit. Again, each center will have its own form and its own way of teaching that form; it doesn't necessarily mean that one way is right and the other wrong.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of online introductions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kwanumzen.org/getting-started/how-to-practice/sitting-meditation/sitting-forms/">Instructions from Korean lineage</a></p>
<p><a href="http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/practice/zazen/howto/">Instructions from Japanese lineage</a></p>
<p><a href="http://chancenter.org/cmc/chan-practice/how-to-meditate/">Instructions from Chinese lineage</a></p>
<p>Philip Kapleau's classic <em>Three Pillars Of Zen</em> is one of the few books that goes beyond commentary <em>about</em> Zen to give fairly extensive introduction on the nuts and bolts of sitting. Kapleau was not considered a fully achieved master by some, but this work is nevertheless a serviceable introduction to one style.</p>
<p>Avoid Sekida's books and teachings, which are particularly manipulative in nature.</p>
<p>The instructions may be similar in many ways, but don't assume that they teach the same thing. That is, don't mix and match, but choose one source and let it sink into you.</p>
