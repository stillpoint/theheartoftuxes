  <h1>Does anyone practice sound meditation?</h1>

<p>A teacher would be concerned about the reason you're switching: is it because the method is faulty or because your understanding, motivation, or application is faulty? If it's the latter — and I'm not saying it is — then just switching methods may not produce any benefit: the basic flaw could persist, and switching would only serve to distract you from the real cause of your difficulty. But maybe you understand this, and maybe there is some synergy for you with sound. I would just want to check carefully first whether understanding, motivation, and application have all been squared away.</p>
<p>Many monks and advanced practitioners that I know occasionally study with different teachers and different styles. They don't abandon their core practice, but they see it as an expression of their basic stability that they can take on any valid practice and perform it wholeheartedly, without reservations, without complaint. This is a reversal of our usual habit of picking and choosing, in which we tend to think of difficulty as 'wrong'. We think we should always have our favorite way.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of sound work is that sound is reaches us in many different places and states. Even from within a closed room, we can hear sounds from outside. Even from within sleep, we can hear sounds from waking life. So sound work is not at all dependent on recordings or special situations.</p>
<p>Also, sound work is not necessarily only tied up in sound. Really it's about the listening faculty, which doesn't depend on the appearance of sound. Whether there is a sound or whether there is silence, the listening faculty perceives both. Even if sound is completely removed, your listening is still there.</p>
<p>It is the listening, unattached to its object, that is practiced. If you <em>depend</em> on the object of meditation, you lose yourself in the world of objects. So we receive instructions like 'don't flow out through the senses'. Don't lose yourself chasing after appearances, whether they are sense objects or thoughts. In Taoism, this is called 'remaining at the center':</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Just stay at the center of the circle</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>and let all things take their course</em></p>
<p>Your goal of having a life of enjoyment is fine — not good, not bad. The reason certain studies and practices are recommended is that if you are <em>not</em> living in alignment with reality, having a life of enjoyment is not possible. One comes into happy relationship with things-as-they-are. If one tries to force things to go according to one's own concept, opinion, and preference, then suffering appears not only for oneself but for others. This is the root cause of inner turmoil, family strife, community disconnection, and world war. So the true nature of reality is not a separate issue from your own contentment.</p>
<p>But you are right that if you just practice resting your mind comfortably you may come around to more profound motivation. The poison to be cautious with is the acquisitive, self-centered attitude — what Shunryu Suzuki Roshi calls 'the gaining idea'. If you hold a gaining idea in life or in practice, problems will appear; it is simple cause and effect. The self-centered mind is illusory; it can't perceive things as they really are, and so it can't have a proper relationship with things as they really are. "I want..." poisons all efforts. The mind becomes narrow and rigid, like clothes that are too tight, or like being sealed in a cramped cage. "I want this... I want that...."</p>
<p>The self-concerned mind goes after what it wants, but can never hold it for long; it tries to avoid what it doesn't want, but can never avoid it for long; and it fails to live with what is neutral, because it ignores that whole area of real life. This is the cause of dissatisfaction. So if you want to enjoy life as much as possible, coming to terms with reality in a mature, noble, accepting way — not a childish grasping way — is absolutely necessary. It is clear cause and effect.</p>
<p>I recommend two practices for you, based on what you have told me about your interests and difficulties.</p>
<ul>
<li>For sitting meditation, I recommend <strong>mantra</strong> practice. You can do it just sitting still, or you can use a <em>mala</em> (a beaded rosary, either wrist-size or necklace-size), working it in time with the repetitions of the mantra. This will give you a very clear object to return to, so it will train you in Śamatha. Any time your mind goes away chasing any kind of event or thought, bring it back to the mantra. Very simple. This is Śamatha. You can use almost any popular mantra (the main thing is that you are returning with attention); but if you need a suggestion, <em>Om Mani Padme Hum</em> is perhaps the most famous and most commonly used around the world. Just repeat that phrase and be aware of repeating it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, at any time during your sitting you can use your voice to help you. Just enjoying with your voice in a sing-song way is healing to the heart; it improves your mood. You can join any mood with vocal recitation of the mantra: angry mantra, sad mantra, joyful mantra, loving mantra, fearful mantra.... The mantra continues. Soon your mind and the mantra can become one, and you can feel very comfortable. If your thinking energy is very busy you can use your voice to help you, as you not only return to the mantra internally but also hear its external sound. Then when you want to be silent you can let go of the vocal part and just return to the mantra internally.</p>
<p>I think this is a very good meditation for you. It has sound work if you want it. It naturally trains the breath when you use your voice, without any special need to control. And it has a very clear object; so you will know when you've gone away (your thinking will overshadow or become more vivid than the mantra), at which point you can practice returning.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second practice I recommend is taking walks at a gentle pace, during which you <strong>listen openly</strong>. Try to reside 'at the center', letting sound move through you without attaching to any of it. There is no need to try to listen to a particular thing or to make sure you are hearing everything. No need to check. If you keep your listening soft and open, it will naturally include everything. The main thing is to gently stay aware through listening, without going out after things. This is a very pleasant way to walk. I recommend that you walk at a slow but natural pace — an easy saunter — although the practice can be done at any pace of walking, from snail's pace to power walking or even running.</li>
</ul>
<p>This practice makes use of your proclivity toward sound, but also trains you in non-attachment. It is a very enjoyable practice, and a key to enjoyment in many different areas of life. Once you get the gist of 'staying at the center', you can apply that to countless other activities, and you can live a life of enjoyment.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also do mantra practice throughout the day if you connect well with it. But it's a bit of a different style. You need to take care that you don't get so lost in the mantra that you can't function. For example, if you do the same style that you do for sitting (only returning to mantra, and disengaging with all other thoughts and senses) then you could walk across the street without being aware of traffic, for example. So this kind of practice has mantra in a less prominent, background, way. If you want, you can try this; but I really recommend the former two practices for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know how it goes, if you like.</p>
