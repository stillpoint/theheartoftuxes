  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>This is clearly disturbing you. So there are two different aspects to the issue for you: dealing with the truth and dealing with the disturbance. For some people, these are both dealt with by doing practice. If your practice is very strong and you have very strong faith in it, this is possible. But for many people, the two aspects need separate responses.</p>
<p>As to the disturbance, have you been checked thoroughly? If it's something you're very concerned about, you can even request tests that wouldn't commonly be given, just to relieve your mind. See your doctor, get some referrals, and go from there.</p>
<p>Next, talk to someone about your fears. Get them out. You already know that your work can cause you to get stuck in your fears. Going around and around in your thinking will do that as well. So letting those inner voices have their say and then moving on may help you find more space. Talk, write, make art, sing. Journal. Express yourself. Not to get <em>into</em> your thinking and wallow, but to move on. When you are expressing yourself sincerely, you are moving on.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a death café? These meet-ups are popping up all over. They're very simply opportunities to talk about death without stigma. A big part of the fearful energy comes from the <em>charge</em> of the topic, and the fact that it's all hush-hush, unspeakable in many circles. But it's a natural part of life and so it's necessary to be able to communicate about it — to be heard, and to hear others, and to learn.</p>
<p>When you can learn about the thing you fear, your fear can be transformed into wisdom.</p>
<p>If your mind still goes around and around in fear, soon the body's responses will follow. Once tension arises habitually and a certain chemistry becomes established, you may feel the anxiety even when you are <em>not</em> making thoughts. So you need to take steps to settle and ground yourself, calm your breathing, let go of your thinking, even out your brain chemistry, give your hormones a rest.</p>
<p>You may say "I can't help but think...", but that's not true. At some level you are holding and even chasing fearful thoughts, because you seek the control that thinking seems to give, even if it's fearful thinking. But the only way you will get the experience that letting go is okay and peaceful and right is to actually do the letting go. You get the experience <em>after</em> you let go. For a moment at a time, let go, settle down, and then you will get the confirming experience of "Oh, yes, this moment is okay. I'm just here right now." Then you can build on that experience. It can inform the entire issue.</p>
<p>If you need a stronger break from your thinking, find ways to 'change the channel': go for a walk, do something to get your mind off the topic, get physical. If your work is a constant trigger, would you like to at least consider whether another type of work or another place of work would be better for you? And for heaven's sake, since time is so precious <em>and</em> since you need to change the channel, go play with your kids or do other meaningful things with them. If you need more help, more intervention, see a counselor or therapist. This is a very common fear, and there are a lot of good strategies for dealing with it in a healthy way. Cancer care institutions frequently offer support groups that are there for not only patients but also their friends and families, and are open for you to attend indefinitely after the death of a loved one.</p>
<p>There is something that dies and something that doesn't die. You are identifying with the thing that dies. This is a mistake about who or what you really are. When the question of who you are gets resolved, this fear gets resolved.</p>
<p>So it is your own skewed thought, your own perspective, that makes problems. You see death everywhere. This is true, but only partly true. Death means life. Because something dies, something new appears. There is no new life without death; there is no movement, no child, no relationship, no love, no joy, without something changing form from one thing to another. So where you see death everywhere, someone else sees life everywhere. And someone else sees beyond life and death, to the thing that doesn't move.</p>
<p>So this is the other side, the aspect of dealing with truth. <em>First</em> you need to rectify the negative pattern; you need to keep your mind from taking over your life. But when you have a semblance of balance, it is also necessary to look into the great matter of life and death, and get clear on it. Better to do it now and make your peace with reality than to be too late and completely at a loss when death comes. This is a sacred practice. Sacred doesn't have to do with gods and spirits and other dimensions; it has to do with living aligned with truth and integrity. To no longer have a gulf between body and heart, and between heart and mind.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There are many fears that tend to get bunched into 'fear of death'. Fear of <em>pain</em> is a common one. Fear of loss of control. Fear of being nobody or nothing. These may overlap with the issue of death, but often they have a large field of play in our lives in any case.</p>
<p>Would you like to practice radical letting-go, to get used to moving on into the great mystery? There are many possible gateways to that practice.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>The Human Route</strong></p>
<p>&gt;Coming empty-handed, going empty-handed – that is human.  <br />
&gt;When you are born, where do you come from?  <br />
&gt; When you die, where do you go?  <br />
&gt; Life is like a floating cloud which appears.  <br />
&gt; Death is like a floating cloud which disappears.  <br />
&gt; The floating cloud itself originally does not exist.  <br />
&gt; Life and death, coming and going, are also like that.  <br />
&gt; But there is one thing which always remains clear.  <br />
&gt; It is pure and clear, not depending on life and death.</p>
<p>&gt;Then what is the one pure and clear thing?</p>
