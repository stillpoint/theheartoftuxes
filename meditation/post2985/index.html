  <h1>Where to start on my new practice of meditating.</h1>

<p>Good question! Yes, there are many reasons.</p>
<p>Practice isn't a rote, mechanical process of taking something in and spitting something out; it's organic and interconnected. The various levels of self reorganize and communicate with each other; and this includes the level of relationship and community. So the first point is that group practice includes the communal part of yourself, which you need to include in order to be complete.</p>
<p>Next, a big part of how you approach and digest the teachings comes from having the right role models. For example, even if you understand intellectually how you should behave, if your parents and family only modeled bad behavior it will be very difficult for you to follow what you know intellectually. Seeing how others overcome the same issues you struggle with is both educational and highly motivating. And having the example of people who have gone far in practice clarifies your life direction in grounded, lively, embodied ways that are not possible just through reading or practicing alone.</p>
<p>An extension of this is that we can work through karma very quickly in a community (if we have right direction and right practice). When you see someone else's pattern, you can take it to heart: â€œThere, but for the Grace of God, go I." You can learn from it; you can avoid mistakes that would otherwise sidetrack you for years or lifetimes. You can take up initiatives that you otherwise wouldn't be aware of.</p>
<p>Next, being in community -- and especially in a practice setting -- means your habits and opinions will come up against the habits and opinions of others. You can't only have your own way. Instead, you bump and sometimes clash, and you have to learn to put down your own opinion time after time. This helps you mature much faster. It trains the humility that is essential to your ability to take in the teachings and blessings. No humility: no teaching can pass into you.</p>
<p>If you were left to your own devices you would surely opt for what <em>you</em> like, and be limited by how <em>you</em> see things. So in that situation you may never get to see your own deep patterns; you can easily fool yourself into thinking that your <em>preference</em> is right training, and that your <em>comfort or opinion</em> is attainment. We see this a lot on these forms, where people who practice alone can develop huge egos and be blocked by the massive illusions they cling to. When you surrender to a group form, your attachment to preference and opinion becomes much more apparent.</p>
<p>So when you are comfortable on the outside, relaxing in your own favourite situation, your practice doesn't grow up well. Inside-comfort is not developed. But when the outside training situation is not so comfortable, you can learn how to let go of opinion, and so your inside-comfort develops. Then you can be truly independent, free to be clear and compassionate in any situation, not only your favorite.</p>
<p>Surrendering to a structure is necessary. There are many forms to choose from, but at some point you need to choose one and work with it. There is no liberation, no new life, if you keep holding on to your old perspectives. And I mean that in a real-life sense, not some airy-fairy ideal. You can't help yourself be well and happy if you are stuck in your old ways of thinking and relating. The group practice situation provides this opportunity for surrender and progress.</p>
<p>Even your pride can help you in a group. On your own, sometimes you want to change your method or take a break. Maybe you grab a coffee and read a book on meditation rather than actually <em>doing</em> practice. Maybe you sleep in because you think you need it. So sleep becomes your master. But in group practice, you only follow the schedule and method, so your habits can't control you. Your pride maybe makes you wake up with everyone else and do early morning practice together. Little by little you gain mastery over things that used to control you. Then you don't need the structure as much; you participate for other reasons, to train perfectly, to embody complete openhandedness, or to help other people in the group and in the world.</p>
<p>The last point I'll mention is more subtle and energetic, but no less real. The greater part of our lives exists below the surface. We influence and are influenced by each other in countless unseen ways. When you practice alone you only have your personal energy to rely on. Sometimes it is stronger, sometimes weaker. You have not yet connected to universal energy in a way you can make use of.</p>
<p>But in a group, energies flow together like a river. You may not notice it, but it is there, flowing. At times when you would not have the capacity to continue alone, the group river carries you along. At critical times approaching breakthrough, the energy of the group is available to you, to finish the task. By virtue of your practice together you create deep Dharmic connections that are more significant for your subtle consciousness than most family or romantic ties we find among the general public.</p>
<p>In short, group practice is the inestimably precious treasure of <em>Sangha</em>.</p>
