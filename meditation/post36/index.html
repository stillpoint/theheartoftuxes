  <h1>['deleted by user']</h1>

<p>What you're describing is normal, and common, but is indeed a wandering away from meditation into dreaminess. So you are right to return to the breath without judging, no matter what it is that takes you away.</p>
<p>You are experiencing a small part of the wondrous, mysterious, elusive, and inscrutable qualities of mind. Some manifestations are sharp and clear, others a bubbling jumble, and others yet a vague tidal blending of dreams... and there are countless other types of manifestations of mind. Your job is to keep your center, no matter what manifestations arise.</p>
<p>Of course, we will lose our center again and again. That is par for the course; it happens because of a lifetime (and longer) of formative causes. We can't just make it all stop once and for all.  So we get the chance to practice letting go. "Returning without judging" says it well. Develop the knack of returning with no residue, nothing in the attitude or thinking that sticks to the situation that is already in the past. Only go on to the next thing, the next breath.</p>
<p>You may be able to rouse yourself somewhat into more clarity. These things may bring more energy to a dull meditation: reconnecting with your aspiration to wake up; recalling your love and devotion toward the path or the teacher or your loved ones; and remembering your limited time in life. Balance in your life, and balance between physical practice and motionless sitting, can also contribute to balance in the mind. (Sometimes these things are a matter of freeing the breath and circulation. Walking, bowing, or other exercise might help; eating moderately, and not before sitting, might also help.)</p>
<p>But quite a large portion of the meditator's career involves just continuing through. Just keep going through all difficulty, all strangeness, all boredom, all magnificence. Never get stuck anywhere.</p>
<p>Until one is a meditator, maybe one can't know the warriorship that is embodied, the epic journeys traversed when facing one's own mind. We are not to get lost in dreams; and yet it happens. We aim to get free of the grip of thought; and yet we succumb to it. But this is wonderful: winning or losing doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether you get the best of your dullness this time, or whether it gets the best of you. Maybe for a few years this is what you have to face, because of your particular set of past causes. That doesn't matter.</p>
<p>What matters is that you try. It's not that trying gets you somewhere (although it inevitably does). It's that when you try you transform into someone pure. You embody sincerity and perseverance. You become a momentary Bodhisattva, shining in your practice even though surrounded by demons — the sharp, clear demons, the bubbling jumble demons, the vague tidal blending dream demons....</p>
<p>You write that it gets so that you are barely aware that thoughts are occurring. Yes, it leads you into subtle, misty territory sometimes. So there you learn how subtle and how determined you have to be to overcome that hindrance in your mind. And when it gets harder to return, you train your power to return in the face of difficulty. These problems are your life master teaching you how to be an unconditioned person, a person whose awakeness and compassion are not swayed by any outer or inner conditions. It's just that you have to actually travel that territory yourself before you can be called the master of it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In short, don't depend on anything. Don't depend on things being clear or comfortable or linear and logical. Only try. Only keep returning. Then your returning power becomes stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I went through a period of 2 or 3 years, where I would become drowsy and start to fall asleep any time I meditated. I continued to sit very regularly, but I also fretted about it, trying to find the cause, trying to find the cure. I looked at diet, lifestyle, psychological issues, physiology, posture... I questioned my determination and worthiness and practice.</p>
<p>Then one day when traveling I met the teacher at a foreign meditation center and had a private interview with him. When he asked if I had any questions, I told him about my problem falling asleep. He leaned in, looked into my eyes with great interest, and said "Oh! What's <em>that</em> like?" Somehow the invitation to look with interest rather than try to correct or arrange my mind sank in, and from that moment the sleeping pattern for the most part went away and was not a problem any more.</p>
<p>So it is valuable to avoid fighting yourself or trying to make a better situation in your mind. Don't try to <em>make</em> more clarity. Only apply yourself to the practice; only be sincere. As in my story, genuine interest or curiosity can be a huge help in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
&gt;Of course, we will lose our center again and again. That is par for the course; it happens because of a lifetime (and longer) of formative causes. We can't just make it all stop once and for all.</p>
<p>I don't mean to say that there is no end, ever, to our turmoil. We just can't expect that it will happen without effort or discipline.</p>
