  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Movement before your morning meditation would be very wonderful, very beneficial.</p>
<p>You can do a gentle warmup first and then vigorous movement practice like sun salutations or prostrations.</p>
<p>There are various options for the gentle warmup:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel the body wants to <strong>stretch</strong> right away, you can let that be your immediate mindfulness practice the moment you come to consciousness. As soon as you start to wake, bring awareness to the entire body — become embodied, come into the day grounded in your physicality. This is a wonderful ritual, and while you're bringing mindfulness to the body you can also remember your great intention — your higher purpose as a human, and why it is so miraculously fortunate to be able to wake up, to be gifted with one more day of life with which to follow your intention, and to have a body that can be the vehicle of practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either right in bed or on the floor, you can move gently and stretch mindfully. This is where you counter the risk of cold stretching; because you are not forcing the body into some imposed shape or activity, you are <em>listening</em> — attending to how the body wants to move, to the messages it's sending, the creaks and aches and weak spots, the structural limits.</p>
<p>Don't force, but rather listen. Don't try to push any stretch to anywhere near a maximum. If you push, you are approaching the limit beyond which harm inevitably happens; and as you approach a limit the body already resists and tightens. So do at most 75% of the limit — not the limit of what you expect or remember, but the limit the body is telling you about in the moment.</p>
<p>For instance, usually we are less flexible in the morning, and less flexible in the cold. While you can certainly take these and other factors into account, if you just listen to the body it will tell you "I'm only ready to move <em>this</em> much just now..." or "whoop — be careful with the hips this morning" and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another way of warming up is to <strong>go for a walk</strong>. It doesn't have to be long, and it doesn't have to be a speed-walk; but it should be brisk enough to get the heart beathing and the blood pumping. Deep breathing wouldn't hurt, if the air quality and temperature allow it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just getting outside early in the morning before most people are up is a very nice ritual. You can be with the world, you can feel the light dawning in the sky and in you, your mind can be wide.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A third way of warming up is to do some <strong>gentle repetitive movement</strong>. Many Taiji and Qigong movements are appropriate for this. <strong>Swinging Arms</strong> exercise is very healthy, even as a practice on its own, and constitutes a great, gentle warmup. 5 or 10 minutes is usually enough for a bit of a morning warmup; and many health benefits can be derived from practicing it for 15 to 30 minutes at a time. It's a classic preparation for energy work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a stance with feet about shoulder-width apart and parallel (a line from mid-heel to second toe points straight forward).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sit down a bit, softening the ankles and knees, and letting the pelvis relax. Instructors sometimes say to 'let the tailbone drop'; that is, don't lock or hold the pelvis, but let the waist be loose and the spine long and relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the arms hang down, palms facing inward toward each other. Begin a small swinging arc with the arms relaxed, and gradually let it increase until the arms swing freely with the hands coming up to about shoulder level. The palms should be facing each other, hands relaxed (they will naturally form a cupped shape); and the arms should be tracing parallel paths rather than coming together or apart at various points in their path. All this means that the arm is swinging as a very free pendulum in its socket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the least effort possible to keep the arms swinging. Just bring them up with the smallest effort, and then let them drop by their own weight. So each swing is an opportunity to drop holding, drop doing, drop making, drop whatever has been clinging from the past, drop old patterns and mindsets.... In a very, very, very simple way, dropping everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the arms swing, the body will sink and rise a little because the soft knees allow it, and will also rock back and fort a little as a counterbalance to the swinging. From the very beginning, the breath should be smooth and full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can manage it, use your relaxed belly to draw air in through the nose, and then smoothly transition to breathing out through the mouth. Long, relaxed, smooth breath. Smooth transitions. At every opportunity, let the weight sink and relax and let go of holding or making. What a fantastic preparation for meditative physical practices or sitting meditation!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are ready to finish, begin to taper down: only swing half-way to shoulder height (45º) for a few swings, then half of that, then just tiny arcs, and then just rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are sick or weak, you don't necessarily have to forego arm-swinging, as it helps move energy, release blockages, oxygenate the body and brain, and move the process of illness along more speedily. Instead of taking full swings you can do a few minutes of ^1/2 or ^1/4 size arcs. The principle is the same as not stretching to your limit: honor the body by going gently and only doing things to about 75% of capacity. Exert yourself to 75%, not draining every last iota of energy. Eat to 75%, not stuffing yourself to the point where nothing can move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One last way of warming up is to use <strong>external heat</strong> in the form of a hot water bottle, hot bath, sauna, or heat lamp. One popular healing path from East Asia claims that most disease takes hold in coldness and stagnancy; so if you can keep yourself warm and exert yourself enough every day to break a sweat it supposedly helps you be vital and ward off illness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some health experts caution against too-frequent hot baths, first because they say chlorine and other substances can be absorbed, and second because men's sperm (and thus their root energy) is adversely affected by the heat.</p>
<p><strong>Vigorous, rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath movement</strong> is an exceptional meditative practice. <strong>Prostration practice</strong>, for example, is very healthy, it brightens and clears the mind, it takes buzzing and blocked energy (from overthinking) down out of the head and into its proper home in the lower belly, and it is a fantastic preparation for sitting meditation. <strong>Sun Salutations</strong> have very similar effect, as do <strong>Hindu Squats</strong>.</p>
<p>Before you do any vigorous exercise you should add some energy to the body. <strong>A cup of pure and very warm (almost hot) water</strong> gives the body two essential supports: water and heat; and it confirms your support of your being. Rather than immediately placing harsh demands on the body, you offer it some nurturing first.</p>
<p>Some people like to add some lemon and honey to the water, or apple cider vinegar and a bit of maple syrup. Turmeric or cayenne could also be added to either of these. Some people like spicy ginger tea upon waking and throughout the day; and this too can be taken plain or with lemon, honey, and in colder conditions perhaps with some phlegm-clearing spices like coriander seed, clove, cumin, and/or the very warming cinnamon.</p>
<p>The water can heat up for your drink as you heat up your body in the warmup. Then once you have done your brief warmup and taken your nurturing drink, you can do the vigorous movement practice and then immediately sit down to meditate.</p>
<p>After sun salutations or prostrations, the bodymind is very ready to sit! I'm sure you will benefit greatly from both the nurturing care and the strong movement of breath, blood, and energy; your meditation will be very settled and you will be more inclined to let go within the feeling of care and safety you have created. It is magical to proceed in profound meditation, with that very settled, comforted, clear aura as the light comes up in the sky and the creatures of the world begin to go about their day — your mind a pillar of stillness around which the universe turns.</p>
