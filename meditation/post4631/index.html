  <h1>Newbie here with a few questions...</h1>

<p>Not exactly "decide", but look into, and know. You can decide in a moment, but it won't necessarily be right or full. Looking into and clarifying your life direction may be a lifelong process, but it is a valuable one.</p>
<p>When you have gone beyond self-centered mind, there's no particular purpose to life. Life unfolds, as-is; and because you have gone beyond self-centered mind, your activity is appropriate and compassionate and beneficial to all. But we have not yet attained that, so we <em>do</em> have a purpose: to wake up from the dream of life, save ourselves, and save all beings from suffering.</p>
<p>This is a 'direction' rather than a 'goal' because it unfolds differently for everyone. You can't predict or decide how it will happen; you can only decide to be sincere and to have integrity in the way you encounter your everyday life. Having a correct relationship with the present situation, whatever it is, is 'correct direction'.</p>
<p>You don't have to think about where you fit in. You are not necessarily the one to know. You can't see your blind spots (that's why they're blind spots); and your small mind can't necessarily see the activity of your wide mind. So you won't necessarily know how you're doing. Perhaps a very clear teacher can see better than you can.</p>
<p>So your job isn't to think about or define where you are. Your job is to show up, openhanded. Show up for... whatever. When you show up without holding anything whatsoever, your own wisdom can go into action. That is why the practice is sometimes described as (1) put it all down and (2) follow the situation. Putting it all down is your compass; it is what causes you to find your correct direction. Following the situation is what allows your wisdom mind to function in harmony with life.</p>
<p>Right now, because you haven't had much practical experience, you are trying to understand practice conceptually. Many people think that's the only way to understand things. But really it is an inferior, very limited way. Often necessary, but certainly very limited. Especially when talking about practice, which is beyond thinking, trying to understand through concepts is insufficient.</p>
<p>So for instance you ask about deciding your direction, and you ask about various possible meanings for 'putting down'. You are seeking a label or idea to pin it all down. I'm afraid you can't grasp it that way. Even if I explain very well, you can't understand that way. <em>Doing</em> is understanding. You can have an idea of how a cookie is made and a label for how it tastes, but you will only understand a cookie well by eating it. Eating the cookie is better understanding than a hundred books written about it.</p>
<p>So putting down means putting down. You already know what it means. It is very simple. If you are holding a pencil, putting it down means you put it down and let it go. If you are holding particular view, drop it. Any holding, making, or wanting is to be put down.</p>
<p>This is a bit different than "don't become attached". "Don't become attached" makes a plan about the future. We don't know what the future will be. But what we do know is that the future is not here and now. The future is not alive, and not real. We are only dealing with reality. Very pure practice; very pure understanding: just this moment. Just now. So just now, put it all down. Attachment thinking may come up again. If so, you will then put it down again. It may come up ten thousand times. No problem; only put it down in the present moment. Okay?</p>
<p>So we don't try to make a particular outcome. We don't try to manipulate emotions. We don't check 'how we're doing' in comparison to others or in comparison to some idea we have. Only action; only doing it, in the moment.</p>
<p>So in meditation, only follow the method (given that you are using a valid, proven method, and that you understand it very well). In everyday life, only follow the situation.</p>
<p>True meditation is the mind that doesn't move. Like a mirror, it is still. Like a mirror, it reflects what appears before it. If the taste of a cookie appears, the mirror mind reflects sweet cookie taste. Very simple. So while the whole world appears within that mind, it is very plain and simple, not special. Like tasting cookie. Maybe go eat a cookie, then you will understand. Cookie taste is real, and boundless, and ungraspable; but it is also very, very simple. Just cookie; nothing special added.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I like the suggestion jimjamjello made about focusing on the feeling of my breath rather than trying to visualize it..... And I think I'll keep my eyes closed for now, but I like what you said about not withdrawing into my world.</em></p>
<p>Liking and not liking are <em>not</em> correct basis for meditation. Meditation has a specific purpose, to help you move beyond your like and dislike mind. If you pick and choose the method from suggestions here and there, it means you are placing your own opinion above the method that enlightened beings have passed down and thousands of sincere practitioners have tried and proven. It is an ego trip to meddle like this, as if you are trying to make a magic potion. It only strengthens the hold like and dislike have over you. The person who invents their own practice by piecing it together from parts gleaned here and there builds their own ignorance into whatever structure emerges. It's like building a house with faulty bricks. Every gain has failure built into it.</p>
<p>So you asked me for advice, but you pick and choose which advice to follow. There will be times when you need to use your own wisdom in matters of practice. But why do you suppose you choose to keep your eyes closed? Why write off the issue in such an offhand manner? What are your reasons?</p>
<p>Practice is cause and effect. If you use your mind clearly, you will get clear results. If you use your mind lazily, you will get laxy results. If you treat practice nonchalantly, without care, you will get irregular, faulty results. The way you use your thought and action determines the results you will get in life.</p>
<p>I think you have a sincere mind, and your approach in general is very good. But you need to be careful about how you use your mind. Making assumptions, summing things up in a concept, and arbitrarily discounting certain teachings will limit you.</p>
<p>My suggestion about finding teachers is to try. Try, look, research, ask, try. Learn about the teacher, and try the practice out for some weeks or months. Only one or two times is usually not enough to go on.</p>
<p>Check online. Ask around. If you want to post what city you live in or near, maybe I or someone else can recommend a good teacher. Good teacher is more important than style. Be willing to adapt if you are fortunate enough to start practicing with an awakened master.</p>
