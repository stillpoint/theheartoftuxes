  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><em>First of all, let's note that a live teacher, consistent teaching, practice group, and practice setting are all incredible supports that can help you maintain practice when you'd otherwise quit.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Not every so-called principle applies to every situation. This is a case where you may be overthinking the issue.</p>
<p>If the aim of meditation was only nice feeling, then maybe taking frequent breaks would be a good idea. But is that your purpose? Can we say that the purpose goes beyond just having a nice feeling? </p>
<p>Some possible purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Becoming conscious of your mind's reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waking up from unreality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming more clear and compassionate in everyday life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting and being responsible for your whole self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining freedom from habit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realizing your boundless, eternal nature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attaining the Absolute (the Sacred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining happiness that doesn't disappear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining happiness for all others</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these aims have something in common, which is that they go beyond your habitual like and dislike. There is an unconditional aspect to all of them. In order to <em>get</em> unconditional result you have to -- at least some of the time -- <em>do</em> unconditional practice. That means that meditation can't be based only on your whim or preference.</p>
<p>If you set the precedent of avoiding awareness when something difficult comes up, what shape will your life take? Difficulty will then always make you unaware; and in critical times, when your decisions take on great importance, you will act out of blindness and habit. This is how an out-of-control, suffering life is shaped.</p>
<p>To put it another way, if you want to be aware, you have to practice awareness in all situations, the ones you like and the ones you don't like. If you want to have a stable mind, you have to practice stability whether your feeling is nice or not nice. If you want to be free, you have to practice presence that doesn't fold up and run away when the outer situation changes. If you want to be confident in life, you have to practice showing up even when the situation isn't your favorite.</p>
<p>So this is the first point: the practice itself must not be compromised.</p>
<p>If you're getting burnt out, it indicates an improper relationship with the practice. Either the method is not a good one, or it has not been learned well, or the attitude or application is not correct. Burnout usually means something is being grasped at -- the motivation is not clear and noble, but rather is pushing to get a particular state.</p>
<p>The Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki said it very succinctly: if there is burnout it means that a 'gaining attitude' has taken over.</p>
<p>You use the phrase "higher quality sessions". What does that mean to you -- what makes a session high or low quality? What is important isn't your feeling but your momentary relationship to reality. How do you <em>relate</em> to feeling? Are you openhanded about it, or manipulative? Do you let things be, or is there a gaining attitude?</p>
<p>Life is up and down. Sometimes things are nice, sometimes nasty. Sometimes the going is easy, sometimes difficult. Gain comes with loss; loss comes with gain. This is life. So correct meditation doesn't mean only 'up' and 'easy' and 'gaining'. It means you keep your stable mind, your unmoving awareness, <em>throughout</em> all the ups and downs. Then up and down can't control you.</p>
<p>So you have a lot to look at and consider. Are you clear on the purpose of meditation? Have you learned one good, proven method? Have you learned the method well do you can apply it without doubt and hesitation? Do you follow the method precisely, without compromising based on preference? Do you keep a proper openhanded, non-grasping attitude? </p>
<p>These are all to be considered. It is much, much better to admit the areas that are lacking, and then address them, than to turn a blind eye and continue making the same mistakes.</p>
<p>But there is also the question of skill and appropriateness. If your capacity is not yet developed, it is better to take it easy than to push yourself so hard that you become despondent and give up completely or develop a resentment against your practice.</p>
<p>Since we want the unconditional aspect and we want the consistency of practice that can sink into the consciousness and start to transform it, daily or twice daily practice pretty much without fail is ideal.</p>
<p>But since associating meditation only with stress, discomfort, and futility sabotages the whole process, at first the sessions should be short and pleasant. Learning and enjoying the method should be the focus in the first month or months. You will still be sitting unconditionally for five minutes or so, but it is not so much that you think of give up.</p>
<p>Once you have a strong association between sitting and benefit (peace, ease, self-acceptance, clarity, stability, etc.), then you can start to extend your duration and sit through more difficulty, thus making your mind stronger and more adaptable and free.</p>
<p>But this all depends on having right motivation and right method.</p>
<p>If you feel yourself burning out, you can know that in some aspect (and perhaps more than one aspect) your relationship with the practice is not correct. You can consider: <em>"If this is not absolutely my favorite thing to do in the world, something is wrong."</em></p>
<p>In correct sitting, you get to be completely yourself, and you get to allow the world to be just as it is. This is incredibly liberating. No need to grasp or avoid. No need to try to be something or feel something. No mask to wear, no agenda to fulfill. Everything is okay as-is. It gets at the real heart of life.</p>
<p>So what aspect is 'off'? What void needs to be addressed; or what unnecessary part needs to be cut off?</p>
