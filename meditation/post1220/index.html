  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's good to have a way of recreating your own <em>field</em> — a sort of personal capsule and energy that brings you back to yourself and your deepest intentions.</p>
<p>This is one of the functions of practice clothing, touchstones, and rituals. They all support you in building that field of energy or mind.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing</strong>  <br />
If you will be packing practice clothing like robes, wear it for practice. It could also be something not necessarily traditional like monk's robes, but an item that you always wear at home for sittings. Barring this, make a point of being as clean and fresh as you can for practice — washing at least face and feet, and putting on a fresh shirt. I know this is sometimes easier said than done when traveling.</p>
<p>You could additionally, or as an alternative, use a prayer shawl. A large scarf or shawl can be useful anyway when traveling; and if you keep it fairly clean it can signify your personal sacred space. Cover both shoulders like a cape, or swing one end over the opposite shoulder, or cover only one shoulder and wrap the long end <em>under</em> the opposite arm and across. You can also lay the shawl in front of you to bow on or place sacred objects on.</p>
<p><strong>Touchstones</strong>  <br />
This is a broad category of items that not only symbolize your highest practice, but also <em>invoke</em> that feeling and aspiration for you. A long or short mala, an amulet, a postcard-sized sacred image, or any practice object could by your touchstone. It is important that you keep these items somewhat separate from the rest of your gear, at least in the sense that they should be treated with additional care and respect; because once they become 'just another thing to carry' they begin to lose their power to call you back to practice.</p>
<p>I used to make mini-altars for friends, which were ideal for travel. I'd use a medicine box or large matchbox (the kinds that carry hundreds of wood matches). Eventually I started using smaller pocket-sized matchboxes. I'd draw a piece of calligraphy, like the Chinese word for 'Buddha', and paste it at the bottom of the box. An image of a Buddha or Bodhisattva could also go there. Then other items would fit in the box, like a few sticks of incense, a small holder, a candle, and some matches. It is a lightweight and convenient way to create a practice field: something beautiful to gaze upon, some delightful incense (if you're in a shared room you can just smell the sticks themselves without lighting them), and the glow of a candle — all actively expressing aspects of your own awakening.</p>
<p>For many years I brought a small strung crystal with me wherever I travelled. It would hang in the window to catch the morning or evening sun, making rainbows in the room. I think pretty much everyone who witnessed the rainbows was delighted; no one every objected. This is not so much a practice piece as just a little piece of delight that I'd carry around, and it would never fail to lift my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Ritual</strong>  <br />
When you apply a certain energy repeatedly to a particular object or set of actions, the energy is fed back to you. If you take some moments to ground yourself in the morning and evening — simply, nothing fancy, but the same way every time — it will develop a power that can reach you even in times of turmoil.</p>
<p>Prepare your space the same way; clean up the same way; sit down the same way. Whether you do three bows, or only put your hands together, or whether you just rock back and forth in decreasing amplitude until you reach center — whatever your ritual for beginning practice, just repeating it with the intent to be clear and generous and wake up with the world will help you.</p>
<p>Yoga folks tend to be lucky in that the way they learn their practice usually already has a ritual to it. Taking the postures and regulating the breath becomes their way of returning, grounding. For some, just rolling out the mat triggers a change of mental state.</p>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>  <br />
In terms of the central practice, returning to broad, generous intent is very important. The more it becomes about you and only you, the more discomfort and turmoil will take over. It is the small mind that is easily moved. But when you remember the heart that seeks benefit for all beings, this great wide mind is not easily moved by outer circumstances, and in fact it can rise above all the ups and downs of travel. You may find that this one act — returning to broad compassionate intent — may be more real and more enduring than all the other activities and business you conduct during your travels.</p>
<p>For grounding itself, the physical is very important. Especially bring attention to your contact with the Earth. You may move about on the Earth, but the Earth itself is the constant. You can always find your place: "I am here." For many people, breathing also helps them arrive; but in any case, letting the weight settle, letting tension shed downward, and feeling your physical foundation is a very good grounding practice.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, physical practice is very useful — some whole-body-and-breath activity, to bring your thoughts, your heart, your breath, and your body all together. It also helps digest the energy of the day, especially that erratic, buzzing energy that arises with travel (and with many kinds of work). Moving the whole body together resolves that chaos rather than letting it just sort of cling to you. Sometimes you might even move <em>as</em> the overwhelming energy: shake it out if you're feeling chaotic, collapse and roll around if you're feeling sluggish, make big sharp movements if frustration is building up, and so on. Having expressed your situation sincerely, you can move on; but if you don't somehow acknowledge the energy that's building up, it will just continue to build and may start to control you.</p>
<p>Some people find a similar digestion happens through journaling or artwork.</p>
<p>If you're around a lot of people it can be tricky to find the balance between sincere meditative practice, showing off, and hiding. The key word is 'sincere'. If you keep things simple and don't make a big show, one would think that most people would respect your space. You don't need anything special from outside. Sound is no problem, for instance; talking or music or tv doesn't matter. Just do your thing. Even a minute or so in morning and evening will be a big help, I'm sure. A prayer shawl and/or altar has the added benefit of signaling to others that you are in your own special space (though some may be too unaware to respect it).</p>
<p>If you are interrupted, you can continue to practice "I am here" <em>with</em> the interruption. It becomes "I am here with you". No problem! Someone needs to ask something, or doesn't understand what you're doing, no problem: feel your contact with the Earth where you're standing or sitting (for example, feel your legs and butt on the bed) and internally know "I am here with you" as you address the interruption. Then return to practice until you feel it's time to finish.</p>
<p>You can sit and ground yourself for a couple of minutes at a time. You can also use this as a mindfulness practice through the day, so you don't build up as much tension and anxiety. Feeling your feet standing or walking, remember "I am here... I am here...." You can repeat if you want, but the important thing is the <em>feeling</em>, the sensation of contact with your place just now. Whatever you're doing, you can have your foundation in the background.</p>
<p>"Thank you" is also a very helpful practice. If you prefer, you can do "thank you" instead of "I am here". Again, this can be applied to any situation at any time or place.</p>
<p>It's good to have a very basic, very simple core practice: taking a single conscious breath, or feeling feet on the floor, for instance. Even if things are so chaotic that 'sitting time' goes out the window, you can still have that moment of grounding... and that makes all the difference.</p>
