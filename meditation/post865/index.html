  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>First of all, it seems that there may be some unclarity about the method itself. Are you following the breath, or doing a body scan? Learn one proven method, and learn it well, from a reliable source. Being clear about the method means you are clear about what to do with your mind and body at any particular moment, which frees you from doubt and struggle. (We can note that some <em>vipassana</em> methods first use breath-based meditation to develop concentration and then move to body scanning to develop insight. If that's the training you're following, learn it well and know <em>when</em> to do each phase.)</p>
<p>'More effective' depends on where you're at.</p>
<p>If you are just learning the method it can be useful to be guided through it several times. After a number of repetitions the external voice can be internalized, so you become familiar with how to proceed in the method.</p>
<p>If you are very prone to distraction and can't seem to even <em>begin</em> to find stability on your own, an external voice bringing you back and providing comfort and guidance can be very helpful.</p>
<p>But if you are capable of applying your attention in at least a basic way, and if you have learned the method well, it is very good to 'stand on your own two feet', so to speak, and develop your capacity to continue on your own. This makes you more independent in practice and in life. You exercise the qualities that are of use in meditation: the ability to let go of thought and distraction, the ability to return to the task (to reality), the development of faith in the process and faith in yourself.</p>
<p>Many people in this day and age are very distanced from their bodies. We live up in our heads, in the unreal world of thought and imagination. Most often, this has become hardened into a pattern of avoiding the messages of the body, avoiding feelings and sensations, and trying to control life with either thought or distraction/avoidance.</p>
<p>If this is the case for you, there may be other pathways besides meditation that will be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical practice involving movement along with listening to the body is extremely effective. I've written a lot on physical practice in previous posts; you can search my posting history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expressive pursuits like dance or dance therapy or art therapy can be wonderfully connecting and liberating. Dance is an exceptionally wonderful companion to meditation: it helps to ground and digest meditative experience; it can embrace and express all content of the heart and mind; it prompts a healthy flow of blood, breath, and energy; it awakens the wisdom of the body; and it makes you ready to sit with great calmness and stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifestyle changes like body care can be an ongoing strategy: taking luxurious baths; wearing clothing that is comfortable and easy to move in (clothing that doesn't disconnect you from the body, including footwear that allows you to feel the earth); getting frequent massages or doing regular self-massage; taking time to check in with the body repeatedly throughout the day, perhaps at waking, mealtimes, and going to sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body-based therapy or body-based mindfulness training guided by a live therapist or teacher can be useful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Know that meditation doesn't have to be easy. Don't let that misconception derail the process for you. You can help it <em>be</em> easier by not making a big deal of things in your thinking. Don't make a story about your situation or condition; reject thoughts about how many times you have to bring yourself back to awareness.</p>
<p>Instead, let your practice be very momentary. <strong>It's only about now.</strong> Just this moment, let go of distraction and return to feeling the body. That is how you gain the ability: through practice. If you don't practice, you won't magically gain the ability. It's just that you shouldn't make a big drama about returning. When you go away, once you notice it just return simply and quickly. Each time, one time, just now.</p>
<p>As you continue to return, return, return, your ability to return will grow, and you will also become more grounded in the body and will go away less frequently. It is the <em>returning</em> that is trained in meditation. You are not expected to have some perfectly ideal state of being in meditation; you are expected to keep applying the ability to let go of distraction and return.</p>
<p>So meditation doesn't have to be hard or easy; but your <em>attitude</em> can be easy — you can just return in the present moment, without making extra stress or struggle. It's as if you pick up a piece of paper that's fallen out of your pocket. You don't need to get frustrated or make an idea about how much of a problem it is that the paper fell out. Just, once you notice it's fallen, you pick it up. Very simple, very efficient. Only take care of the moment.</p>
