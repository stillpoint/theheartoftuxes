  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There are many different forms of meditation, with many different effects and purposes. What is <em>your</em> purpose, and how does it support the purpose of your life?</p>
<p>Do you want to develop concentration? Do you want to practice letting go of thoughts that control you? Do you want stress reduction, or better health, or psychological insight, or insight into the nature of reality? There is of course some overlap, but there is a different set of practices focused on each of these aims.</p>
<p>So how you use your mind and breath will depend on the particular method you are learning; and the particular method you are learning should be based on what you hope to achieve.</p>
<p>You don't have to ascribe to Buddhist teaching; but just for example, in Buddhism the highest aim for meditation is to wake up from the dream of life and help all beings wake up and become completely happy and fulfilled. Is this what you are aiming at, or something else? Your answer will be based on this question.</p>
<p>Flowers unfold from their center. Likewise, the pattern of any life situation, and the pattern of practice, unfold from your center. The flower of your life comes from the very center of you, your core or essence. When the center is clear, the whole unfolding is clear. When the center is not clear, the unfolding is not clear. So clarity about your core is necessary: who are you; what is your main purpose in staying alive?</p>
<p>You may receive many different responses to your question, and it's possible that all of them may be good responses; and at the same time it's possible that all of them may say different things. Different paths, different aims, different methods.</p>
<p>Breath-based meditation is not even the only way; there are countless other forms that don't key on breath. So why choose one over another?</p>
<p>You have obviously heard or read about following the breath. Is this from one source or several? It's okay to try out different methods, but you should give them time and experience each one in its own integrity. Don't mix. Mixing leads to confusion.</p>
<p>As you try out a method, you should also be clarifying your reason for meditating, your aspiration and how it relates to your life purpose. If it doesn't serve your life purpose, why do it, why waste the time and effort? Gradually as you keep revisiting the question your direction in life will become more clear, and thus your reason for meditating and the kind of meditation to choose will become more clear.</p>
<p>Pure meditation means that the mind doesn't move in response to what appears. External objects, sensations, images, thoughts, feelings — anything can appear, linger, disappear, or be absent, and it is no problem; the mind doesn't move. This is pure meditation. Pure meditation is pure perception: you see clearly, hear clearly, smell clearly, taste clearly, feel clearly, and perceive your thought clearly without being caught up in any of it.</p>
<p>But in our contemporary society most people don't have the baseline of calmness and clarity to do that kind of meditation right off the bat. Our minds tend to be too agitated, and we tend to attach to things too strongly. So even if someone attempts pure meditation sincerely it may happen that they are frequently distracted. And there is a point after which the distraction becomes too much; it no longer becomes worthwhile to make the effort, because little to no actual meditation is being done. </p>
<p>Therefore, concentration training often comes before pure meditation or other formless practices. (In some cases, other methods of settling the mind may be used, such as vigorous physical activity, even if it doesn't involve a concentration practice. This is common in internal/energetic martial arts, for example, where physical training tends to come first.) In concentration practice a very clear form of method is offered, with a very clear object of focus. The structure makes it very clear to the practitioner when they have gone off in distraction, and it provides something very clear to return to. Thus the returning is facilitated, and the mind settles, and the practitioner is more ready for pure meditation.</p>
<p>So what is your aim; and where are you on that spectrum of distraction/concentration? Usually a teacher will know best where you are at. The habitual, distracted mind is not well able to judge its own state. We tend to place our own preference on a pedestal and think of it as the goal, so left to our own devices we easily lose our way. It is very valuable to have access to a consistent, wise, unconditional perspective — which comes from the guidance of a teacher. With consistent teaching your <em>study</em> and your <em>experience</em> can join and become wisdom. Only hearing various things and then having erratic experiences is difficult to make sense of; and even if you do make sense of it, it is often your own made-up sense rather than the intended path.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clarify your direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find one proven, traditional method that supports your direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn it from one reliable (authorized, and ideally awakened) source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn it very well, so you can practice without doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply it meticulously, without adding extraneous parts or leaving out parts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then cause produces result. Because the aim, method, and application are all correct, the result will certainly come.</p>
<p>So what do you want from meditation? Do you want focus while excluding parts of experience; or do you want to train in allowing the moment to unfold; or...? Also, is this meant for specific sitting periods, or for use throughout the day?</p>
