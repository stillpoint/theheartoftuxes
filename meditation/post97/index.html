  <h1>Meditation revealed that I'm jealous and bitter about my rich best friend. How to overcome?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>...my extremely rich best friend doesn't have to worry about his future, does not feel any pressure and basically enjoys life....</em></p>
<p>Wow, that is just so inaccurate. That all comes from your own thinking, and does not at all reflect the situation.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own form of suffering. Americans have American-style suffering; Iraqis have Iraqi-style suffering; Tibetans have Tibetan-style suffering.</p>
<p>Poor people have poor-person suffering; rich people have rich-person suffering. A lot of rich people — like you — think of themselves as poor. If you have the leisure to be posting on Reddit rather than working in a sweatshop or scraping food out of a garbage can, you are living like a king, far better than much of the world's population. If you have the use of all your limbs, eyes that can see, ears that can hear, intelligence to understand speech, the ability to communicate, and the ability to love, then you are spectacularly, miraculously rich. It is the height of foolishness to think nothing of all the benefit you have in your life.</p>
<p>Uneducated people have suffering from lack of education. Educated people have suffering from their education. When it's hot, you have hot suffering; when it's cold, you have cold suffering; and when it's moderate, you have moderate-weather suffering.</p>
<p><strong>The origin of the suffering is not <em>out there</em>.</strong> The origin is in your own mind. You don't understand who you really are, you don't understand the true purpose of your life, so you have suffering. This all comes from your mind, your thinking.</p>
<p>If you were to go to a different place, walking ten steps south of where you are now, your inner situation would remain. If you were to eat a bagel, you would still have the blind spots, self-doubt, neuroses, fears, frustrations, and flaws that you had before you ate the bagel. Likewise, if you had $20 or $20M more, your inner situation would remain.</p>
<p>Power in itself is not good and not bad. More power just magnifies whatever you have. So if you have control of your mind, you can benefit many people through power. But if you don't have control of your mind, more power will easily bring you and many others to ruin.</p>
<p>This can be said of money, fame, influence, sex, and internal energy. In any field, more power just intensifies what you have. Sex with love intensifies love; sex with attachment intensifies attachment; sex with anger intensifies anger; and sex with confusion intensifies confusion. It's the same with money. Just see how the lives of rich and famous people can easily collapse into ruin: the faults and difficulties that many of us can hide or move past get magnified and become weighty burdens for them. "When you have little, you have little to lose."</p>
<p>Money hasn't the slightest thing whatsoever to do with clarity, insight, compassion, contentment, equanimity, balance, nobility of character, or any other true basis of happiness.</p>
<p>So the only way there is a difference between you and your friend is if you make a difference in your mind. Why don't you have some kindness for your friend instead of pushing him away into another category? How is it for him that you are now far away in your thoughts and emotions simply because of money? Show some loving kindness.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As a practice, you can try any of the <em>Brahmavihara</em> practices (translated as Divine Abidings/Sublime Attitudes/The Four Immeasurables), but especially <em>Mudita</em>/Shared Joy — rejoicing in the benefit of others.</p>
<p>The basic structure of the meditation is that you start by generating and connecting with joy itself. You can imagine frolicking puppies, or a young horse frisking and leaping in the field, or an inspiring time with someone, or whatever image or memory brings you in contact with the energy of joy.</p>
<p>Then you offer to share that joy with some being that's easy to share with. Like maybe those playful puppies: you give your joy back to them, and revel in the fact that it is shared — a spontaneous, unguarded, friendly joy from being to being.</p>
<p>Next you begin to radiate that joy to others, starting with those who are very easy to share with, moving on to those who are sort of neutral, and finally offering that joyful energy to those you have a problem with or those difficult people who need it the most. In your case, you can spend time sharing joy in your heart with your friend. Note the benefits in his life, and feel happy for him as if you were enjoying those benefits yourself. So, far from separating yourself and building walls with your mind, you take down the walls and do <em>identity action</em>; you let your heart become one with your friend, and wish him all the benefit in the world — whatever benefit you would wish for yourself, and more. And you <em>rejoice</em> in it, experiencing the good feeling yourself!</p>
<p>This is the practice of enlightened mind. The Brahmaviharas are aspects of enlightened mind, which is what you really are. When you practice them, you come closer to your inherent enlightenment.</p>
<p>Another way of radiating joy is to generate the feeling and then offer it to all the directions systematically, or to envision and feel it spreading outward in all directions infinitely. So your shared joy should in either practice become boundless and infinite — by the time you finish your practice session, your joy should include every being and everything.</p>
<p>The practice of shared joy is not only for meditation time. You must practice it repeatedly, whenever you see someone else gain benefit. You must make your own heart wide and generous and joyful. That is the basis for your own happiness and the happiness of others.</p>
