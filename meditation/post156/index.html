  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Dullness or being 'turned off' is a kind of thinking. That's not what we're going for.</p>
<p>There's a 'no thinking' that is dull and unaware, like a fog-covered landscape, which just means something is broken or covering the bright nature of your mind; and there's a 'no thinking' that is very clear, like a still lake that perfectly reflects the landscape in every detail.</p>
<p>You can't necessarily tell on your own. You learn a proper method, and you learn how to apply it properly, and you learn and apply the correct attitude... but then you just <em>do</em> it. You are not the one who can check on how it's going, at least not until you have done a lot of practice and have very reliable access to that clear, bright nature of mind. That is one of the things that a teacher does: perceives your mind and checks your progress.</p>
<p>That is good that you are taking care not to fall into the same old patterns. Many people carry over their addictions and habits, applying them to meditation without being aware of it. Many people use meditation to disappear or escape or avoid.</p>
<p>So it is important to very strongly base meditation on an intent to invite the truth, moment to moment, however it may unfold. We sit with sincerity, with openhandedness. So we relax the body, which carries so many patterns. We relax the shoulders which otherwise may reinforce fearful patterns. We relax the jaws, which otherwise may reinforce controlling patterns. We relax the hands and the belly, which otherwise may grasp and resist. We relax and balance the spine, which may otherwise tense into prideful patterns or slump into defeatist patterns. Every body part can perpetuate stories and patterns; so we work on bringing forth balance and ease.</p>
<p>Likewise, we relax the mental attitude. We don't try to get or force or hold any particular state. We don't try to be anything in particular. This is a huge departure from the way we usually use our minds! Usually we try to arrange things, inside and outside. We usually try to be good and feel good and get a good situation; but meditation is very radically non-attached to that. In meditation, we say "so be it": whatever is real, let it be; whatever is not real, let me not hold it or react to it.</p>
<p>So our approach, our mind-and-body posture, is very sincere. Only not-knowing. We don't wield any judgment or agenda or measuring stick; we just sit in the center.</p>
<p>Meditation, then, is a practice of being at the center. Everything comes from that point of sincerity, of non-grasping, non-doing, non-knowing. We don't try to apply predetermined forms from the outside. We don't try to look like anything in particular or feel like anything in particular. It is like the perfectly still, silent point when you are balancing a stick on your hand and it finds its balance. It is like the open, empty point at the end of a breath, before anything happens.</p>
<p>If you make the center right, everything will follow. So it's about returning to the pure, non-grasping center; it's not about checking. It's not about jumping <em>out</em> of the center, out of your meditation, and looking at yourself and trying to figure out how you're doing and what you should tweak.</p>
<p>All of this means that you need to be very clear on your meditation method. And in order to be clear on it and have reasonable faith in it, you need to learn it well, and it ought to be a proven traditional method. If you try to invent your own method or use something that an amateur has thrown together, there's no good reason to have faith in it; there's only blind belief and hopefulness. Then when you get to the point where you are not sure what's going on, you will inevitably want to check to see how things are going, rather than continuing to return to the method, continuing to return to the center.</p>
<p>I'll also mention, as has often been mentioned in this forum, that keeping your eyes closed <em>increases</em> dullness and <em>invites</em> drifting and dozing. There are very particular methods that use closed eyes appropriately, but unless your method correctly calls for it you should keep your eyes open. This is another of the many points that may seem inconsequential to those who aren't aware of its influence, but actually can make a huge difference (sometimes <em>all</em> the difference) between meditating effectively or wasting your time. There are many points that are to be learned in their proper order and experienced through your own application.</p>
<p>There is nothing to expect. Sometimes nothing will seem to happen, and sometimes strange things will happen. All of it comes under the category of 'things that happen'. Your job is not to mess about with the things that happen, but to stay at the center, with ongoing sincerity. Pure-minded, open-handed, not knowing and not expecting; just ready. Moment to moment to moment, like this.</p>
<p>But learn a proper method, from a proper source, and learn it properly.</p>
