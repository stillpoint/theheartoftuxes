  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Maybe I'll give good advice; maybe I won't. How will you know?</p>
<p>If your purpose is to be more present and less distracted, then the general practice is to remain undistracted. It is very plain and simple, nothing special, and with no special technique necessary. There is nothing in particular to feel, and certainly you don't need to seek or hold a feeling of stillness.</p>
<p>When you are aware and present, it means you are undistracted. Objects of the senses or objects of thought don't take you away. But what you are present with changes. Sometimes it is still, sometimes it is active. Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't. The content of the moment has nothing to do with the practice of non-distraction. Your practice is to keep returning to awareness.</p>
<p>People hear this and think "Well, what is awareness? How will I know when I have it?" It is not that special or arcane. It is not a special state or feeling. It just means not grasping at sights, sounds, other sense experiences, or thoughts; so these objects don't take you away.</p>
<p>Since we have a very distracted, grasping habit, we <em>will</em> cling to objects; and objects <em>will</em> take us away. That is the natural process of our habit. When something distracts you, once you notice it just return. Very simple practice. An experience of stillness is not necessary; don't add <em>that</em> grasping habit!</p>
<p>In trying to maintain consistent awareness, many people find their mind's grasping habit overwhelming. It attaches very easily to objects, and before knowing it the person is taken away, time and again. So there are methods that use the habit of holding objects to advantage: one object is kept as an anchor. Rather than floating freely with no attachment (and thus, for some, at the mercy of all kinds of distractions), one keeps an object of focus in the background. It is held easily and casually, lest the practitioner become weary or resentful of the practice.</p>
<p>In your case, maybe breath was the anchor for your mindfulness. It is a very good object for an anchor, among other possible objects. Whether an object is good or bad depends on the character of the person; but breath tends to be useful for almost everyone: it is very close to you, it carries a lot of useful information with it about states of mind and emotion, you can sense it very sensitively, and it is always with you.</p>
<p>It brings up an interesting point in practice. Often we look out for immediate distractions, like events that pop up next to us, or thoughts that come out of left field. What we may not be so aware of is the slower, more systemic onset of distraction, as we start to get bored or antsy or doubtful. "Is this really helping me? Isn't there something better? Surely there's a way that will 'click' better with me." And so on.... This too is distraction. It is to be approached in the same way as any distracting train of thought: immediately and effortlessly let it go, and return openly to the moment.</p>
<p>In your case, why abandon the breath? What is the <em>real</em> reason? Something you know... something you wonder... something you speculate.... Or that sense of doubting your practice, and whether it's good enough... or maybe that it should be easier? This is the insidious function of the grasping mind.</p>
<p>You are not yet very clear on the motivation for practice. You know you want mindfulness, but you don't know what mindfulness is for. It is like someone who says he wants money. Why? What is the correct <em>use</em> for the money? People don't want money just to have paper lying around, or some numbers on a computer screen. That doesn't make them eager. They want money because they dream of what they can do with it; but these dreams can be very vague and almost unconscious. It is the same with a beginner who doesn't understand their clear direction. Why meditate or practice mindfulness? Why do anything in life? What is the right direction, the right purpose of life and the efforts you make in it? This has to be clarified so you understand the correct purpose of mindfulness. Then you can understand the correct method and attitude and necessary supports. All of these understandings come from knowing your true direction in life.</p>
<p>Again, if you were studying a proven method with a teacher, within a tradition, you would have many extremely beneficial supports. Not the least of which would be the teacher him/herself, giving you a living example of the results of practice. Furthermore, you would have a tradition of years and centuries of successes, of benefit, of fruition. The teaching would be proven in rationality as well as in your experience. So there are many, many ways <em>studying with a teacher can relieve you of doubt</em> about practice.</p>
<p>That's not to say you won't have doubt; but you have a chance to address it. On your own, your doubt can become the leader. Your doubt can say "Maybe I should change this practice; let's do this other thing that looks superior." Your doubt — meaning the ignorance of your ego — can very easily take control of the whole process and keep your from progressing. People get caught up in guessing for years and lifetimes. It is not a minor issue.</p>
