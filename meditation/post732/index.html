  <h1>Struggling with meditating</h1>

<p>This is exceedingly common. It's par for the course. I would venture that every meditator could at least relate to your difficulties.</p>
<p>1) You ask why you procrastinate so much. The bottom line is you don't yet fully realize the cause-and-effect of meditation. That is, you don't see clearly the cause of suffering in your life and how meditation can address that cause. So you need more experience, that's all. Like most of us.</p>
<p>The ego — the self-image or self-idea we hold — wants to maintain control of thoughts and feelings. The ego is all about maintaining the status quo. That's because the "self" wants to keep that idea going, wants to keep itself alive. If things threaten to change your self-image or your notion of where you fit in the world, the ego resists as if it's fighting for its own life.</p>
<p>But you are <em>not</em> just a small, encapsulated, unchanging being. You are not just the self-idea, but much more. The whole universe is within your mind. When you realize that you are already boundless and complete, you cease to suffer; you no longer fear loss or assume you are missing something essential.</p>
<p>Meditation, then, is the practice of your original completion. You stop regenerating the tight little suffering self, and let your <em>big self</em> emerge.</p>
<p>The procrastination likely comes from a fear of losing control, losing the sense of self. But the movement toward meditative practice comes from your deeper need to be true, and complete, and at peace.</p>
<p>Sometimes procrastination will win. This is your karma, the pattern you have already built by your past behaviors. Don't worry about it; only try. If you keep trying, then little by little your karma will change.</p>
<p>It is important not to think poorly of yourself when you don't live up to your expectations. Just keep returning. If you add guilty and frustrated thoughts you create more karmic patterns that keep you from experiencing your complete and peaceful nature. But if you keep coming back to practice again and again, eventually your true nature will win out over those patterns.</p>
<p>Only keep trying. Even if you take a wrong road for three years, as soon as you realize it just immediately return and try. Don't cry over spilt milk.</p>
<p>2) The reason it takes so much effort during sitting is the same. The sitting is just a microcosm of what's going on in your life off the meditation mat: the ego is struggling for control, so you fight with your own mind. That's tiring!</p>
<p>Meditation must not be conceived of as a battle. You should not be trying to wrestle your mind into submission, or even make anything in particular happen. Only find a good method and follow it. Just follow the method, nothing else.</p>
<p>One of the ways the self-image tries to maintain control is by keeping you busy being something — being a "do-er" or an "experiencer". The mind habitually goes out to objects so it can feel itself (think of itself) as a subject. You eventually think of it as uncomfortable to simply rest without being busy or thinking about something. But just the opposite is the case: the habit of grasping at objects is agitation, suffering; allowing the mind to ungrasp is profound peace.</p>
<p>When you sit and apply yourself to the method of meditation, you begin to notice your mind's situation. You become aware of your karma — the particular way your mind moves. Although it can be a rude awakening, it is an important awakening. "Holy crap! My mind is not at all stable or disciplined!" That's an appropriate insight for a beginning meditator. And, my friend, that is why we practice: so we can move beyond the patterns that enslave us.</p>
<p>The ego thinks that discipline is imprisonment and distraction is freedom. The wisdom mind sees that discipline is a movement toward freedom. It is freedom from the like-and-dislike habits that control us.</p>
<p>At the beginning, you will not be an expert. If you continue, you will improve. That's just the way it is with practice. So don't worry about results; don't try to check how well you're doing. Don't check when you're doing meditation, and don't check after you've done meditation. Only try.</p>
<p>Keeping it up for 5 minutes is wonderful! That is 5 minutes more clarity than millions of people are willing or able to try. The fact that you have already tried meditation, and are following up with questions here in order to improve shows that you have very, very fortunate practice karma. It is very rare and fortunate to be on this path. Be thankful, and only try.</p>
<p>Some points that will likely be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>find a good method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during meditation, only follow the method; don't concern yourself with anything else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek out a teacher you can trust and learn from; even if it takes you many months or years, it will be one of the best things ever in your life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practice with others and commit to mutual support of each other's awakening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep your living space clean and orderly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you can, devote a space to reminding yourself of your original clear mind — symbols of light and clarity like a candle, clear water, and a fresh flower can call to your way-seeking mind even when distracting thoughts appear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spending time in natural surroundings can remind you of your original clear and natural mind, and can inspire you to return to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical practice is <em>very</em> helpful in settling the mind; vigorous, rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath exercise is best (bowing is the traditional companion to sitting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diet and relationships influence the mind tremendously; balanced diet and correct, warm-hearted relationship to others help the mind to settle even before meditation is attempted</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to talk about method or about physical practice or other aspects of training, feel free to message me. Good luck!</p>
