  <h1>After one year of meditation, I think I'm starting to lose the grip.</h1>

<p>Hi OP! This reply is in two parts because I reached the word limit.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I've heard that in very deep meditations, you become so detached that you're no longer connected to this realm. Would you discourage that?</em></p>
<p>That's a good question, but maybe it's a question for yourself instead of a question for anyone else. Different meditation practices often have different aims, effects, and results. The guiding question is <em>why</em> do one rather than any other, and in fact why do meditation at all? That is, how does meditation relate to your purpose or direction in life?</p>
<p>You've stated that dreaminess and drowsy states are the opposite of what you're trying to achieve, and that you want to feel present and connected with what you're doing and whom you're with. That's great! This moves in the direction of <em>waking up</em> to reality rather than escaping and trying to find some particular state in which to cocoon. If that's your direction, then I would say you're very fortunate; you avoid the many mistakes and suffering situations that come from grasping (at a particular state).</p>
<p>A great master said "<strong>To hit the mark completely means there is no new nest in which to settle.</strong>" One aspect of awakening is that it never stops anywhere. Trying to stop the flow and find something definite to hold on to or a certain place within which to settle is our suffering habit. To have a direction that openhandedly embraces things-as-they-are is wonderful and fortunate.</p>
<p>I don't have experience with Soundmind recordings, but from what you've said, and with a cursory glance at the website, it seems like a good program of meditation. <em>Vipassana</em> is a well-established and proven method of meditation. It embraces that same direction of openly looking into reality <em>as it is</em> rather than grasping at or forcing certain states. <em>Vipassana</em> requires no external authority or religious dogma (although it can work within religious frameworks as well), and the attainments associated with the practice come directly from your own effort rather than through an intermediary — you can do it yourself.</p>
<p>So by all accounts, you have two very important benefits going for you: a good direction and a good method. Along with these, I would recommend at some point finding a good teacher and a good practice community.</p>
<p>Associating with a teacher gives you access to immediate, situational teaching that is not available any other way. There is no substitute for the immediate reflection of a clear mind; and there is no substitute for the living example of what correct practice can achieve. One action, one correction, one <em>look</em> from the eyes of an awakened one can be life-changing.</p>
<p>The benefit of practicing within a community must also not be underestimated. Awakening is not only about meditation, but also about cultivating wisdom and correct relationship (together these are the three aspects or "gates" of Dharma: <em>Dhyana</em> — sometimes called <em>Samadhi</em>, which is meditation; <em>Prajna</em>, which is wisdom; and <em>Sila</em>, which is ethical behaviour and correct relationship). It is very difficult to train in correct relationship on your own. Practicing with others, you come up against your hard edges, the places where you are stiff, where you cling to your own way; so then you learn to let go and act with others, and your hard edges become smooth. Your character becomes clear.</p>
<p>These points are very important for both newcomers and for people who have done a lot of study: First, awakening is not merely based on meditation and/or cognition. Second, meditation itself is built on the foundation of Sila, or correct relationship. Without developing the character and behavior in daily life, the mind cannot be calm and clear enough to attain subtle and profound attainments. This is a definite, inescapable cause-and-effect connection. So practicing with others is a big help toward your aim.</p>
<p>Next, you wonder about going further into subtle states and becoming detached from "this realm", from "the real world". This raises the questions: What <em>is</em> "this" realm? What <em>is</em> the "real" world?</p>
<p>Is there a realm you can detach from? Is there one situation that is real and one that is not? We need to understand that even our speech and thinking about reality and unreality is empty: it creates distinctions that, while useful, are ultimately false.</p>
<p>Said another way; from the unenlightened perspective, there is definitely reality and unreality: we get stuck in a world made from our concepts and assumptions, and fail to apprehend the true nature of things. But from the enlightened perspective, everything is truth. Even wrong thinking has the same essential substance; even wrong view is made of awakened mind.</p>
<p>The upshot is that if your aim is sincere and open-handed, as you progress you will let go of false forms and attain new experiences of that one awakened mind that has no form. (The Mahayanists call this "attaining emptiness".) What you let go of may be <em>common</em> or <em>usual</em>; it may be what you think of as "this" reality; but in fact you are letting go of illusory ideas and forms. This letting go of previous illusions is what provides the space for clear insight (<em>Vipassana</em>) to appear.</p>
<p>Every meditator will experience strange new things. This is because they are forging ahead into new territory. We should not confuse "what I have always known" with "what is true". We move ahead with a scientist's curiosity and an artist's self-trust.</p>
<p>The letting-go faculty is one of the major skills to be developed in practice. This is concentration: letting go of distraction, letting go of falsehood and assumption, letting everything be what it is without your interference. When the letting-go faculty is developed, one may experience a radically different kind of concentration, where profound stillness appears by itself. No effort is made to bring the mind back; the mind's own light shines effortlessly. This is called <em>samadhi</em>. There are different kinds of <em>samadhi</em>, but it may manifest as a deep silence and stillness in which the senses and thought faculty are not stirred. "I" and "the world" disappear, and there is no self-reflecting sense of that disappearing, no thought or awareness "Oh, everything has disappeared."</p>
<p>That kind of <em>samadhi</em> itself is very healing and nurturing to the bodymind, but there is no self-aware experience until you come out of it. It is on the edges of <em>samadhi</em>, as you're entering it or more often as you're exiting it, that deep insight and even earth-shaking awakening can appear. At the least, you can get a glimpse of your true mind, your true nature; and this one glimpse changes your life forever. Even if it later gets covered up, seeing into your own true nature has a way of organizing and prioritizing everything in your life. One can begin to see the inevitability of eventual full awakening.</p>
<p><em>Samadhi</em> is not good or bad. But attachment to it can be a problem. So the curse is not the event itself, but one's improper relationship to it. For those without a clear direction, the <em>samadhi</em> itself can seem like the main point. The meditator then seeks it out and wishes to stay there, denying everyday life and giving up on correct relationship. The pivotal point here is not the <em>samadhi</em> but the clarity of direction: maintaining the inner vow to remain openhanded and ungrasping, and to keep moving toward awakening rather than getting stuck in any state or relying on any experience.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to have a clear direction <em>before</em> setting out to gain concentrative power, get deep experiences, gather special energy, and so on. These things can be too intoxicating for those who are unclear, and so these practitioners trade previous attachments to mundane things for attachments to spiritual things. But they are still attachments, still entanglements, and they still keep the practitioner in an endless cycle of grasping and becoming, if they are not let go of. Here again, practice with a good teacher and with a community can help you maintain your correct direction when the lure of samadhi-bliss catches you.</p>
<p>We can talk of one's practice career in terms of what to seek and what to avoid, but it rarely unfolds so cleanly. We <em>will</em> develop attachments despite our efforts, we <em>will</em> have blind spots, we <em>will</em> make mistakes. Many people in practice communities, even despite good teaching, will attach to <em>samadhi</em> or some other aspect of practice (like, for instance, being a know-it-all). There will be some period of losing the way, and some resultant suffering. It may continue for weeks, or perhaps for a significant portion of one's life, or even perhaps over many lifetimes. That is okay, and it can be seen as part of the process of clarification, of "working it out". If you just keep moving, you will find your <em>own</em> way. It may not be conventional or comfortable, but it will be your path, your unfolding. If you keep moving, then eventually your errors and suffering become your wisdom; and then you will have the ability to heal and guide others who are making the same mistakes that you once made or encountering the difficulties you once encountered.</p>
