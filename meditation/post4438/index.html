  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>We seem to think very differently about a lot of things.</em></p>
<p>No problem. That's to be expected.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>You wrote "The movement of energy in the energetic body changes." If you could elaborate on what is your understanding of 'energetic body' I could elaborate more easily on what bothers me about it.</em></p>
<p>You are bothered without being able to define what you're bothered about; and yet you still want to blame my words for your bother rather than owning the fact that <em>you</em> are triggered -- that the origin of your upset is within you. That disowning and that unconsciousness are what create the shadow.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Also, how are these things an 'iteration of energy'? I find that particularly hard to see in the notions of space and consciousness.</em></p>
<p>If you don't understand that point, why blame the point rather than your understanding?</p>
<p>These are all iterations of energy. It's another way of taking about the substance of things, the substance of the world and the things in it. Whether you name it 'energy', 'consciousness', 'Buddha Mind', 'God', or 'the nameless', the important thing is to attain what the word is pointing to. If you attach to words or hold prejudiced opinions, of course it will be unclear to you.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I've read through my points of critique again and I find it quite plain, if at times implicit. I don't know why you don't see it.</em></p>
<p>I get that you take issue with my post. But you don't get why you take issue with it.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>"Then you can progress from level to level." - what levels...</em></p>
<p>We can talk of many different levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced, for instance; or levels of concentrative absorption; and so on. There is a tremendous amount of teaching on the various levels one may pass through. Just to know that there are distinct stages, with particular qualities and particular signs of attainment, is useful. It starts to set out the possible paths one may choose and prepares one for the changes that may appear.</p>
<p>But you can't have it both ways, grumbling that I'm saying both too much and too little. You are triggered by talk of levels because of something in you, not because of something inherently in the words.</p>
<p>&gt;*...why presume levels at all...</p>
<p>The levels are conventions of teaching, passed down by many masters. Originally they don't exist, as no concept originally exists; it is all just useful for the meditator, like mathematics is useful for us in daily life. One moves from state to state, concentration deepens and various experiences and abilities appear. The very point of OP's question presumes that there is somewhere to go, somewhere too advanced to. The very point of your rejoinders presumes that you wish to achieve something, that there is a different state you wish to get to.</p>
<p>I could just as well ask you why you presume there's 'me' and 'you', and why you go on and on about them. It doesn't originally exist. It's not real. But we use the words to point to something.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...how does that help - or is even remotely related - to the OP?</em></p>
<p>It is very much related to OP. If you don't see it, it's not my duty to justify my writing to you; it's up to you to consider it. No one can force you to be open to something new. Can you put down your reactivity long enough to consider openly?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>My own view: I would not have mentioned levels because the OP didn't ask about anything related to meditative progression at all.</em></p>
<p>That's your own view. That's fine. It means you don't see what I see. But the part you add is the emotional reactivity. Because you don't see it you then feel the need to attack. That is the shadow emerging.</p>
<p>But you say "I would not have..." as if you were writing the post. What do <em>you</em> have to offer OP and other readers? If you feel you can do better, don't just crow about it: let us hear <em>your</em> words on the topic.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>My trigger: Mentioning levels in the way you did ('coyote learning style'), to me, made you come across self-important and pretentious.</em></p>
<p>Once again you ask for explanation and then criticize me for giving an explanation. This is not owning your trigger. You are still shifting blame to the words rather than admitting what it is within you that is so reactive. Are self-importance and pretentiousness aspects of your own character that are particularly troubling, and that you try to distance yourself from?</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Words like 'close guidance', 'master', 'mess around', 'must', 'step by step', 'very qualified' all induce fear and doubt in practitioners....</em></p>
<p>No, they don't. I've spoken to thousands of meditators who haven't been fearful when those words were used. Again, you foist <em>your</em> inner experience on the outer form.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this to place blame on you, but in the hope that it will be of use in your life. I have a shadow too, we all do if we're not fully enlightened; and I can certainly relate personally to the question I'm going to ask:</p>
<p>Did someone shut you down at some point, giving you fear rather than encouragement? It's quite common that parents, for instance, may smother a child and unwittingly induce fear in the attempt to keep them safe. This error comes from the <em>parents'</em> shadows -- <em>their</em> inability to own their inner experience (in this case, fear), and their subsequent burdening of the child with material that doesn't belong to him/her.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if that's the case; but you need to distinguish the reactions that arise within you from the outside world. That stuff that triggers you comes from your own mind.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...they indicate that it's easy to do something wrong. But that simply isn't true.</em></p>
<p>Really? So we're good to go, then, and my guidance can hardly do any harm.</p>
<p>You can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Sure there are wrong ways to meditate, but there is room to grow and learn from experience...</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>...instead of blindly (and that is basically what you seem to be suggesting) following some sort of super-guru.</em></p>
<p>Stop putting words in my mouth. If that's what you got from my post, you got it completely wrong. I never talked about a guru. I certainly never talked about a super-guru. I never suggested blindness. In fact, my recommendations are aimed at <em>overcoming</em> blindness.</p>
<p>You've imagined a scenario where a student is totally shut down and robotically controlled by a manipulative authority. That is something <em>you</em> made up. It comes from <em>your</em> shadow, <em>your</em> reactivity. It has nothing to do with my suggestions.</p>
<p>A good teacher helps a student avoid pitfalls, or helps them encounter pitfalls and get through them. The teacher provides helpful -- and at certain levels of practice, <em>necessary</em> -- support. It is a liberating, empowering relationship. The student is led back to themselves, back to their true aim, again and again, faithfully. It's for the sake of growth and freedom. I'm encouraging a fertile practice situation. So if anyone is fear-mongering, it is you.</p>
<p>And this is usually the case when shadow takes control: the stuff that is closest to you is what gets dumped on the most. I suspect you were so triggered because aspects of my post reminded you too much of yourself. But that's just a speculation; you can look into it yourself if you're inclined.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>My own view: If I felt that there was some real danger, I would have... I might have....</em></p>
<p>So go ahead. Let's take it out of the imaginary realm and make it real. Offer something of your own.</p>
<p>You make some good points, and you have some knowledge, so please go ahead and share it.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I felt prompted to protect vulnerable readers and offer some encouragement to experiment.</em></p>
<p>Thank you for speaking up for vulnerable readers. I don't begrudge your expression, and I cheer on your protective care. I just think that there's also a good measure of knee-jerk defense of your own shadow material there for you as well.</p>
<p><em>It would seem that you would expect everyone to reply and ask for 'coyote style teaching', but not everyone does.</em></p>
<p>Not at all. I know very well that many won't take to it. And that's fine; and your own style is also fine. I'm not writing to the lowest common denominator; my writing changes according to the situation.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I hope that clears it up.</em></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time and effort. Good luck in your life.</p>
