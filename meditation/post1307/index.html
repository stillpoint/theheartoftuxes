  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The difference lies in how you use your mind. The term 'meditation' is extremely broad and vague -- people use the word to refer to many different practices with many different aims and outcomes. So it's not possible to say definitively that "all meditation" is good or bad, unless you define 'meditation' much more clearly. You can't paint all practices with one brush.</p>
<p>When we speak strictly and eliminate a great number of practices (including many of the most popular ones that are more correctly termed <em>concentration</em> practice) we can have much more confidence in what we're talking about. Strictly speaking, meditation means keeping a mind that doesn't move. The mind perceives phenomena, but it doesn't move toward or away from them. This is what we can call <em>correct</em> meditation and <em>correct</em> use of your mind. Nothing is made up, and nothing is avoided.</p>
<p>Many people do misunderstand meditation practice. Even if they happen to stumble upon a good method, they may apply it lazily, depending on their own whims and speculations. And very commonly there is simply a basic misunderstanding of correct approach. The meditator may be basing the entire practice on the notion that something has to be gained, that some quality or state of mind or -- most commonly -- some <em>feeling</em> must be achieved and preserved.</p>
<p>This is a huge mistake that shrouds the entire practice, causes the meditator to enter into a manipulative relationship with his/her own mind, and, yes, constitutes suppression and abnormal control of sensation and emotion.</p>
<p><em>Correct</em> meditation doesn't manipulate the situation; it only perceives. "Don't touch" is the rule. Whatever arises, don't touch it, don't try to change it, don't add something to it, and don't subtract your awareness from it. This is not only safe but profoundly healing, as it allows all energies to move in their natural way to their natural ground. It is like the healing movement of nature, where wind and water are allowed to move in their own way. In the meditator's experience, not only is there not a build-up of energy due to suppression, <em>old</em> blockages also begin to flow and find their resolution.</p>
<p>And at least as importantly, in correct meditation the self-centered view is not imposed on reality. Because one refrains from manipulating experience, one's ignorance is kept from filtering plain truth. 'What is' is allowed to be, and allowed to move in its own way. Radical trust becomes wisdom, as the non-contrived view of truth begins to replace the resident narrow, self-centered, conditioned view.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong><em>Correct</em></strong> <strong>meditation is healthy and healing.</strong></p>
<p>So then the crux of the matter is: <em>can you do it?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you understand your correct compassionate, openhanded aim and function in life, and how this applies to everything you do, including meditation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you learning meditation from an acknowledged teacher, someone who can always lead you back to the correct non-grasping attitude (because they themselves have moved beyond grasping)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you learning a good, proven method with the right intended results?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you applying the learning meticulously, rather than being lax or tinkering with the method according to your own preference and assumption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have the capacity to follow the method; or is some other method or support necessary before you can practice non-manipulation?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, a strongly established habit of suppression may require therapy and other external support before you are able to sit openly by yourself. A very distracted mind may require concentration practice, or psychotherapy, or medical treatment and monitoring before it can be applied to the task. Meditation is not a cure-all; and often other courses of action are far more effective, if not downright necessary before proper meditation can be undertaken.</p>
<p>If you use your mind correctly in the moment, keeping a non-manipulative relationship with mind-world-moment, correct emotion will appear. But it means also that you mustn't <em>expect</em> to feel a certain way. For instance, by way of avoiding suppression, someone may mistakenly think that passion and drama are necessary. It plays into the ego, the self-view. You must be willing to feel or not feel, to experience fullness and emptiness and all possible qualities. You must let it all be.</p>
<p>This is called <em>openhanded presence</em>, <em>choiceless awareness</em>, and <em>Unknowing</em>.</p>
<p>The very popular concentration-style practices (commonly but not correctly called 'meditation') are very useful for beginners because most of them provide a very clear object to work with, something very clear to return to when the mind gets distracted. This distraction can happen several times a second; so a very clear object of focus and a very clear method provide the main support to prevent the mind from just spinning out into distraction.</p>
<p>Counting the breath is one example of a popular concentration-style practice. One returns to counting and abandons all other objects of experience.</p>
<p>But the issue with concentration practice is that it is inherently manipulative: you are intentionally bringing the mind back to <em>something in particular</em>. So concentration practice is easily abused by a mind that habitually controls one's experience. People often use the practice to pursue mental silence or good feeling. It is not that these are negative in themselves, but when they are pursued as the only viable reality it is harmful. It amounts to an addiction, a self-drugging.</p>
<p>So if you choose a concentration-style practice, it is all the more important to <em>understand, establish, and keep returning to correct openhanded relationship</em> with your mind and with reality. Ongoing guidance from someone who has attained the non-grasping mind is important. Receiving correct and consistent teaching (not a grab-bag of various voices) is important, to drum the lesson into you. Being checked and corrected by someone capable of it (rather than leaving it to your own tricky, unawake mind) is necessary.</p>
<p>If you are concerned with healthy practice free from doubt, these conditions are necessary. You need a good teacher and consistent teaching. Then gradually you integrate and internalize the teaching, and become liberated from doubt. As you note, doubt is the thing that keeps derailing your progress; so you need to take steps to eliminate the doubt, by creating the proper foundation of truth-based teaching in conjunction with your own unquestionable verification of that teaching, through meditative experience.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here are the great master Tilopa's <em>Six Words Of Advice</em>, which outline correct non-manipulative relationship in meditation and in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't recall</strong> (Let go of what has passed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't imagine</strong> (Let go of what may come)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't think</strong> (Let go of what is happening now)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't examine</strong> (Don't try to figure anything out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't control</strong> (Don't try to make anything happen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rest</strong> (Relax, right now, and rest)</p>
</li>
</ul>
