  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>When I hear someone lead off with "The only way...", alarm bells go off. I find that these kinds of generalizations are often an attempt on the speaker's part to <em>feel</em> like they know. (I'm not saying that's the case with the commenter here.)</p>
<p>Not that there aren't final and definitive truths, but when it comes to method there is often more than one way to get around the neighborhood. And the more real-life experience you get, the more aware you're likely to be that there's so much more you don't yet know.</p>
<p>"It's like exercise" and "give it a banana" are similar in that they're abbreviations of certain approaches. They amount to ways of getting a bunch of information across in a nutshell, or circumventing the information altogether. For people who need some kind of simple, basic explanation before they are willing to proceed, these kinds of sound bites are convenient. Often it's useful for a beginner or intermediate student to have a catchphrase to return to, to help them let go of their own doubt and rumination. When they're discouraged, they easily remember "It's like exercise", and it can help them continue.</p>
<p>But these are sort of low-level statements. They may get a person back to the task at hand, but there may be more to it once they do. These kinds of analogies and catchphrases may be useful to some and not to others. For example, if someone hates formal exercise, this kind of statement can turn them off.</p>
<p>True meditation is simply the nature of the basic mind: awake and unmoving. When we don't do something to depart from, disbelieve, or cover up our original mind, that is already meditation. But because we <em>almost always</em> depart, disbelieve, and cover up, we usually need to contrive an effort, a way to get back.</p>
<p>So although our essential nature is effortless, returning to it is sometimes not. Or at least, it requires us to repeatedly try at effortlessness.</p>
<p>These days the capacity of the average person is also not the same as it was back when many of the traditional teachings emerged. Life is far, far more complicated. Society is far, far more disconnected. We often have many layers of emotional troubles to get through, and issues of socialization that just weren't as common before the information age, and further back, before the industrialized age. There are so many distractions, so many perceived 'emergencies' vying for our attention these days.</p>
<p>Thus, much of the basis that would have been assumed in centuries past -- things like what constitutes ethical activity, or the kind of effort that is required for success in undertakings -- are not part of our common sense any more. And I think that is why catchphrases and 'tips' and seemingly empty platitudes have a more prominent role these days, to lead people to the point where they can even begin authentic practice.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, but it may be necessary. And in Buddhism, we call that <em>upaya</em>: skillful means. Teaching is adapted to the needs and level of the audience.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a cause and effect to practice. You have to keep returning to your basic, unadorned mind. You have to return to it frequently enough at first to establish it's existence; then enough to get familiar with it and gain faith in it; and finally, you stay with/as the basic mind continuously, moment to moment, and function from there.</p>
<p>Some advanced practitioners don't need phrases and strategies any more; they know what to do, and they do it. But for those of us who are still susceptible to doubt or inconsistency, we still need to steep in good teaching, good examples, rules of conduct, and guidance appropriate to our experience and level. The basic mind doesn't need it; but we need it in order to recognize and abide in basic mind.</p>
<p>I always point to the motivation behind practice as pivotal. When your life direction is clear, you are not only meditating to get some benefit for yourself; meditation becomes one of all life activities devoted to benefiting the world. So you become free of ups and downs that come with an acquisitive attitude. As Suzuki Roshi says, discouragement in practice appears when there is a gaining idea, an idea that you're getting something. The gaining attitude is always weighing what were getting against what we're losing or expending. Instead of just doing the practice in an unconditional way, we become discouraged because of our weighing and judging.</p>
<p>So one's direction has to be clarified, revisited, and established firmly. Daily contemplation of one's impermanence and one's noble purpose can gradually transform practice from a mere activity done once in a while for temporary gain, to the driving force and meaning behind everything you do. If you struggle or waver, look into your motivation, and whether you are working from a 'gaining idea'. Discipline is necessary; but right discipline isn't forcing yourself to do something, it's being meticulous about listening to your true direction, situation by situation.</p>
