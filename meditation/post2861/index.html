  <h1>meditating on a thought vs. mindfulness meditation. can someone explain?</h1>

<p>Hi; I'll answer as best I can.</p>
<p>You should be clear on when you're doing mindfulness practice and when you're doing concentration practice. Both are good, and each has unique benefits (as well as unique challenges). And they're good companion practices. But it's important to be clear on your method so that there's no room for dithering, or making deals with yourself, or compromising, or wavering between methods and states.</p>
<p>A clear and strict form may indeed be more difficult than a loose form, but that is what liberates you from your own picking and choosing: you have something (the form) that is unconditional, that doesn't depend on like and dislike, up and down, good day or bad day... something to which you can surrender all of your strategizing and manipulating.</p>
<p>So these points should be addressed in meditation practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify your purpose: what do you ~~hope~~ intend to achieve?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, this is the same as the purpose of your life. It is not expected that you will be clear on this from the very beginning. What is expected is that you keep revisiting the question with interest, sincerity, and even some urgency. "What am I here for? What is the best use of my limited time in this very fortunate situation?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Find and learn a proven (usually traditional) method that aligns with your aim.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to learn is from a master who has evolved within a lineage that passes down wisdom and teachings, and who has practiced with the method and achieved its full potential. But if you don't yet have a living teacher it can still be of benefit to try on your own. Try to learn from a reliable source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn the method well, so there is no doubt about what you should be doing with your body or mind from moment to moment, and when various situations arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice the method meticulously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are reasons for the various instructions, reasons that make sense within the tradition and context of the training, many of which may not become apparent until much later.</p>
<p>The strict form also provides very clear reflection for you. It shows you where you go off. If the form is not clear it becomes much easier to trick yourself or simply become unaware of your mind's movements.</p>
<p>So if you choose and learn a vipassana/shamatha style of breath-based meditation, you should follow that style. The aim isn't to avoid obstacles and make things easier so that you can achieve a certain state or feeling. New meditators need to give up the notion of 'feeling in the flow'. The aim is to <em>overcome</em> all obstacles with your own persistence, aspiration, and relaxation. (Not every obstacle can be overcome by pushing; many are passed merely by continuing without making a big deal of things.)</p>
<p>The breath-based meditation that concentrates on sensations at the upper lip is geared toward increasingly fine awareness of subtle sensation. Your progression through meditative states relies on this property of the method. As above, it is not expected that you will be perfect, or even consistent, at finding your concentration at the beginning. What is expected is that you stay with it, and that you let go of wandering thoughts like "maybe this isn't working" and "maybe there's a trick or another method that would work better for me".</p>
<p>That kind of perseverance is not always easy to maintain. That's one reason why you would seek out a teacher, a practice group, a space dedicated to meditation, and a commitment to a schedule of training: all of these serve as extremely valuable and effective supports for your perseverance. They also serve to enhance the <em>quality</em> of your meditation, and likely help you to concentrate at a more subtle level. And of course, the teacher's ongoing, in-the-moment guidance and mere presence are of incalculable value to you.</p>
<p>Some meditations do focus on the forehead; it's not that it's necessarily a bad practice. But it comes with risks. It's more of a yogic energy-based practice (found in some Indian Hindu, Tibetan Buddhist, and Chinese Taoist traditions, for instance). Any practice where you're manipulating energy without a reliable external guide is basically playing with fire. The reason is that you're (<em>we're all</em>) starting from a place of ignorance and lack of equanimity and self-control. Even fairly advanced meditators may have huge blind spots; they may still be at the mercy of their ego — habitually and unconsciously following their like and dislike here and there, if not for the clarity of their practice form.</p>
<p>So it's not only that messing around with energy plays into the unconscious manipulative and power-seeking tendencies of the ego, but if you factor in the fact that you're giving yourself free rein to change the method according to your whim or 'best guess', it's as if you're willfully conjuring a monster, a being that has permission to indulge in unconscious power-chasing.</p>
<p>In addition, the mere fact that attention is held at the forehead may be completely inappropriate and unbalancing for some people. In particular, young men are often forbidden this practice for their own safety since they already tend to have strong <em>Yang</em> energy that rises and flares; the practice would just inflame that, rather than counterbalance it. (Led by a master, they would more likely be assigned a practice that focuses on what is called the <em>lower dantien</em>, in the lower belly.)</p>
<p>So for several reasons I recommend against concentrating on the forehead. You don't yet have strength or subtlety of concentration; that could cause problems. You aren't yet clear on your aim or method; <em>that</em> could cause problems. The practice itself could unbalance your energy; then what would you do; what skill do you have in bringing yourself out of mental chaos or quenching a flaming pain that appears? It's like trying to ride a motorcycle without first knowing the rules of the road or how to stop it.</p>
<p>If you feel strongly that the breath meditation is not for you, you can change. There are many, many forms; and many (not all) of them are very good, and can help you center yourself as well as take you along the path of liberation.</p>
<p>If you feel strongly that you want to explore meditation on the forehead (as in <em>upper dantien</em>, third eye, sixth chakra, or 'seat of the soul' meditations), in my opinion you <em>must</em> practice with a good teacher. The teacher must be both experienced and trustworthy; and you have to do your research on this. Some teachers are very accomplished and experienced, and can open up strange new worlds for you, but they are also irresponsible or even sinister, preying on your energy. This is not uncommon!</p>
<p>Another warning I hope you take to heart from the very beginning: those strange new worlds that open with some energy meditations mean nothing! Special energy, special abilities, special visions only tend to lead to self-aggrandizement. You get something other people don't seem to have, and you start thinking highly of yourself. This is the opposite of liberation!</p>
<p>All special states and dimensions only come from mind. The source of mind is what you must know and attain. Everything else is dross, impurity that appears as a side-effect of the spiritual process. It would go much better for you if you simply avoid getting sidetracked from the very beginning. If you follow this guidance, you will thank me profoundly for it later in your career, as you compare the value of true insight to the empty nature of fancy experiences.</p>
<p>On the topic of nice, relaxing forehead tingles: this is common among meditators. Usually it is what is called 'qi effect', the feeling of local buildup or release as energy either backs up at a blockage or passes through it. The appropriate relationship with the blockage and sensation is to relax and let go of engagement. You may already notice how tempting it is to go into the feeling and try to make it bigger. This is an example of the sort of bait-and-hook quality of energy practice. It easily diverts you from your true purpose in meditation.</p>
<p>It's not that you need to avoid this sensation or think of it as bad or undesirable. But please use and train your equanimity. <strong>Don't touch!</strong> is the rule. Whatever appears, don't touch it. Whatever starts to pass away, don't touch it. Whatever lingers, don't touch it. In meditation, only follow the method. In daily life, only follow the situation. This is correct meditation and correct life. Then your true wisdom and activity will appear by themselves.</p>
<p>I'm sorry/not sorry that I can't tell you to either continue with the breath meditation or stop and choose another one. It is up to you to clarify your purpose, to research practices and teachers, and to use your rational judgment and inner intuition in deciding which course to pursue.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, commit to the decision with confidence. If you keep moving with confidence you will be like water that eventually finds its way around obstacles. See how water piles up behind a blockage until it overflows and passes it. Witness how sparrows energetically persevere at chirping, morning after morning. Watch how a figure skater keeps skating after a slip. If you keep going, no obstacle will be insurmountable.</p>
