  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>You're already okay. All these things happening are okay; they are just the movement of the world, including the process of you learning how to <em>be</em> okay. Without the difficulties you couldn't learn to be okay, and without limitations you couldn't learn to be free.</p>
<p>So Daisetz Suzuki, the great scholar of Zen, wrote "Freedom is that the elbow doesn't bend outward."</p>
<p>I find this exceptionally beautiful and inspiring. Usually we think that freedom means we get whatever we want, and even the laws of nature should be bent to our desire and bidding. But that's our <em>attachment</em>, not our freedom. When we have an elbow that bends just as it bends, <em>that</em> is our freedom.</p>
<p>Very wonderful.</p>
<p>So you can say that tinnitus is freedom. When there's nothing made up around it — trying to manipulate it, trying to avoid it, trying to cover it up, wishing it weren't there — then the truth of what it is, is freedom.</p>
<p>Concentration on the breath is a valid practice. Since you're doing concentration practice, tinnitus can help you. If you want to practice concentration on the breath, you can use it as a goad. Let the inner sound drive you toward your object of concentration. Let it impel you deeper into it, into extremely close, intimate, moment-to-moment contact with the breath object.</p>
<p>The subtle pattern is that the attention departs from the object of concentration and checks the situation: "Am I concentrating yet? How well is it going? Is tinnitus still there; is it a problem?" And then of course, very quickly the reactivity: "Goddamit! Yup, there it is; it's still there. Still a problem."</p>
<p>This checking habit has to be dismantled, released. Often, no doubt, you will even leave the object of concentration <em>in order</em> to check on the tinnitus. You may have a perfectly fine moment of concentration, perceiving the breath quite clearly, but then you aren't satisfied with it. You need to check what the tinnitus is doing, so you depart the practice and go look, and you are disappointed and disturbed, and then the reactive cycle of tension is rejoined.</p>
<p>Why leave the perfectly fine moment of concentration? Because it is not trusted. It is plain and empty, and there is no work for the ego in it. The ego wants to exist, wants to control; so it prefers drama to emptiness. The ego would rather wail at the injustice of the situation than let it go and have peace. So the ego's method and pattern, in part, is to depart the simple moment and check what else is going on.</p>
<p>You can turn this around. It is as if you have a dharma hall monitor watching over you every moment. You know, in practice temples a strong-minded, alert senior student is assigned as the monitor of the practice, to see that people are living up to the standards of the temple. The monitor makes sure people are not wavering or nodding off in drowsiness. He or she checks the posture and the general energy of practice. If the form is not upheld, the monitor quickly corrects it. In some temples, the monitor will also carry a stick to help wake people up.</p>
<p>So your tinnitus can be considered your monitor. As long as you are thinking about your tinnitus, you know that you are not doing your concentration practice. So you can use it as an extremely consistent signal to return to your chosen object of concentration. (As I said in my previous post, there are other ways of working with it; but this is another.) You are fortunate to always have the signal: come back, come back, come back, come back. Pay attention to the breath, pay attention to the breath, pay attention to the breath, pay attention to the breath.</p>
<p>It's not that the sound has to disappear. And in fact, if you get the gist of this way of using your situation you can be thankful that the sound continues. But each time you <em>think</em> about the sound, make a judgment about it, react to it, you can use that as a cue to immediately return to attention on the breath object.</p>
<p>This approach is sometimes used in relation to pain, whether it's some pain of illness or injury or the ongoing leg and back pain of sitting. One very experienced meditator wrote about his leg injury and pain, and his teacher's urging to go into the 'Diamond Pain Samadhi' — using the pain to drive him deeper and deeper into concentration. The more unbearable the pain, the deeper it drove him. And he did achieve a profound experience of samadhi (radical, effortless unification) through that process.</p>
<p>(Of course, this method runs the risk of maiming the body; so one must be clear about the trade-off, and decide that the benefit outweighs the cost. There are other ways that are more caring of the body, and no less profound.)</p>
<p>If you get the hang of this approach maybe you can get Diamond Sound Samadhi.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>On a separate point, I want to emphasize the importance of learning one good, proven traditional method from a good, proven source. There are many different forms of breath meditation. Some differences are obvious, some are subtle. Different methods may also have differing aims.</p>
<p>It is important to be very clear on what you are doing. When you know with complete confidence what you should be doing with your mind at any moment, then you can just do it. You can drop the whole world. Nothing else is important in that moment; only your practice.</p>
<p>But if you have some bit of doubt or hesitation, other concerns and distractions find their way in. Your relinquishment of them is not so clear, your returning not so quick nor consistent; and the whole meditation suffers the great, tragic, frustrating sickness of 'in-between practice' — trying, but not completely; neither in nor out. This is indeed hell-like. So it is important to do what needs to be done to be free of doubt in meditation.</p>
