  <h1>Question for people who practice</h1>

<p>One of the big problems you may run into if you don't get proper instruction is the attitude of chasing after a particular state.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to seek your ideal state of mind — peaceful, non-reactive, comfortable — and try to get it and keep it. But that attitude fails to relate well to all of the other states of mind that <em>will</em> arise, and it keeps the ideal state always outside: you become the seeker, and the state of mind becomes what is sought, and so this separation is developed and reinforced. You miss the reality that you and your state of mind are not separate, and that there's nothing outside to get.</p>
<p>This is an example of how we bring our own old patterns to new endeavors. Even if meditation is supposed to be liberating, we tend to relate to it through our own conditioning, through the filters we keep in place, through the narrow view we hold, through the habitual ways of seeing and relating that have become our reality. Without a very capable guide to provide the outside perspective, it is a certainty that we will fall prey to our own old ways of seeing and doing.</p>
<p>In any case, take care not to think of freedom from anxiety as an ideal state you need to get. Rather, you <em>practice</em> freedom from anxiety. Whatever method you end up learning, openhandedness is vital. Cultivate openhandedness with all experiences, all thoughts, all moods, all situations. Anything can come and go; you just keep returning to the method, without forcing anything to be there or forcing anything to go away. Do you understand this attitude?</p>
<p>That is already freedom. A thought and associated feeling may arise and may linger; but you decide that it doesn't have the power to move your mind from your meditation. So it is not that you require the situation to be different than it is. Instead, you tap into your own not-moving mind, that part of you that is always open and stable, like space.</p>
<p>In an open room or in open space, anything can happen; the space itself isn't disturbed. Only if you attach to the thing that's appearing will you be disturbed. So if you attach to an unpleasant event, you abandon your spacious mind; you give mere appearance the power to move you.</p>
<p>I also would suggest that you don't think of meditation only as a tool to calm yourself in times of trouble. If you look at it this way you will never develop the mind to a point of stability. You have to practice at other times, in both lovely circumstances and difficult ones, to develop the ability to let go of appearance and return to your spacious mind. It is necessary to prepare before the crisis hits.</p>
<p>When you are triggered by an event, it is already very late to be thinking of calming yourself or being mindful. Already something has come in and moved your mind. That time is the most difficult time to try and regain your center. It is much better if you are mindful enough not to be swayed by the event in the first place: you can feel the displeasure, but you don't have to be attached to it. This means that your mind has to become spacious, or smooth, so things don't cling to it. This takes ongoing practice, not just a one-shot magic tool.</p>
<p>Another difficulty with practicing only on your own, picking and choosing your own favorite style, is that you will have doubt. You don't yet know the purpose of all the instructions. You don't yet know what the fruition of the practice entails. So at times when a clear, decisive action is required you will be prone to wavering and doubt.</p>
<p>In meditation, you must not get caught up in appearance; don't try to manipulate. But people who try to figure it out as they go naturally try to check how it's going and tweak their experience. If it 'doesn't feel right' they will try to change something; if it 'feels good' they will think it's going well. Neither one is necessarily the case; they are both attachment to appearance.</p>
<p>So you should find a good, proven method; receive the instruction and learn it well; and follow the method meticulously, without picking and choosing.</p>
<p>The famous Zen teaching <em>Faith In Mind</em> (Hsin Hsin Ming) says:</p>
<p>&gt;The Great Way is not difficult for those who do not pick and choose.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is the practice of being present. It will help you avoid losing yourself; it will help you not to be overtaken by anxiety and frustration. But it requires that you show up for all events and experiences, without editing, without picking and choosing.</p>
<p>I recommend keeping some awareness of your feet on the ground throughout the day. This will give you a sense of having a ground, a root, a place in life; and that naturally makes you less reactive. it will also help you to be more aware of the things that would ordinarily trigger you automatically. If you are aware, you can choose to disengage, to relax, to breathe, etc.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
