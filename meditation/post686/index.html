  <h1>Need advice for a self-run meditation retreat.</h1>

<p>I've done many group and solo retreats, so maybe I can offer some suggestions.</p>
<p>Unless you are exceptionally motivated and experienced, doing only meditation throughout the day will not be sustainable. Your schedule of meditating from 9:30 to 2:00pm also seems like it may be difficult for someone new to retreats. Although a personal retreat is a time to express your effort, more balance of activities may make your time go better.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, reading is one of the worst activities to schedule after meditation. In a few minutes of reading you may undo hours of practice.</p>
<p>I would suggest a very firm schedule of meditation morning, mid-day, and evening, interspersed with simple physical activities. The activities can actually take most of the day; if you push yourself too much into meditation your mind will rebel and you will leave the retreat. If there is some manual labor you can do for most of the day, wonderful: raking leaves, gardening, renovating, cleaning, tidying. I used to take a garbage bag and gloves to the beach and just pick up litter for a couple hours a day. Silent walking, running, swimming, biking â€” also wonderful. Don't go so far afield that you then start to engage with and think about the external world.</p>
<p>By that token, I strongly recommend doing without the internet and blogs and forums and all electronic connections. You have to decide strongly <em>what is your purpose</em> in doing this retreat, and stick to it. You do not need motivation from others. You can search for motivation the other 360 days in the year if you want. A solo retreat means you find your <em>own</em> strength, your <em>own</em> resources.</p>
<p>Realize that you don't need external aids; you are already complete. You just don't often have a chance to experience and express that original completion. Keep quiet and stay to yourself during retreat, and you will get something much better than anyone else can give you.</p>
<p>Although I recommend against all reading, I know that when the mind desperately wants "relief" from practice one may seek the lesser of many evils, so to speak, and one may think that at least engaging with wise and positive speech would be better than completely flying off the handle and taking in dime store novels, tv shows, video games, etc. The very activity of consuming words stirs the mind and diverts you from your aim of self-sufficiency. If possible, do more simple physical activity rather than reading. If you choose to read, set an alarm and limit your time, and don't go a minute more. Also choose one single theme rather than fantasizing that you're going to download a bunch of wisdom; stick to one book, one topic. You may find that reading itself becomes unsatisfying. Don't then try to consume more. Change the channel and do something else: stretching, walking, even a timed nap. Your reading is not wisdom; your unknowing is wisdom.</p>
<p>If you can spend time in natural settings without having to engage with ideas, machines, or people, that would be ideal. Going on a mindful walk or rest in nature will be much more sustainable than forcing repeated sittings, but your mind will settle nonetheless if you avoid distraction. And since you are without a teacher or retreat leader, a natural setting can provide the guidance and teaching â€” <em>if</em> you refrain from discursive thinking. It sinks in without you even being aware of it.</p>
<p>Blogging will just encourage your inner dialog to continue. Don't try to analyze or sum up or glorify your experience. Don't think about what it all means or try to get a realization. Only keep a good relationship with the moment and let your body, mind, and energy settle down, down, down.</p>
<p>Let go of words.</p>
<p>Monastics are clever in their activities. Only one style of meditation is difficult to sustain, so they sit, and walk, and sit, and walk; then some mantra, some chanting, some bowing, some working.... You may want to schedule some bowing and mantra in addition to whatever meditation method you use.</p>
<p>Your main method should remain the main method â€” returning to it repeatedly digests your experience and turns it into wisdom. This is one of the great products of a solo retreat; your extended and repeated relationship with a single method gives you experience that's hard to replicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Beginning and ending the day (or every session) with Metta is wonderful. When your heart is offered to all beings, your own little drama is not so impactful, and your retreat has energy. Being obsessed with your own personal situation is very easy to fall into in solo retreat, so Metta practice will be helpful to you as well as to all others.</p>
<p>Your schedule also seems a bit... late. Waking up earlier and going to bed earlier will be healthier and your personal energy will be more in tune with the energy of the day. Pre-dawn is actually a great time for practice. "Liver time" â€” the time of regeneration â€” starts around 11pm, so it's best to be asleep already at that time.</p>
<p>That's great that you are eating healthy food in and out of retreat. The simpler the better, just so that you don't have to be occupied first by doing a big preparation, then by eating, then by cleaning up. If that's part of your work period, fine; but on solo retreat I usually try to have a rice cooker full of grain and then just something simple to eat besides that.</p>
<p>I urge you not to think of achieving anything or being anything over a span of time. Change to a momentary relationship where you just repeatedly let go of the grip and return to the issue of the moment, whatever it is. Meditation time: meditate. Running time: run. The more clear your schedule and environment, the more help you will have in returning. Only follow the schedule, the method, and the current situation.</p>
