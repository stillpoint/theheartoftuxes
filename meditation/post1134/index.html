  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'm wary of stepping into something here... (LOL)</p>
<p>OK, on the last point, let me ask you: do you understand enlightenment? If you don't, how will you understand what I mean by enlightened teacher; and why then should I use the term? If you do understand, then you already understand what it means to have an enlightened teacher.</p>
<p>Of course, having an enlightened/awakened teacher is very exceptionally wonderful. Even one meeting can be life-changing; and frequent interaction has a continuously transformative effect. In some traditions like Hinduism and other Indo-Tibetan streams it is held that simply being in the presence of an enlightened being can tame your mind. This is the tradition of <em>darshan</em> or 'glimpsing the Divine'.</p>
<p>One of the main functions of a teacher, beyond just presenting certain material in a certain beneficial order, is to reliably hold the view beyond ego. We can't do this for ourselves, most of us; so we are fairly blessed to have a relationship with someone who can hold that view for us. Many enlightened beings can hold that view continuously, among their many other exceptional qualities. But even many unenlightened but experienced teachers can reliably <em>return</em> to that view. That is the important thing: even if they sometimes stray, they can quickly find their bearings when it comes to teaching and embodying the enlightened view.</p>
<p>So it's wonderful to have an enlightened teacher, but also wonderful simply to have a teacher who can return to clarity.</p>
<p>And even among more common people there are some who are sincere, and who have a very clear and stable life direction in service of others, and who have learned and digested a significant portion of their chosen spiritual path. Sometimes their teacher or their institution will recognize their qualification to teach certain things: they may be certified to teach the basics of meditation as well as some levels scriptural study or, say, some aspects of yoga practice. They won't be responsible for seeing you all the way through to enlightenment, but they can transmit much of <em>their</em> experience to you.</p>
<p>There are many beneficial teachers, with many different levels of attainment. Sometimes the faults and failings of a teacher become a blessing, allowing them to better relate to you and your problems and your way of seeing things. Sometimes witnessing a teacher make a mistake and then correct it, deal with any shame and embarrassment, and proceed clearly can be a tremendous lesson and inspiration that you wouldn't get with a more 'perfect' teacher. It can connect you to your humanity; it can broaden your compassionate heart and your notion of what the path embraces. Because there will be times when <em>you</em> are that person, trying and failing; and you need to learn how to keep moving onward nevertheless.</p>
<p>&gt;Learn meditation properly from one proven, certified, traditional, living source of teaching.</p>
<p>There are many teachers/sources of learning that aren't proven, certified, traditional, or living (like books, etc.). Of these, some are still good teachers, and some (many?) are not. But satisfying these conditions gives you a better chance of a study situation that can take you all the way to liberation.</p>
<p>By <em>proven</em>, I mean that their path and method have been proven over centuries by many practitioners, and that they have proven their dedication, sincerity, and compassionate direction with their actions over years of practice and service.</p>
<p>By <em>certified</em>, I mean that there is a system of oversight: <em>their</em> teachers and/or institution have recognized their ability to teach certain material (and in some cases, their awakening to true nature). They have been observed, they have been tested, and they have been formally approved to teach. And in all but the most lofty cases they will continue to be tracked and supported by the community of teachers. (But once a person becomes a Zen Master, for instance, they may begin to follow their own path and make changes to the tradition without a big risk of leading others astray.)</p>
<p>By <em>traditional</em>, I mean that they, their practice, and their teacher are grounded in an ongoing stream, a lineage that flows like a river from the past. They are not merely speculating, but in their mind, speech, and action they channel the wisdom and blessings of enlightened beings who have gone before them.</p>
<p>By <em>living</em>, I mean that you can meet them face to face and allow real, spontaneous, unimaginable interactions to appear between you. Both enlightenment and humanity can be modeled for you at any moment. Living spirituality is bright and vivid and lush, not merely conceptual. It reaches deep into you, deeper than you can know.</p>
<p>This is the ideal teacher-student situation. One ought to do whatever it takes to seek it out. But if there are (temporarily) insurmountable obstacles, one may make compromises on some of these points in order to gain immediate benefit and accumulate conditions until such a time as one can find the ideal.</p>
