  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Yes, it depends on the method you're practicing. There are also various kinds of breathing-based meditation, with various purposes. So the best course might be to find a live teacher who can convey the practice in detail and field any questions you may have.</p>
<p><em>In general</em> (if you have no other guidance to go on) the gaze is directed softly down at an angle -- forward the floor, but not necessarily focusing on anything in particular. You're not burning laser beams into a spot on the floor with your eyes, you're just letting them rest and inviting the gaze to softly take in whatever it happens to take in.</p>
<p>As you set up your posture, go through the various points, seeing that everything is aligned well and upright and relaxed, let the gaze softly take in the area of the floor in front of you, and then forget about it -- soon you will bring your attention to the breath anyway, so it's not necessary to check what's happening with the eyes.</p>
<p>Just where to direct the eyes depends somewhat on the posture. You don't want your head tilted down or jutting forward, as that puts strain on the neck and shoulders. The common instruction says to gaze about three feet in front of you, but that's quite arbitrary. If you set up your posture well and then let your eyes settle, they'll find their own natural alignment.</p>
<p>The downward gaze promotes calmness and introspection. Recently we're hearing a lot more about the connection between the direction in which the eyes are turned and the parts of the brain being accessed; but this is old yogic knowledge. Ancient meditative traditions know a lot about using the eyes to direct energy. Hindu yoga, for instance may have a meditator look up toward the brow, to help bring energy to the nexus in the forehead. Taoist yoga may have the meditator looking sideways and up and down as energy circulates through various meridians. Here, we are sort of letting go of the reins and being very openhanded, not trying to control or direct things, but letting ourselves settle down and just <em>watch</em>, watch the breath.</p>
<p>There's also a strong tradition of facing a wall and gazing straight ahead. This tends to engender a more alert quality. You shouldn't be tinkering with your feeling or mental state; but in some cases, like during retreat or intensive private practice, if you find yourself nodding off or becoming dull you can raise the direction of vision to straight ahead, and that will help you stay awake. The eyelids remain relaxed and half-closed, but the line of sight is raised.</p>
<p>The standard lower gaze helps you settle down, which most people need, because their minds are too active. For a more experienced and stable meditator, eyes straight ahead might bring a brighter quality with it, but the possible disadvantage is that it can also allow more jitter or tension to appear.</p>
<p>So each choice has its advantages and disadvantages. For the most part, we forget about tinkering with external things and bring our attention to the meditation, to the breath. We work everything out by returning to the method. This develops independence and freedom. If we mess about with externals we remain attached, always looking for illusory control rather than really learning how to live <em>with</em> every situation. Let go, and return to the method. Let be, and return to the method.</p>
<p>Regarding sounds -- and this is also a generalization; and you should again find a living teacher who can teach you a complete method -- the same soft, open, non-attaching, non-manipulating attitude applies. Let the hearing be soft. It takes in whatever it takes in, and you don't have to check how it's going. Only return attention to the method, to the breath. Every time attention is taken away, no big deal -- just quickly and gently return.</p>
<p>The correct relationship with the senses is "don't touch". No need to do anything in particular, neither grasping nor avoiding. Don't touch. Let it be.</p>
<p>At some point you may find that you've experienced a deeper silence, a comfortable if not blissful moment of unity or a quieting of the senses. This 'noticing' amounts to a distraction from the method, so at that moment, just gently and instantly drop all grasping and return to the method. It's not that these experiences are either incorrect or ideal; you just refuse to get dazzled by them. Keep returning to the method, and let everything else be.</p>
<p>Some methods may recommend 'noting'. Theravada Buddhist meditations are sometimes taught this way. It is a sort of intermediate step to letting go. I don't recommend it, as it's an extra step, superfluous. But if it's included in the instruction you follow, you should do it. Learn <em>one</em> method well. Mixing methods leads to confusion, which soon sabotages the whole process.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? If you learn differently from a teacher, disregard this instruction and only follow the teacher. Each proven, traditional path has its own integrity, it's own reasons for presenting the teaching in that particular way.</p>
