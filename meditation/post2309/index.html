  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Is it because of a certain posture or arrangement of your body, or is it because there's constant pain... or something else?</p>
<p>For instance, sometimes we can just hold the idea "I'm in pain", even if the pain itself comes and goes, leaving you sometimes without pain. The story persists, while the sensation is transient.</p>
<p>If pain overwhelms your ability to concentrate — if it dominates your attention and takes it away from the object of concentration (the breath in your case) — there are a couple of common strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go deeper. Increase the concentration.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this sounds a bit like "just say no"; but it's valid to put more effort into concentration. You may like to hear this; you may be very happy to receive this invitation. You may want to go deeper and at some level know that you can, but maybe you haven't given yourself permission to do so.</p>
<p>Or maybe you didn't realize that you could, or that you might be expected to; so receiving the invitation could come as a wonderful surprise. "Oh, even pain doesn't have to distract me." Then you can fully let go of the story about 'your pain', and just be with what is. You can decide what's important; and if you decide that at meditation time meditation is most important, you can free yourself of much of the wavering and figuring that happens at other times. No thought is more significant. No condition has power to take you away. If you believe it, you can make it so.</p>
<p>But if you take this route you have to do it gently. It's a skill, a knack — to return very immediately and very certainly, but also gently. Don't fight your mind. This is another instance of not letting circumstances have power over your mind. "Nothing has the power to make me react. I won't take the bait. I won't give up easy-going presence."</p>
<p>If you fight your mind, that is also a story; it is the story of one 'you' against another 'you'. But this moment, you are complete. Your mind state is complete. Your body is complete. Pain is complete. Even distraction is complete, when you realize it and return.</p>
<p>In this strategy, pain becomes a great gift. You can reach depths you never thought possible, because pain becomes your constant teacher. If you waver, you become susceptible; so you learn not to waver.</p>
<ol>
<li>If pain invades your concentration on the breath and always seems to be pressing for attention — if despite your best effort you can't seem to keep a constant stream of attention — you can shift attention to the pain itself and use it as an object of concentration.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has a skillful aspect to it because the more intense and obvious the pain, the more clear an object it becomes.</p>
<p>Again, take care to distinguish between the story and inner dialogue, and the sensation itself. What we name and <em>think</em> about what's happening is usually very different from the experience itself. When you look into the location, quality, and scope of the sensation, you may find many surprising revelations. You may realize that pain is not pain; it may appear as some other physical or energetic phenomenon — vibration, pressure, contraction or expansion... some nameless organic quality.... Listening closely to pain can have something of the quality of observing the Northern Lights or watching shadows and light move within clouds; it can be subtle or terrible or heart-meltingly sad and beautiful; or it can be just plain, just regular; or it can drift out of the grasp of awareness and disappear. You don't know. You just listen, feel.</p>
<p>Channel the energy and attention you might otherwise put into victim or hero stories ("poor me" or "I'm so great") and other inner dialogue, into listening to the reality of the so-called 'pain'.</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase your inner comfort and acceptance.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can rearrange your posture and supports (cushions, blankets, straps, chair, etc.); but that's not what this strategy is about. This is not about manipulating outer things, but about adjusting your mind and letting go of the things you hold.</p>
<p>Whatever discomfort or agitation is foremost in your awareness at any time, increase your comfort in relation to it. Often this goes along with a physical softening. For instance, we usually unconsciously tense up around an injury; so having a more comfortable and accepting attitude toward the sensation of pain may be accompanied by a release of tension, softening the muscles and tendons around the injury, relaxing and smoothing the breath, settling downward with gravity, and so on. Often one may follow tension through the body and defuse it repeatedly, sinking into greater and greater relaxation.</p>
<p>This strategy also has some very skillful aspects to it. First of all, you realize quickly that you have some control. You don't necessarily control the fact of the injury or pain, but you control your attitude toward it. Increasing your sense of comfort, you may find that it can deepen almost endlessly; you may even enter blissful states.</p>
<p>Secondly, this practice forms a positive feedback loop. It encourages presence very naturally because you're always moving in the direction of something pleasant and easy to receive. Who doesn't want to experience more comfort?</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people might temporarily switch practices to a method with more structure and support. For instance, when performing mantra practice you have a very clear form — you repeat a specific set of syllables. In addition, you can use your voice to help you, speaking the syllables out loud and also hearing them externally as you speak. And even further, you can use a mala (string of meditation beads) to provide kinesthetic and tactile anchors as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some paths will add even further elements. For example, in Vajrayana Buddhism one uses three bases of practice: body, speech, and mind; so one may perform an activity like working a mala, turning a prayer wheel, or sounding both a hand drum and a bell (one in each hand), while speaking a mantra, <em>and</em> also visualizing a very detailed scene of a deity and her/his surroundings and actions.</p>
<p>The risk in changing methods is that you open the door for doubt and self-fighting. Doubt, because you may then question which method is 'better' (neither is better; just choose one and do it). Self-fighting, because you may conceive of the new method as a way to <em>avoid</em> or <em>destroy</em> your experience rather than embrace it. So whatever method you choose should be performed with an openhanded, compassionate attitude: this is okay, and that is okay; anything can come, anything can stay, anything can pass away.</p>
<p>Many other strategies exist. Someone very accustomed to using breath in practice might work with pain in concert with breath. There are many possibilities, from many traditions.</p>
<p>Which strategy do you like?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>"Thank you, pain, for reminding me of my dependence and impermanence. Without you, I would arrogantly continue living in mindlessness; but you help me return to vulnerability and sincerity, and you help me make use of my limited time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, pain, for teaching me compassion. You are my individual gateway to all the pain in the universe, all the suffering of countless other beings. Experiencing my own helplessness and agitation, I feel pity for all others who suffer, and a vow grows within me to help them all move beyond the mind that is enslaved to pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>"Thank you, pain, for showing me that happiness doesn't depend on your presence or absence."</p>
