  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It depends on the capacity and the aspiration. Someone who is just learning the ropes and is not yet stable in practice shouldn't push. Yes, it is possible to do practice even through tremendous pain. (I and many others here, I'm sure, can attest.) Given the right mental and formal approach it can be very comforting to meditate when in pain. One can let go of all that exhausting resistance, all that complexity of mind that becomes overwhelming in times of pain, and take care of the simple moment.</p>
<p>From the other side, pain can bring one to focus in ways that are difficult to achieve otherwise. If one is committed to concentration and has developed some aptitude for it, one can find a very beautiful still point within the pain. Not away from it! Within it. It is very silent and peaceful. The pain itself doesn't necessarily go away, but there is peace-bliss available nonetheless.</p>
<p>Even if one can concentrate and release enough to let all the internal channels open and energy move freely, thus relieving the pain, one should not <em>try</em> to relieve the pain with meditation. Or I should say that if one is using meditation that way, it should be clear; it should be a separate practice at a separate time. Correct meditation has no gaining idea. Nothing to get, nothing to avoid. Only openhanded awareness, moment to moment, regardless of what the moment brings.</p>
<p>Many beginners make the mistake of heroically taking on too much. Their aspiration is high, but their capacity is not yet high. And what often results is that they finally experience the breaking point, where either they can't take any more or some actual damage is done. Some balance and wisdom is necessary. One should listen to the body, one should perceive the overall situation without making opinions. All those who are starting out on their own, I urge them to take this to heart. We read stories of great deeds by great beings, we fantasize (and not unreasonably) about making progress and breaking through and transforming ourselves, we may even be pushed a bit too much by other practitioners or (heaven forbid!) a teacher.</p>
<p>There is a big grey area here. On one hand, our indulgence has to be uprooted. We really have no conception — literally no idea — of our true potential. This is because our true potential is boundless and beyond conception. In practical terms, it very often means that we can do much more than we think we can do. A good teacher knows this through her/his own experience, through the experience of teaching others, and often by seeing you more clearly than you see yourself. When working with a teacher and group, you need to do the proper research to be able to let go of doubt and commit appropriately: once it's reasonable to do so, you let go of second-guessing the teacher, and you only try.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, we've seen many difficulties and injuries arising from a poor balance between a student's capacity and an ideal being promoted. In some cases this comes from a culture clash: certain cultures involve meditative (and other) discipline from an early age; so people in that culture naturally have a different capacity as far as meditation goes. Certain basics may be assumed to already be present. A Tibetan teacher may expect that you already have a compassionate aspiration. A Japanese teacher may expect a certain level of self-discipline. When decadent Western culture meets traditional meditative culture, sometimes we push ourselves without having the basis for progress. This can also be true of people who start practice on their own, learning from books or online sources: the ideal outstrips the reality. Therefore, on this side of the issue you have to let go of second-guessing <em>yourself</em>.</p>
<p>This is a practice of very even-minded, practical review of one's situation. Without fooling yourself: what will contribute more to your awakening and peace of mind? Is it time to practice or is it time to rest?</p>
<p>The Tibetan <em>lojong</em> mind training has an aphorism that says "Of the two masters, follow the primary one." This means that you have to develop confidence and let go of second-guessing. Yes, you have to listen closely to the teaching and follow your master's advice meticulously. But if there is a conflicting inner message you should confidently follow the inner master, the primary one: your own wisdom mind.</p>
<p>If there is doubt about what kinds of activities are okay for migraine, your friend should consult a neurologist. I am very confident that a neurologist would say pretty much what I'm saying here, that there is certainly no harm if meditation is not overdone (say, for hours at a time if one is not used to sitting for that duration). Even in that case, it wouldn't be the meditation doing the harm, but rather the neglect of other necessary things like change of posture, eating, relaxing, and so on. Meditation is actually recommended by migraine researchers as part of an overall lifestyle strategy to maintain that brain chemistry balance. Regular meditation is effective for a great many migraine sufferers. But I am not the one to give the final word on this; your friend's doctor or chosen health professional is.</p>
<p>Practice-wise, there is no harm whatsoever in sitting with pain, except for the possible feeling of defeat and dejection that can come with doing too much too soon. As the capacity grows due to consistent practice, one can take on more and more, until there is really no situation whatsoever that can't be met meditatively. But if the pain is a message from the body that something is wrong, you must attend to it. Don't let custom or even someone's seniority lead you to injury. This usually has more to do with muscle-joint issues such as sitting through serious knee pain; but who knows what may be happening in anyone's bodymind, or the messages the bodymind sends in order to initiate healing?</p>
<p>Besides capacity, aspiration is also a key factor. What is your friend's aim and level of motivation? If it is not special, he shouldn't push. Take it easy; be well; cultivate peace of mind whether doing meditation or whether resting in the dark. If there is very high and pure motivation, the meditator can face almost anything. The great master Shunryu Suzuki Roshi called this pure motivation 'beginner's mind'. The mind that only wants to try, without expectation, can face and overcome tremendous obstacles. The problem that many actual beginners run into is that their beginner's mind comes and goes. They start out like a bronco out of the gate, but soon flag. Then, by comparison, the pared down effort seems disappointing. So in this we can take a cue from musicians and other performers: "Always leave them wanting more." It is better in the beginning to do a little, and do it regularly, and always <em>want</em> to do more... than to do too much, do it erratically, and end up not wanting any more practice.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>An added point: Your friend should choose his meditation style. Breath-based meditation is appropriate for most, but may not be his best or favorite style. In that case, there are other practices that can be enjoyed.</p>
<p>One risk of starting out without regular access to a teacher is that the method can be off, or can go off, or the approach can have a subtle acquisitive nature to it, or the pain or anxiety about pain can prompt an imbalance in the breath. Any of these can impact the breath, and thus the brain chemistry. So keep that in mind. It might be inherently simpler to try a method that focuses on something else, leaving the breath to do its own thing naturally. Mantra, for example, is a good practice for someone dealing with pain. It is simple, easy to do, and provides other touchstones that can be reached through the pain: the inner recitation of the mantra, the sound of one's own voice (which can be used on and off as one wishes, to help bring the mantra back and make it more clear in the awareness), and the sensation of working beads on a mala: three grounding influences that can make it easier to practice in a relaxed manner when in pain. I myself have done mantra practice many times lying sick in bed, or with head buried in a pillow due to migraine.</p>
<p>There are many possibilities for practice. Breath-based can be good; others can be good too. The main thing is keeping a just-now mind.</p>
