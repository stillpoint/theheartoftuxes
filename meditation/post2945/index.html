  <h1>['deleted by user']</h1>

<p>You should try more clear practice.</p>
<p>You have tried various methods rather than sticking to one. When you check your practice and judge it to be insufficient, you change. This keeps the picking-and-choosing mind alive. But you have to do away with that mind, and only follow the method. If you switch your approach whenever things get tough, you will never break through the tough parts.</p>
<p>And just labeling things 'tough' is already a problem. <strong>This is called</strong> <strong><em>checking</em></strong>: stepping outside of the practice to have a look at yourself and make judgments. Checking is the number one problem people have in meditation (and in life!). So you have to learn to <em>only do it</em>!</p>
<p>How did you learn the methods? Are you very clear on what the method is, how you should apply your mind at any moment and in any situation? This is important. So <strong>both the learning and the application of method should be very meticulous</strong>. When you know very well what to do, and when you do it without wavering, then the method has the chance to work and you can grow in trust of it. But if there is doubt about what to do, then wavering, then suspicion, it is difficult or impossible to develop faith and commitment that propel you past obstacles.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>practicing on your own tends to be self-limiting</strong>: you practice only to the limits of your own preference and view. You tend to find reasonable what you have always found reasonable, and you tend to find unreasonable what you have always found unreasonable. So it is difficult on your own to move beyond the habits that have always limited you.</p>
<p>Therefore you need to <strong>use external structures to help you</strong>. The foremost support, and indeed precious and powerful gift, is <strong>contact with a good, respected teacher</strong> who has attained the fruits of the method. Better yet, <strong>contact with an enlightened being</strong>. (There are many!) The degree and ways of support a good teacher provides are inconceivable.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>practice with a group of sincere seekers</strong> has many benefits you can't possible find on your own. You can be inspired. You can share your own inspiration and help, overcoming selfishness. You can see role models at every stage of the path. You can receive teachings in everyday-life contexts. And you can be supported by the schedule and form that everyone follows (rather than falling back on your own personal preference).</p>
<p>The rest of your life is also inextricably linked to meditation. It is impossible to use your bodymind in negative ways in life, and then to experience clear meditation and spiritual progress. You clear and calm your mind as much with your <strong>everyday activity</strong> as with special sessions of meditation. So learning about karma — the positive and negative causes you make, and their positive and negative results — is essential to meditative progress.</p>
<p>Finally, you can <strong>adjust the environments, relationships, and routines of your life to support you</strong>. Your mind is influenced by everything. Is your living space clear and clean and noble-minded, or does it encourage slackness and vulgarity? Do your relationships aim at peace and truth and love? Are your sleeping, eating, and physical activity in balance? These are ways you can help your mind to focus and be calm. For example, one enlightened master, Mangala Anshumati, says that proper eating can account for half our effort on the spiritual path — it is so influential.</p>
<p>In the practice session itself, use the structures of <strong>environment, ritual, and posture</strong> to help you. <strong>Clear and clean the space for practice</strong>. In the old days, with more access to natural spaces, the ideal locale was a fairly secluded glade where the sounds of wind in trees or running water would naturally calm the mind and heart. Mountains are also traditionally excellent sites for meditation. In our modern lives, we may need to create some beauty and spaciousness and flow in our living spaces to welcome that ease.</p>
<p>An <strong>altar</strong> can help you focus your intent and ignite your aspiration. You can place a sacred image on the altar — an image of an enlightened being, or a symbol of enlightenment itself. This is not to be thought of as worshipping an external god, but rather as honoring your own enlightened nature. You already have a mind that is perfectly clear; and you wish to approach it and unify with it. So besides doing that in meditation, you can do that with an altar: it is a place where you approach and unify with your original clear and compassionate nature.</p>
<p>An altar can be a whole separate table, or it can be a small area cleared on a shelf. A simple offering can be made, of water, or light, or something beautiful like a flower or fruit. This moves your energy in the right direction — in the direction of giving yourself to life rather than trying to take something from life. (It's not that you shouldn't receive good things, but that the <em>attitude</em> of grasping keeps you in your churning, suffering mind; and the <em>attitude</em> of offering moves you to your calm, content mind. In fact, starting your meditation from a place of offering rather than getting can change your meditation and your life!)</p>
<p>Doing your practice in the same way and at the same time each day creates a <strong>power of repetition</strong>. If you repeatedly apply yourself sincerely, regardless of difficulty, each new time will build on a foundation of previous efforts, and will gain power from them. If you do this very regularly there will be times when the repetition itself carries you along, when otherwise you would be at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>Posture</strong> of mind and body go together. Your body posture should be upright without being rigid. Learn correct meditation posture (another reason to study with a living teacher). The body supports the mind in awakening by taking an awake posture. The body supports the mind in relaxing by taking a relaxed posture. Meditation posture should be both awake and relaxed.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The most significant parameter of all is <em>why</em> you do your practice. If the motivation is only selfish, to get some good condition for yourself, it is inherently distracting; it perpetuates the dualistic, self-obsessed, grasping mind. If the motivation is generous, for the benefit of all, it is inherently stabilizing, as the mind finds its essential home not in the world of appearances but in radiant compassion.</p>
<p>So behind all of the structures I wrote about above is the issue of why you do practice or why you do anything in life. What is the best, most complete motivation? It must include all others, the whole universe of universes, and not be limited to narrow self-service.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I hope this helps as a fairly complete guide to beginning practice: gathering the conditions that lead to clarity.</p>
