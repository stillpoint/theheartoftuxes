  <h1>I thought the aim of meditation was to dis-identify from the mind, how is meditation involving mantra/counting useful?</h1>

<p>It is much better if you find out through your own experience, through meditation practice. Then your understanding will have a foundation of reality (i.e., your own direct life experience). When things like this are explained, there's the risk — which more often than not plays out — that the explanation will be adopted and mistaken for real understanding and attainment.</p>
<p>If you do meditation practice, then the "equation" will sink in and work together with your experience. Soon the meaning will be revealed, without having to exercise your speculative thinking about it.</p>
<p>Since you ask, though, I'll respond. Originally there is no subject and no object. The notion that you are one thing and the rest of life is another is an illusion made by your thinking. We could say that meditation and all practice aims to shed light on or upend this illusion of separate being.</p>
<p>So we habitually imagine that we are solitary beings in a world of separate things, and we even pursue spiritual practice on that basis: as if <em>we</em> are doing practice and making some<em>thing</em> happen. In fact, our entire experience is divided up because of this one illusion. Whenever we hear something, we consider that sound to be outside of ourselves. Whenever we see or feel something, those sights and feelings are thought to be outside things that happen to "us". All of our relationships are considered to be separate. How lonely!</p>
<p>As we develop understanding, our thinking may start to get the idea that we are not separate from life; but that is just an idea, and the actual experience of non-separation is something quite radically different and still beyond our grasp. But the reality of non-separation is always with us, alongside our illusion (sometimes we say it's <em>covered up</em> by our illusion or mistaken thinking). And sometimes experiences will break through and melt or shake up that whole illusory world for some moments. Being struck by great beauty or great suffering can do this: when you're wordless at the edge of the Grand Canyon, when a baby's gaze catches you between thoughts, when you lose your job or someone close to you dies.... Also, falling in love can create gaps in the illusion of separateness; and many other big or small experiences.</p>
<p>All of those experiences happen to you, seemingly by grace or fate. You stumble upon them, and then they dissipate and you're back to the illusion. But you can pursue the central point of this illusion, examine it closely, and bring your own determination to bear on it. This is called practice. Proper study and reasoning can help you realize that a deep-set, automatic, and extremely subtle assumption goes along with every experience you have. If you apply that realization repeatedly, then you can lift the filter you place on reality.</p>
<p>From moment to moment, experience your life directly, making a point not to assume separation. Un-assuming, or unknowing, or no-mind-about-it is pure practice. You offer the space for reality to appear as-is, without your own concepts and habitual structures piled on top of it.</p>
<p>So moment to moment mindfulness in an open-handed way is one way to attain subject + object = enlightenment. (It is also possible to use mindfulness to <em>strengthen</em> the illusion of separation, by repeatedly generating the thought "<em>I</em> am doing mindfulness"!) Also, object-related meditation can bring you closer to the equation. You and the object come closer and closer to each other. The object could be your breathing or counting, or it could be sounds that you hear, or any of countless other objects. Some objects are naturally more conducive to realization, and some objects may be better or worse for you in particular to work with, depending on your character. Moment by moment, round by round, you let go of the notion that <em>you</em> are doing <em>something</em>. You just do it. You let the method proceed, and you give yourself up to it. Relaxation helps, because it melts the physical armor that tends to keep you separate. Upright posture helps, because it encourages awakeness.</p>
<p>Eventually you reach a point — sooner, or later — where you and the object of meditation are together. It's no longer that <em>you</em> are watching the <em>breath</em>; there's just [<em>inhaling...exhaling</em>]. It's no longer that <em>you</em> are listening to a <em>sound</em>; there's just [<em>whoosh...whirrr...</em>]. In terms of the object you're working with in that moment, that's momentary enlightenment. That momentary enlightenment includes all objects and all times; but you don't realize that, because there is just the breathing or just the sound — you are <em>in</em> the experience, not reflecting on it.</p>
<p>When that unity becomes effortless, with no application of will, that is a quality of mind that is radically different from your day-to-day experience, and is even radically different from trying to do meditation practice. That is the first taste of the quality of real enlightenment.</p>
<p>And at some point, upon coming out of that effortless unity, you will see where you have been — you will glimpse the nature of mind and the world (or should I say "mind-and-the-world"), and that will be the first taste of enlightenment itself.</p>
<p>The important point is that enlightenment is not special. You are not getting anything other than what is really happening, what is really unfolding, what your mind and self and life actually is. So it is not grasping but rather ungrasping that reveals it.</p>
<p>When you ungrasp, what do you have? Right now you are reading these words. Your body is in a certain posture, in a certain place. We are communicating. Certain sounds and sensations are unfolding. Enlightenment is not different from this. Very simple.</p>
