  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I'm linking to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/4mlc86/notice_me_senpai/d3wkica">my recent post</a> with lots of information on various aspects of finding a teacher. Very simply, you can just start looking. Google 'Zen' and your city name. Ask in r/Meditation, or r/Buddhism, or r/Yoga. And so on. A couple of the links in my linked post give further suggestions.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need to have total certainty starting out. You're not going to commit to anything at first, you're just going to see. Like being introduced to a friend of a friend, or going to see a Broadway play — you're not going to marry the new acquaintance or set up residence in the theater; you're just having an encounter.</p>
<p>There are ways to confirm and be relatively safe with teachers, though you can't escape all risk. Just walking out your front door, there's going to be risk involved. Do your research and don't attach to words or action; that will keep you as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Note that I don't say you should approach with mistrust. That kind of attitude often creates more problems than it avoids. Let each new stage of commitment be based on reasonable knowledge. </p>
<p>Once you have heard a teaching or two, you might want to try a weekend workshop or 5-week meditation course. Once you've been around a teacher in various settings and have seen how she/he behaves — whether they're compassionate, and whether their actions match speech — then you might be ready to take another step. After some months of study and practice together, you might then have enough information to say "Well, I'm not sure if this is for me; I'm also going to look elsewhere."</p>
<p>Even then, when you're thinking of exploring other options, you could talk to your teacher about it. My root master was very open-handed about me visiting other teachers, as have all my masters been. (I think that if my own motivation weren't so clear I might have received different guidance in this area.) When I went visiting other masters, they would often just point me back to my original teacher. A good teacher shouldn't be possessive, although they may encourage you to stay in a stable training situation for a while. The teacher's aim is not to build a following, or make money, or be praised; their aim is to help you wake up.</p>
<p>The first and foremost thing you can do to avoid trouble is to be 'legit' yourself. You should be clear on what you're on about, what your life is actually for. Do <em>your</em> actions match your speech and you image of yourself? When you are sincere, it is more difficult for charlatans to fool you. When you don't grasp at special powers and mystical states, there is less bait you will bite at. If you know your own true motivation, you can connect very clearly and strongly to someone who <em>is all about that</em>; and it will be a joy to meet and be with that teacher.</p>
<p>Next, you can check lineage records. These are sometimes listed on a center's website; it will give the list of the teacher's teacher, and <em>their</em> teacher, and so on for many generations. This shows that the teacher has completed the course of study, has attained the fruit of the practice (which something beyond just finishing the course), and has been checked and approved by other awakened masters. If the website doesn't provide that information, you can ask for it. Be aware that titles and teaching degrees don't necessarily indicate awakening: there may be great benefit in studying with this person, but they haven't necessarily <em>attained</em> the point.</p>
<p>On this last issue, I do recommend studying even with advanced students who have been given authority to teach a part of the practice. It is extremely valuable to see how an intermediate-level practitioner conducts themselves, how they maintain their passion for truth, and how they deal with the same kind of problems that we all have. This is also very valuable, and shouldn't be passed over just because they haven't 'made the grade'. Just be aware of what part of practice they are qualified to speak to, and what they are not qualified to speak to.</p>
<p>You can also look at the conduct of advanced students and other teachers from the center you visit: what has the practice produced? Are they kind? Are they sharp and clear? Are they joyful, content? Just don't mistake inner focus for disdain or rudeness. Sometimes you'll encounter people who are working very deeply from moment to moment, so they may not engage in the trivial things we usually do to make ourselves feel comfortable. This doesn't necessarily mean they're not compassionate.</p>
<p>Finally, you can research the history of the center, and ask others about their experience. Just be aware that <em>every</em> place you go will have humans in it, with human failings and human blind spots. There is no perfect situation; and in some cases actually disappointment and tragedy reveal the depth of the practice. The issue isn't whether no mistake has ever been made by the teacher or community; the question is whether they deal with the mistake well, whether there's integrity to the process. Because we all need a way to return to the practice of waking up. If a mistake only signaled the end of practice for us, we would be doomed to always making mistakes and never waking up. That's not the aim.</p>
<p>Best wishes along the way!</p>
