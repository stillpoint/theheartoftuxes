  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I hear you. It's tough.</p>
<p>Some community centers and hospitals have free mental health programs or therapy groups. Some schools and universities have counselors or drop-in support groups. Some government mental health projects offer free or reduced-rate options.</p>
<p>I suppose one could try calling community info or a government mental health association to get leads.</p>
<p>Some of the useful therapies involve being with feelings in a simple, openhanded way. One practice that could be helpful is to simply settle down comfortably for a while and 'listen to' or feel what's happening in the body, and in particular the area around the heart, as well as the throat and belly. You can get into the habit of allowing feelings to be there and be what they are, to listen and allow (and accept) before taking any action.</p>
<p>This also gives you more information about what's going on in you and what your being really requires. Sometimes, for instance, we need to grieve and cry, or express anger in appropriate ways (like art, clear communication with relevant parties, setting boundaries with oneself or others), or really intentionally feel and welcome gratitude and joy.</p>
<p>This practice could also be part of a restorative yoga practice. You could take a comfortable position lying down, with bolsters, pillows, and blankets supporting or covering you. 'legs up the wall' is a good posture, or lying on the floor with lower legs on a sofa or bed, or lying flat with a booster or rolled towel or blanket under the knees. Be extremely nurturing and use any support that will make you more comfortable. Some people like a small roll under the neck; some like their arms supported. You may also want to put a bolster under your chest out a rolled towel down the length of your spine to open the chest and deepen the breath.</p>
<p>For many sensitive types, it is very comfortable to lie down under something a bit heavy, like a bolster or a couple of thick folded blankets. The feeling of weight helps settle the chaotic energy. It brings you in closer relationship to the earth and to your own foundation, your <em>place</em>.</p>
<p>These are good positions for being with yourself. Since one tends to drift off when lying down with closed eyes, you could also have an external support to keep you 'with the agenda' of listening to yourself. Some ambient music or natural sounds, or a guided meditation (even a recording of yourself occasionally encouraging to listen and stay with the feeling, breathe deeply, and relax), or a lit sick of incense, can help you avoid just falling asleep or getting distracted.</p>
<p>The aim is to feel, not to think about feelings. You can briefly label the qualities that you perceive -- sinking, full, empty, pent up, etc.; and you can even briefly note the kind of emotion present, if you want -- sadness, frustration, fear, love, etc. But you shouldn't make theories or think about what to do with the feelings. Just get used to feeling and letting feelings move through you without interference.</p>
<p>This is a good practice.</p>
<p>Also extremely useful in cases of addiction is bringing the body together, becoming fully physical in the whole body. Lightly brushing the entire surface of the body with the hands, if done as a regular practice, has been found to be very effective in treating oneself from addiction. You could also roll on a tennis ball or roller on the floor or use your hands to massage the body from head to feet -- whatever helps bring you into the body completely, without ignoring parts. This integrating activity is extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Just being physical and moving the whole body and breath together will also help integration. When you are in the body, you are in the moment; and your mind and its habits don't hold nearly the same amount of sway over you. If you consider how helpless you are in your dreams (well most people, unless they're masters) -- how little control you have over the way you relate to experience when you're disembodied -- this can show the incredible grounding influence of the body.</p>
<p>Our habitual patterns of relating to ourselves and to life become physical patterns of disconnection. Tension and armoring, or vacancy and flaccidity take residence in the body. We ignore or disown certain parts, and in general live up in our heads rather than in embodied reality. As in our dreams, we then fall prey to the movements of mind rather than being able to act from a stable place with full awareness of what's actually going on. Heart feels one thing, mind thinks another, and the alienated body and its action does something different still; it is all a jumble.</p>
<p>So getting out of the head and into the body, and piecing the body back together, living in the <em>whole</em> of it, is important. Free dance is a wonderful way of not only integrating the body, but also bringing body, heart, mind, and situation all together in unity. As well, being active by going for walks, runs, bike rides, playing frisbee or hackysack, doing yoga or Taiji, or almost any vigorous physical activity helps bring you more into your body, where you can have better control over your situation.</p>
<p>I'll also note that prostration practice is famously revered in meditative traditions as a spiritual practice in its own right, but also as an emergency method for settling the mind and bringing you into the body (and the moment) very quickly. I've seen its effectiveness among beginners who are troubled with distraction, depression, or excess energy, and also among advanced monks, teachers, and masters by way of embodying profound wisdom and devotion. It's difficult to persist if you haven't witnessed these benefits first-hand by being around other practitioners, but if you can manage it, making prostrations your go-to recourse whenever anxiety or the desire to act out arises could be transformative for you.</p>
<p>If you can't access therapy, you have to make more effort to help yourself. Then eventually your work and life situation will change and you may have better access.</p>
