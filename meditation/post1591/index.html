  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Third eye' means wisdom. It shouldn't be thought of as a physical location or extra organ.</p>
<p>Sometimes vague notions of energetic pathways get conflated into stuck concepts. We <em>loooooove</em> our concepts, don't we? We attach to them so strongly. It is because we like to have something to hold onto. But holding on is not wisdom. Letting go of holding, letting go of concepts is wisdom.</p>
<p>Holding on to experience, feeling, and energy is the same as holding on to concepts. We just want somewhere to hang our hat, something we can grasp and claim as our own. But that is not wisdom; that is not reality. Reality is broad, all-inclusive, all-embracing, ungraspable, unnameable, ever-changing.</p>
<p>Locally, energy is meant to flow, not to be held. When you 'have' energy, it means that energy is moving through you. There's a strong stream of it. But if you hold it, you stop it. So really, the way to 'have' energy is to allow movement. And the way to have wisdom is to allow unknowing.</p>
<p>The pattern of having energy stuck in the head is well-known in many meditative traditions; and each tradition has its own teachings and methods to resolve it. But sometimes we make problems where they need not be made: First, we may make our own ideas and assumptions rather than finding actual expert knowledge. Second, we may mix teachings and methods, playing at our own recipe rather than following one good instruction.</p>
<p>That is to say, while there are many good paths and teachings, it would benefit you to choose one and learn it well rather than picking scraps from here and there and trying to invent your own cure. The more serious the situation, the more critical this point becomes; but if what's happening for you is not a big deal, not a great imbalance, then general advice will suffice.</p>
<p>In general, feelings of tension, pulsing, buzzing, and so on indicate blockage. True spiritual energy is cool and clear; it doesn't produce these kinds of sensations. What you describe <em>sounds</em> like a combination of a bit of localized stuck energy, and a bit of overthinking. And of course, when the blockage is up in the head, checking it and thinking about it only contributes to the buildup. This is very common, very well known.</p>
<p>I'm not <em>diagnosing</em> this as the case for you, both because I am not qualified to diagnose and because I am not with you in person experiencing your qualities and posture and learning about your situation. If you require specific guidance on this — if it continues to be an issue — you should find a living teacher, someone expert and accomplished in meditation and energy. Take care not to follow suggestions from random people online just because they seem to speak with an air of authority (including me, okay?).</p>
<p>But if what's happening for you is what commonly happens, it really just means you need to settle down and relax. In almost all such cases it's that simple. And it's that simple in the vast majority of <em>other</em> issues in meditation as well. The great bulk of concerns that people come up with around meditation are solved by settling down, relaxing, and letting go of checking-thinking.</p>
<p>One of the very best, most effective ways to settle down energetically, mentally, emotionally, and physically is to do physical practice. Some vigorous exercise before you sit, and throughout your life, helps energy settle and flow naturally. You may not have to give it a second thought.</p>
<p>You will see: After you run a couple of miles, you will be very ready to sit. After you do 108 prostrations, or 300, or 500, you will be very clear and relaxed and ready to sit with very few thoughts coming up. Most rhythmic vigorous exercises will do wonders, such as swimming, rowing, and dancing. Also, physical work ("chop wood, carry water") is very good.</p>
<p>Prostration practice is highly regarded in many traditions because...</p>
<ul>
<li>it trains the body, mind, and energy together</li>
<li>it harmonizes and deepens the breath</li>
<li>it can include a very powerful devotional dimension</li>
<li>it can be performed along with visualizations (as per some traditional methods)</li>
<li>it is effective even during times of crisis and chaotic thinking, when sitting still would be difficult or impossible</li>
<li>it strongly and quickly brings the energy down from the head, into its proper seat in the body (the so-called 'lower dantien', located in the lower belly)</li>
<li>it is effective even without knowing or thinking about what is happening to the energy; just doing the simple movements is powerful and effective</li>
<li>it is a great exercise for most of the body</li>
<li>it tones the pelvic floor, guarding against some effects of aging</li>
<li>it aids digestive tract movement and helps relieve constipation (which also has an emotionally relieving aspect to it)</li>
</ul>
