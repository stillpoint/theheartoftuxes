  <h1>Does meditation require me to be sitting or standing in certain positions?</h1>

<p>It's not mandatory in the sense that you'd be a bad meditator if you didn't take certain positions; it's just that the mind and body affect each other profoundly. In fact, almost all people are unaware of much of the mind-body connection â€” they are not yet sensitive to the influences and responses that happen between mind and body, and do not yet have the presence that allows them to see the connection deeply.</p>
<p>Certain postures give support to the meditative mind, and certain postures burden or discourage it. For beginners, who have a difficult enough time bringing the mind to discipline, the postural support is very important. For advanced meditators, who have developed deep and continuous concentration that can be maintained though all kinds of postures, the postural support is nevertheless both (A) helpful in their ventures to ever more sublime and tenuous territory and (B) an embodied expression of their mature meditation.</p>
<p>An upright, noble, relaxed posture promotes an upright, noble, relaxed mind. Self-supporting posture trains one in relying on one's own resources. On the other hand, slouching, unbalanced, and artificially supported postures promote sleepiness, dullness, instability, and dependency. The "catch-22" of it is that meditators attached to dreamy comfort usually don't perceive their own lack of awareness; they confuse the drifting and vague dreamy quality for bliss and concentration.</p>
<p>One reason for cross-legged posture is its inherent stability. Advanced meditators can sit in this posture for an hour or even many hours without having to concern themselves with re-adjusting or toppling over. Some practice paths also count on cross-legged posture to help circulate energy a certain way (i.e., the right and left sides of the body form a balanced circuit, and the active and passive aspects of the mind are brought into harmony). This level of tweaking is not necessary unless you are in a tradition that focuses on these issues.</p>
<p>You can do a lot to help yourself become more flexible and stable in cross-legged posture, over time. If some day you want to do long sittings it may be worth it to make the effort. Using the proper firm cushioning and the right height of support, and positioning your body the right way on the cushions can help relieve tension and open the breathing. Doing yoga or specific stretch and strength exercises aimed at meditation posture can be a big help in the long run.</p>
<p>But it is not (usually) mandatory to sit cross-legged, or to sit on a mat at all. Sitting upright on the front edge of a sturdy chair is a very valid method. Standing up is also very valid.</p>
<p>Lying down in bed is useful for relaxation practices (like <em>savasana</em> in yoga), but the posture is not a wakeful one, and for proper meditation it's only a last-resort option for times when you may be sick or injured. If you lie down, or even if you close your eyes or slouch, you will have difficulty maintaining clear wakefulness. You also run the risk of increasing your attachment to sleep and laziness.</p>
<p>It all depends on what you want to achieve. If your aim is just to get a good night's sleep, then by all means try the lying down postures. If your aim is to gain a freedom beyond your suffering habits, you need to follow a proper form and take a noble, awake posture with both body and mind.</p>
<p>First-hand instruction will be best for you, because then the teacher can see where the problem lies. Without seeing your posture, I have to speak only in general terms. It is likely that your abdomen is either collapsed or under tension. That means the diaphragm and ribcage are not free to expand and contract fully and naturally.</p>
<p>Collapse often happens when the knees are raised off the mat. You should have enough firm support under your butt (and enough flexibility) for your knees to be in firm contact with the mat. This creates a very stable triangle between your sit bones and your knees, within which triangle the belly can be free to relax and breathe deeply.</p>
<p>Tension can also happen with the backward collapse of the lower back and crushing of the abdomen, or equally with a too-forward thrust of the lower back and ramrod rigidity of the spine.</p>
<p>Collapse corresponds with lax mind and lazy effort. Pushing and tension correspond with grasping mind and forced effort. If the mind is trying to grasp or avoid something, the body posture will reflect it, and vice versa. What we're seeking is a posture so stable and strong on the bottom that the upper can float easily. The spine is then naturally erect rather than rigidly held, breath and energies can flow to their appropriate places, and the mind can be pacified.</p>
<p>You say that you have a much easier time meditating lying down; but "easier" is not the aim. The aim is to put the right effort toward waking up. This means we learn how to have an easy mind or attitude within outer difficulty. How else will freedom and compassion be trained? If you only opt for "easy", how will you ever move beyond your own petty likes and dislikes?</p>
<p>The most helpful postures will have a surrendered relationship with gravity <em>in the upright</em> direction. Your skeleton will stack up on itself in an integral way, so that muscle tension is not required to keep you upright. When concentration is developed, the concentration itself will keep the body upright. It may sound like a strange thing to say, but you can soon have the experience that correct meditation <em>puts</em> your body into that noble, upright posture.</p>
<p>Can you sit comfortably with knees firmly on the mat if you have support under your sit bones? You should be on the front edge of any cushion you use, and your pelvis should be fairly upright. This creates a sort of bowl the abdomen can relax into. The belly can hang out in front. On some bodies, a gentle inward curve appears in the lower back; on other bodies, the lower back is fairly straight.</p>
<p>In terms of breathing, it should be relaxed rather than controlled. If you are a habitually shallow breather, some gentle but slightly more extended belly breathing can be practiced for a few minutes to "wake up" the breath before getting into the actual meditation practice. Focus completely on the method and don't judge or try to control the way the breathing goes.</p>
<p>If you are simply not comfortable on a mat, sit on the edge of a chair so the thighs are fairly parallel with the floor. The pelvis is still upright rather than tilting forward or back. You can rock forward and back, and side to side, to better feel the easy center axis where your body is self-supporting. If you're specifically interested in standing meditations, check out <em>zhan zhuang</em> stance practice in Qigong and Bagua.</p>
