  <h1>I used to feel euphoric after meditation, now I get a headache.</h1>

<p>Lying down is appropriate for relaxation practices and some very specific meditations, but in general it is bad for most meditation. Lying down is the posture of falling asleep; meditation is about waking up. Lying down is the posture of withdrawing from waking life; meditation is about cultivating even-mindedness and attention <em>with</em> and <em>within</em> life.</p>
<p>So the aim of practice must be clear. If you only want to relax and fall asleep, no problem; but maybe don't call that 'meditation'. What you feel to be 'one with the universe' is most likely the indulgent comfort of drifting off into dreamland. While it may be pleasant and may temporarily relieve stress, it can't help you actually deal with life -- you won't be practicing freedom from stress while actually facing things.</p>
<p>You say you want to get back to the pleasant feelings you had before. Yes, everyone wants that! :) But that is not real life. So wanting and trying to get only your favorite situation is already a problem; it already creates tension, because you can't be with life as it is, you only practice trying to get your favorite. This builds greed, not mental stability.</p>
<p>Real life is sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant, and sometimes neutral. Sometimes you get what you want, but never completely, and never without eventual losing it. Sometimes you get what you don't want, and you can't avoid it completely, and it has its own unfolding that doesn't happen according to your schedule. And sometimes -- a lot of the time -- a whole bunch of stuff happens that you neither want to get nor want to avoid, so you tend to ignore it.</p>
<p>This is real life: you can't hold what you want, can't avoid what you don't want, and need to deal with things you habitually ignore. So how can you be okay with that? How can you have peace with real life rather than trying to find a 'perfect situation' that is impossible to attain? </p>
<p>Meditation means waking up to life as it is. True meditation means your mind doesn't move: your <em>mind</em>, not any outer object or person or situation, is the source of your peace and happiness. So you need to train your mind to be peaceful in all kinds of situations, including when you don't get what you want and when you get what you <em>don't</em> want. This is the training in peace and freedom through meditation.</p>
<p>Grasping at something that's not there creates a tension. That tension manifests energetically and physically. It can be reflected in your patterns of breathing, which are very closely tied to the way you use your mind. So if you have a grasping attitude, your energy will not flow properly, your breath will not move naturally, and your body will not align with integrity. This could very well be the source of some headaches.</p>
<p>Often we may look at our previous situations with nostalgia; but we see them through our limited thinking, which is frozen in concepts, and can never hold the breadth of reality. We really do see through a filter; we make up a story about the situation. And if we then hold onto that story, it is as if we are willingly trading in real life for an old, dead dream. We are associating with a fixed, unmoving concept, locked in the past, rather than living our real, vibrant, constantly unfolding life. This practice is the opposite of life! It is stuck, dead. It has no vigor, because it doesn't move. It grows in fear, because it clings to something old and avoids the new. This is not a fulfilling attitude. And yet, because we attach to good feeling, we may choose this over real life.</p>
<p>When you were truly content, you weren't at that time <em>trying to get some previous state</em>. You were in the flow of your life. So it is like a Zen Master said: "you should have it as if you didn't have it." Don't hold onto anything, but trust your home in the constantly unfolding present moment. You original home, your original mind, has always been there, and has always been the source of contentment. To the degree that you entrust yourself to it, you can be happy and at peace with any situation. To the degree that you ignore, mistrust, or cover it, you lose contact with that source of contentment. In correct meditation, you wake up, pay attention, and let the mind be still enough to settle into its original home. Anything can happen outside: any activity, any feeling, any thinking. That is all outside. Inside, your mind doesn't move. Everything is okay, as-is. That is correct meditation.</p>
<p>There could also be other issues causing headaches. Posture, for example. If your neck is positioned in a way that brings tension, the tension creeps up the neck and around the skull, creating pain.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear why you get the headaches; but please consider the aim of your practice. If you only want to temporarily shut down and have a nice feeling, then you can listen to music or go to sleep. If you want to develop peace and freedom of movement in your life, then you should learn correct meditation, sit up, open your eyes, and meditate with complete openness to whatever the moment brings, whether it's your favorite or not. Soon, that openness will be your favorite, and you will be free to enter any situation with confidence.</p>
