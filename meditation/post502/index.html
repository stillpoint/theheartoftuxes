  <h1>Any serious meditators who sit on chair and not on the floor?</h1>

<p>The primary reason for sitting on the floor is to establish a very firm foundation so that the upper body can release the muscular effort to stay upright, and the tension that ensues in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can help yourself when sitting on the floor (i.e., on a mat on the floor), but if it's not working out for you at all, you might achieve a more stable foundation and subsequent release while sitting on a chair.</p>
<p>The meditation posture should be <strong><em>upright</em></strong> and <strong><em>comfortable</em></strong>. This reflects and supports the mind that is noble and at peace â€” upright body and mind, comfortable body and mind. Many meditators are unable to find complete comfort with the body at first, or even over many years of practice; it's a negotiation between the body and the mind: we do our best to achieve a posture that is both wakeful and at rest, but with the awareness that practice ultimately does not depend on the outside form. The comfort of the mind eventually brings the body around, so sometimes you need to endure reasonable discomfort in order to train the mind to be okay with life-as-it-is. Once the mind develops a more stable, peaceful nature itself, the tension in the body tends to relax and even physical/energetic bliss is possible (though it's a side-effect, not the aim of meditation).</p>
<p><strong>While the traditional posture is not indispensable (outside of rules set down by a teacher or group), it does offer many benefits, both physical and esoteric.</strong> When a meditator reaches a certain level of alertness and sensitivity, he/she tends to be drawn to postures that offer greater stability and energetic flow. These stages of alertness and sensitivity are not usually reached by people who simply dabble in meditation or use it as an occasional de-stress technique; and this is one reason why you will find such differing opinions on the significance of posture: those who haven't experienced its significance will not vouch for it. There are thousands of years of systematic investigation and verification behind the traditional meditation postures; the pivotal question is "what do you hope to achieve?"</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes people avoid sitting in a chair out of pride.</strong> This is already wrong meditation, even if the sitting posture is perfect in form. Find the balance between laxity and forcing. Once you find a "good enough" posture, put your focus on the method of meditation.</p>
<p>In terms of sitting on the mat, let's make sure you are actually attempting the proper posture. How do you cross/fold your legs? It shouldn't be a crossed-ankle "tailor" pose with the knees not touching the mat. This is painful on the shins, and leads to a curved and stressed back.</p>
<p>For people without a lot of flexibility, the <strong>"Burmese"</strong> posture, with one leg tucked in front of the other, is often the easiest to start with. If possible without stressing the knees, you can pull one ankle above the other, with the lower leg in contact with the mat, and both knees firmly rooted.</p>
<p>If you find your knees lift off the mat when you sit, it shows that you need more flexibility or higher support under your seat (or both). The cushions under the seat should be quite firm, not soft or bouncy. Foam is usually no good. Kapok, quilted cotton, buckwheat husks, and sometimes folded blankets tend to produce the best foundation for the sit bones. <strong>Cushions can be added under the seat</strong> until the knees come into firm contact with the mat, but after a certain height a couple of problems arise: first, the whole posture becomes less stable; second, the hips are pressed open, which can tilt the pelvis too far forward for the upper body to be able to achieve a solid, relaxed posture.</p>
<p>Another thing you can try is to place a <strong>firm cushion or rolled or folded towel under the knee(s)</strong> that's not in contact with the mat. This helps stabilize the posture without the problem of tilting the pelvis too much. During each sitting, you can spend the last few minutes without the knee support, to gradually stretch the muscles and tendons until they allow you to achieve the posture without support.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>seiza</em></strong> posture, kneeling on the heels, is used in some traditions. Some people with less flexibility are still able to use seiza. It is very stable in the front-and-back direction, but a bit less stable in the side-to-side direction. Opening the knees a little while in seiza can provide more stability, but this is strictly prohibited in many temples and cultures (it is considered a rude act, associated with exposing the genitals). Sometimes the ankles become painful from the stretching and weight-bearing in seiza, in which case there are a couple of remedies: First, you can straddle a cushion (like riding a horse). This relieve pressure on the knees and ankles, but decreases the stability of the posture, and like cross-legged postures there's a limit to how high you can go with the cushion. Second, you can let the feet hang off the end of the mat so the ankles aren't stretched as much. This is another banned move in many dojos and temples â€” one is expected to stay completely on the mat.</p>
<p><strong>Standing</strong> is another viable posture for meditation, although it can be difficult to avoid a lot of tension building up over long periods. The hands would generally be held in <em>gassho</em>/prayer posture, with palms flat together in front of the heart, and at 90Âº to the forearms. Some standing meditations, like <em>zhan zhuang</em> practice in <em>qigong</em> use different body and hand postures as well as their own energy-based methods.</p>
<p>Gentle <strong>movement</strong>, aerobic exercise in combination with <em>correct</em> stretching, and/or yoga and similar training can help increase the circulation and flexibility of the hips so that you can eventually sit comfortably on the floor. Traditional Thai massage is aimed at helping one to sit in meditation for extended periods. The Korean practice of Sun Mu Do is very specifically aimed at monastic meditation situations.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose to sit on a chair</strong> â€” which is a completely viable option â€” it should ideally be a solid chair without arms, and of a height that keeps your thighs close to parallel with the floor when your feet are flat on the floor. If the knees are too high or too low, not only will it pull the pelvis into a difficult position, the legs will tend to flop after a while and you will find yourself having to use muscular effort to keep them in place.</p>
<p>Sit on the front edge of the chair. Don't use the back for support. Sitting on the front edge also takes pressure off of the back of the thighs, which otherwise leads to legs falling asleep and/or pain. Some people find it useful to use a thin meditation cushion on the chair; others use the chair alone. The hands can be kept in meditation posture in the lap, as they would be when sitting on a mat.</p>
<p>At home I tend to use the meditation mat, but during long retreats where much of the day is spent in meditation posture I often use a chair for at least half the time.</p>
<p><strong>Although mind is primary, posture has a tremendous influence</strong>, especially until advanced levels of concentration have been attained. Using supports or lying down are not recommended unless there is no other option (broken back, very ill, etc.). Practices that use the lying down posture are very different from wakeful meditation; they have a different purpose and function. If you're looking to train in meditation, the key words are <strong><em>wakeful</em></strong> and <strong><em>relaxed</em></strong>.</p>
