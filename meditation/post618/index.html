  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Be wary of the beginner's mistake that 'easy' means 'good'. Because what's easiest to you is to follow your same old patterns of like and dislike, grasping and avoidance; which means you never have the chance to grow beyond petty indulgence. If you are working at transformation, you will necessarily feel the impact of it — the difference between the 'favorite' that your immature self has been clinging to, and the new life that lies beyond.</p>
<p>Rather than always requiring the outside situation to be cushy, meditation training develops <em>your own</em> ease: you learn to relax and find balance in all situations, in all relationships, at all times.</p>
<p>If your aim is only relaxation leading to sleep, lying down is no problem. If however your aim, as is appropriate for meditation, is to <em>wake up</em> to reality, a wakeful posture is necessary.</p>
<p>This holds true until you can maintain bright, continuous, wakeful meditation regardless of the position you take. This, however, is extremely rare even among very experienced meditators. You might be a meditation master before lying down has no dulling impact on your mind.</p>
<p>Often enough, meditators will figure that posture makes little difference; but that conclusion doesn't come from their knowledge or awareness, it comes from their dullness and <em>lack</em> of awareness: they are not even at a level of clarity where they can begin to see that posture makes a difference, much less perceive all of its subtle ramifications. Thus it is best for these students to follow the guidance of those who have traveled the path ahead of them, who have verified the effects with comprehensive and penetrating insight, who have benefited from the collective experience of many other meditators and masters over centuries, and who themselves have achieved the full fruition of the practice.</p>
<p>As a beginner, the main thing is to take a posture that supports both relaxation and wakefulness.</p>
<p>Some benefits of proper posture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One can maintain stillness for a longer duration, allowing the meditation to deepen rather than be constantly interrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The background noise of tension and restlessness settles down, and the attention becomes more precise and subtle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dullness, sleepiness, and self-defeating attitude are counteracted. (If you ever experience a brooding despondency about your life you can see for yourself that lying down encourages laziness and resignation, and that just sitting up straight can turn the whole mood and train of thought around.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The armoring of the bodymind that maintains the illusion of separateness softens, and one's boundless nature can come forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deeper, more natural breath is facilitated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health is improved through the relaxation of internal organs and greater circulation (as when one is slouching or prone for long periods the internal organs become cramped).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance of body and mind arise mutually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spirit, or power of presence, is brightened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The human relationship with gravity and the communication between sky-nature (sublime, spacious, absolute) and earth-nature (grounded, stable, present with the world) is made more evident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subtle energetics are assisted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The energetic and symbolic meaning of the posture sinks into your deep consciousness and teaches you: you gradually realize and embody your noble, wakeful, balanced being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From my previous post:</p>
<hr />
<p>This question has been dealt with numerous times on r/meditation and r/buddhism. You can do a search.</p>
<p>Here's my previous post in its entirety, along with a link to discussion of some of the energetic and physical implications of the posture:</p>
<p>&gt;I wrote in detail about the lotus posture <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/36v6eq/legs_arrangement_in_a_full_lotus_position/crhkeic">in a recent post.
</a></p>
<p>&gt;At the level most beginners are working at, any generally upright posture will do — any posture that is both awake and relaxed. This includes sitting on the floor or mat, using firm cushion or folded blanket, sitting on a chair, kneeling on the floor or mat, using a kneeling bench or kneeling chair, standing in regular upright posture, standing in special stance (as popular in internal martial arts), or walking. </p>
<p>&gt;The main point for most people is just to support presence; i.e., to help the meditator stay alert without distraction.</p>
<p>&gt;At more subtle or profound levels of meditation, and especially in the yogic paths (which are not <em>necessary</em> for awakening, but can result in many beneficial attainments), posture becomes much more important and sometimes crucial. In these meditative/yogic paths, the flow of breath and energy are dealt with in great detail and subtlety. The body posture facilitates it.</p>
<p>&gt;Even in less exalted practices, the same posture contributes to flow, which definitely supports the mind. If there is flow, there can be concentration and unity. If there is no flow, separation and disturbance persist.</p>
<p>&gt;As one's awareness becomes more refined, one can see how every posture, movement, activity, and intake influence consciousness. How you use your body in and out of meditation, how you eat and sleep and exercise, how you relate to others, how you use emotion, what you allow to come into your mind — all of these have effects. It's just that some people are sensitive to the effects while others don't yet notice them.</p>
<p>&gt;The lotus posture has many benefits; but it is only ideal within a certain context, like having the physical capacity to do it, first of all, and being in a course of training that can make use of it. It can't be said to be ideal for everyone, because everyone has a different context, a different situation. For some people, sitting in a chair is ideal... until their context changes.</p>
<p>&gt;At some point you may get the meditation 'sickness': you may experience down to your bones that meditation and the spiritual life are absolutely necessary for your happiness and the happiness of the world. You will be consumed by the need for truth, and regular rat-race life will no longer have a good flavor for you. At that point your motivation will be to practice as much as possible. Then you may want to have a posture that will allow you to sit very still and very stable, breathing freely, all parts of your body in communication with each other, providing an unfailing physical basis for long periods of deep meditation. At that point, you may start training to achieve the lotus posture. But many masters don't use or require it. Mind is primary.</p>
