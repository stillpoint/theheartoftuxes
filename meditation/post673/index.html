  <h1>How do you maintain mindfulness throughout the day?</h1>

<p>When you are ready, <strong>making the commitment to complete moment to moment practice</strong> is easier than dividing your life and always trying to start again. Once you are clear on the motivation and aim -- what you are doing with your mind throughout the day, and why -- it is much easier than treating spiritual practice as one thing and daily life as another.</p>
<p>So the first, most pivotal step is to <strong>clarify motivation</strong>. Why do practice; why be mindful? This is to be clarified not only in theoretical understanding, but in the heart. It must be a sincere motivation. This is not something that can be contrived; and the process of classification will proceed at its own pace. For many of us it's a lifelong process, until stability sets in.</p>
<p>There are few, if any, practices better for clarifying motivation than <strong>mindfulness of death, and death meditation</strong>. If you truly desire greater focus and more clear motivation, you'd do well to make death meditation a daily practice.</p>
<p><strong>True practice moves from the inside out.</strong> You transform yourself from the core -- everything depends on your own mind. So <strong>external supports are secondary</strong>.</p>
<p>Although they are secondary, external supports are important for those of us who don't have stable practice. <strong>We use outer influences to tame the mind. These include...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>surrender to a good (not necessarily perfect) teacher</strong></li>
<li><strong>regular access to correct teachings</strong></li>
<li><strong>practice with a group of sincere seekers</strong></li>
<li><strong>clean, orderly living and practice space</strong></li>
<li><strong>healthy and regulated sleep and diet</strong></li>
<li><strong>lifestyle changes that support peace and awareness</strong></li>
<li><strong>association with wise, sincere, stable people</strong></li>
<li><strong>a clean body, and noble dress and posture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Really, you can start almost anywhere to gather more of the causes for awakening.</p>
<p>Diet and relationship are two especially influential areas for modern-day people. One enlightened Yoga master says that <strong>proper diet is half of the practice</strong>; that is, half of your effort can be taken care of with the right food, eating schedule, and style of eating.</p>
<p>Until your practice is stable, try also to <strong>associate with people who are stronger than you in insight and commitment</strong>. There no substitute for living examples of what's possible; both your conception and your inspiration can be completely transformed by association with a strong 'practice person'.</p>
<p>As to mindfulness methods, you should <strong>be very clear on the method</strong> you are working with. There are many good variations. What they have in common is that they bring you simply into the present moment. That's the main thing. But if there's doubt or vagueness about what to do with your mind, the mind will always have an 'out', a pathway of diversion and unawareness.</p>
<p>In general, <strong>the mind should be openly aware</strong> from moment to moment, without grasping at any object. If you need <strong>more of an anchor</strong> than just general open awareness, you can choose an object to keep in the background (or sometimes foreground) of awareness.</p>
<p>Depending on your sitting meditation practice, you may be able to bring that object into your everyday activity. <strong>Breath</strong>, of course, is a popular anchor. <strong>Mantra</strong> work is also very common in mindfulness. The object you keep as an anchor throughout the day is not held as closely and exclusively as it may be in meditation: it is just there constantly in the background as you go about your business, keeping you present. Resist the tendency to check <em>how present</em> you are, because this is a counterproductive departure from presence.</p>
<p><strong>The body is our primary tool for grounding.</strong> Bring more physical in general will help you be present in reality. <strong>Athletics, dance, and body-based spiritual practices</strong> are all good in this regard. Daily <strong>prostration practice</strong> helps tremendously with grounding: presence becomes natural and easy, rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Since the body is so effective as a grounding tool, I recommend <strong>awareness of the physical foundation</strong> as a mindfulness method, ahead of breath or mantra unless there is some personal proclivity for those. Keep some <strong>awareness of your feet</strong> on the floor as you go about your day. It is easy to integrate this into your activity; you do things the same way, just with a background awareness of the feet. When sitting, feel your feet and butt. When lying down, feel your body's contact with the bed or sofa.</p>
<p>As other commenters have mentioned, you can also use <strong>visual, auditory, and other sensory cues</strong> to bring you back. Keep an image of wakefulness within your line of sight at the tasks you perform most often -- maybe when you look up from your desk, in the kitchen or bathroom, and in the entry/exit to your home or room. Set a timer to ring every half hour, quarter hour, or ten minutes, as you wish. You can also wear objects that remind you visually or through touch, like a wrist or necklace mala. If you can do without shoes and socks, the bare feet will help you remember your physical foundation.</p>
<p>It is also very important to know that meditation mindfulness are only part the wheel of practice. <strong>Character training and ethical conduct</strong> are just important, for if you perform harmful actions no amount of meditation will put your mind at peace. Your sincerity has to be whole and real.</p>
<p><strong>Mind is primary.</strong> Don't get blinded by the quest for external support. If you keep at it, you will succeed, even if the practice is imperfect. That's how Buddha did it. Good luck.</p>
