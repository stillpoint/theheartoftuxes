  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>So basically we should be trying to break out of the habit and make every single thing, whether it be action or thought, conscious and know why we are doing it and where we hope it to lead??</em></p>
<p>'Conscious' doesn't mean you think about it and create analyses and plans.</p>
<p>It means you are awake for the moment. Undistracted.</p>
<p>Many newcomers to meditation and spiritual practice don't understand how to integrate the practice with regular life, because they don't understand what lies outside of their (<em>our</em>) usual, habitual way of relating to life through thinking. It is difficult for someone who hasn't had <em>before-thinking</em> pointed out to them, to know that thinking isn't the only option (much less the <em>best</em> one).</p>
<p>Reading books and blogs, talking about it in person and discussing it in online forums, and turning it over in your mind -- all of these have the same basis: thought. They all encourage the notion that life is somehow solved or understood through thinking. Even if I share with you a point of practice, you will habitually engage with it by thinking and making ideas. But none of this is the conscious practice I'm talking about -- at least, not by itself it isn't.</p>
<p>The very nature of thought is unreal. First of all; thought is limited, whereas reality is unlimited. For a thought to be useful, for it to do what it's meant to do, it has to limit and define. It puts something in a conceptual box, distinguishes it from everything else. So the very nature of thought is limited. But the world, our experience, our life spreads out boundlessly.</p>
<p>Next; thought separates one thing from another; but in reality, everything is interconnected and interdependent. One thing flows into another; one thing is created and conditioned by everything else.</p>
<p>And finally; thought is frozen; it conveys one meaning at a time; but life is constantly moving, changing, flowing, interweaving. In reality, nothing ever stops.</p>
<p>So the attempt to understand reality through the thinking is completely misguided. It's just that for most people it's the only way of engaging they know, the only way they can imagine. The common person is so habituated to thinking about everything, they have no conception of any other possibility.</p>
<p>This constant, habitual activity the common person engages in does <em>not</em> align with reality! The more you try to understand with your thinking, the further you go from reality! For most people, every minute of every day involves some false construction, some creation of a false world of separate, fixed objects. And the most significant of these creations is the idea of oneself as a separately-existing, fixed thing. The idea of 'I' is a big, deeply held illusion.</p>
<p>For instance, when asked "who are you", most people would react as if this were a ridiculous question. "Well, this is me right here," and they'd point to their body. But this body is constantly changing, and is made up of the environment. When you think of what is really happening, that person is pointing to a fleeting, sloshing river of food, water, air, and light energy co-mingling as ever-moving flesh, sinew, bone, blood, phlegm, urine, feces, pus, mucus, oil, and so on. That person is pointing to all this and saying "this is me, obviously." But we don't think of ourselves in that way. We think even our bodies are fixed in time and separate from the world.</p>
<p><strong>So, all of this points to the fact that thought is not the basis of spiritual practice, because by its very nature it conjures something unreal. In spiritual practice, we</strong> <strong><em>use</em></strong> <strong>thought, but our practice is not</strong> <strong><em>based</em></strong> <strong>on thought.</strong></p>
<p>Practice is based on <em>before-thought</em> -- the original pure mind before thinking appears. This is the mind we return to. This is the mind we train in trusting. It is clear like a mirror, only reflecting the plain truth.</p>
<p>If we trust our true before-thinking mirror mind, <em>then</em> we can use thought correctly, and appropriate conception will appear. We will know that thought is just thought -- just a symbolic approximation -- and so we will be able to use it.</p>
<p>If you want to move toward enlightenment, you need to have the before-thinking mind pointed out to you, and you need to learn how to apply it in the countless situations you encounter in daily life. So you need a teacher and a practice training situation.</p>
<p>On your own you can take some first steps, but for significant progress you need a teacher and training situation. One's own blind spots and preferences are very deeply entrenched, and a self-invented course of training will naturally include them. The teacher and practice setting function beyond one's own limitations, consistently providing the view that -- left to one's own devices -- one would otherwise only stumble upon.</p>
<p>So if you want to understand moment-to-moment conscious activity, you have to <em>do</em> it, not think about it. A good practice group and authentic teacher will help you get true practice experience, digest it, and make it your own life.</p>
