  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>These are extremely common questions among beginners. Don't worry, it comes clear. Just keep your feet moving.</p>
<p>The teaching develops in your subconscious <em>and</em> conscious mind. But you don't clutch at it or try to make something of it. Your old, narrow, habitual view (which is the reason for practice in the first place) doesn't take hold of the teaching and hammer it into its own shape. You let it be, like water running down a duck's back, or a milkweed seed floating in the breeze.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>On the other hand, how can I choose? How do I know that the teaching I practice is not manipulative or cultish as you say Sekida's writings are?</em></p>
<p>Due diligence. You do your research. You try things out in a balanced way, neither going all-in based merely on charismatic or emotional basis, nor retreating just because something is new and unusual. You try, step by step. You keep your eyes open and see how the other students and especially the experienced students and teachers in the school carry themselves. You get your own experience that validates the teaching enough to try the next step or disproves it enough for you to ask into it: are you hearing it right; are you applying it well; did you miss some necessary condition; ...or is it simply not what it says it is?</p>
<p>&gt; <em>at some point I will be using my conscious scrutinization to decide what works for me.</em></p>
<p>Yes, in balance. Appropriate caution, without the kind of skepticism or arrogance that clouds the exchange.</p>
<p>You are not expected to abandon your reason, or even your intuition. You are expected to set aside your <em>opinion</em> enough to take in something new, and to call up enough aspiration and adventurous spirit to take a next practical step.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Also, how far has this lifestyle gone for you?</em></p>
<p>What are you asking? What 'lifestyle' do you imagine? I offer advice based on my personal experience. If I didn't have faith based on actual experience, I wouldn't offer it. It's smarmy to just spread speculation to others; that's not my interest. There's something very precious here, more precious than the mere continuation of life; I would be happy if you were to connect to it, but that's completely up to you.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I have no interest in absolving myself of all indulgences and pleasures and love etc.</em></p>
<p>This is one of the most common misconceptions, that basic human qualities have to be quashed. Where do people get the idea that living with integrity means being some sort of Dharma robot? It is only in their imaginations that the story unfolds. If you ever meet an enlightened being, or even some folks well on that path, you will see for yourself that they are among the most vibrant, unique, engaged, multidimensional, <em>human</em> people you are ever likely to meet.</p>
<p>(Perhaps rivaled by the misconceptions that love and pleasure mean indulgence, and that indulgence contributes to happiness.)</p>
<p>&gt; <em>...how has it changed you? What were you like before?</em></p>
<p>I don't like to talk about myself, even in person much less online. But I can say that Zen practice saved my life, and that it is one of the most valuable and worthwhile treasures ever to appear in my experience and in the world. My practice has not been limited to Zen (I've trained with masters in all major branches of Buddhism, as well as in other religions, shamanic practices, and non-traditional meditative paths) but I do respect and revere it deeply.</p>
<p>If anything, with practice I have become more real, more fully human. My emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual sides all have strong voices now, where before certain sides were suppressed. My purpose is clear, and even when I fall off the path I soon find my way back. Even when old patterns resurface I still know what constitutes right relationship.</p>
<p>Basically, regardless of my low attainment and vast faults, wherever I find myself I can move in the right direction. This is all because of my teachers and the fact that I have applied their teachings, even if imperfectly.</p>
<p>I hope and think the people in my life would say that I show up for others better and more completely than before.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>And where can I find this teacher, or guru?</em></p>
<p>Well, you start. You try. You look.</p>
<p>Do you think you are so deserving that it will come to you automatically? You have to take the next useful step... and then the next one... and on and on....</p>
<p>There are many posts about how and where to find a teacher, including several in my posting history. It is also a common question answered in other forums, blogs, videos, and articles. In this information age I'm sure you have several good ideas of where to start; but the first thing is to actually start!</p>
