  <h1>Do I have to leave my love behind?</h1>

<p>Not enlightened here, but I can answer.</p>
<p>Why am I here? I am responding to your questions.</p>
<p>You start off with not just one, but a few false assumptions. Any doubt you have is made up of your own thinking.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is love? (Attachment is not love.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes you think there is a person out there looking for you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes one person special above others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are you looking for one person in particular?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is this person you are looking for? (Do you identify an actual person you know, or is it in your imagination?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you suppose you need from someone else that you don't have yourself?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Originally you are not separate from anything or anyone. Your original mind is complete. There is nothing that you lack, and there is nothing that can make you more. So originally you don't have desire for objects, yearning for other people, and thinking and action based on attachment. But these desires and attachments have taken hold and now you think that you lack something, and that you will not be okay until you get it. This is the big lie behind popular notions of love. It is not love at all, but desire, attachment, and a false sense of inadequacy. This kind of "love" is based on self-delusion.</p>
<p>Enlightenment means returning to your original completion, returning to what you already are. This is accomplished by letting go of the illusory world you make with your thinking. So you don't let go of love; you let go of <em>false</em> love, ideas and feelings based on self-delusion.</p>
<p>False love is all about <em>I, my, me</em>. It's always concerned about its own personal drama, getting <em>my</em> favorite situation, feeling what <em>I</em> want to feel. True love is completely openhanded, only offering to others. True love has no conditions; it doesn't make bargains to hold or get something for itself.</p>
<p>Love radiates. It requires nothing, but fills everything up. Love doesn't have limits; it doesn't say "I am for this person, but not for that person". It only offers benefit for all. It is like rain that falls on the whole landscape. Rain doesn't say "There's a pretty flower; I'm going to give everything to this pretty flower, and the rest of the world can fuck off." Rain falls on everything equally without holding back.</p>
<p>Love is like the sun radiating its warmth and light. The sun doesn't say "You don't deserve my light, but that being over there does, so I'm going to shut it off for you and shine for that one over there." The sun just radiates. Love is like this. It does not attach to separate beings and objects, it only does what it does. Love is like this, and your original mind is like this; because your original mind is already love, already radiating.</p>
<p>But let's look into something perhaps more to the point. Why would you ask these questions? What is the motivation — what are you concerned about? No doubt you are afraid that you will be missing something if you follow that path of enlightenment. You are afraid of missing love, yes? That is your own emptiness speaking, based on false views.</p>
<p>So listen: <strong>You cannot get love. You can only be love.</strong></p>
<p>No one in the history of the world has gotten love from someone else that they didn't already have. You can be triggered, nourished, broken open; but what emerges is what you already have. Some fortunate meetings can catalyze a change in you, but your original mind never changes.</p>
<p>The major question is whether another person can <em>save</em> you, whether another person has the power to wake you up and transport you completely beyond any suffering… forever. This question illustrates the difference in relationships. Relationships based on attachment lead to suffering. (In fact, they <em>are</em> suffering; they are want and lack and disturbance and unclarity.) Relationships based on awakening lead to awakening. An enlightened being has attained their original mind, so they already are completely full of love; and they radiate love to everyone, not just one or a select few.</p>
<p>If you really love someone, you will do everything in your power to help them understand their original mind, awaken, and overcome their cycles of suffering. That means you will do everything in your power to help them be free of attachment, including attachment to you. Whether that entails being with someone or not with them depends on the situation.</p>
<p>On final question:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you know that the person for you is not the person facing you in the moment? Perhaps the person you neglect or dislike is the one who can teach you to drop your illusion and attain your original mind. Maybe the most difficult person is "the person for you".</li>
</ol>
