  <h1>Trying to start meditation, but I quickly become overwhelmed with emotions [help]</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I just feel this surge and I cry, with virtually no thoughts attached to it (I usually have negative self-thoughts), it is all emotion.</em></p>
<p>That's wonderful! That's correct meditation. No thoughts, only allowing what is, to be.</p>
<p>Crying or not crying doesn't matter. It's all fine.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Needless to say, this makes it difficult to continue.</em></p>
<p>This is the part that doesn't follow. When crying appears, only cry. That is already "continuing"; that is already meditation. Only don't make ideas about it.</p>
<p>It is your <em>idea</em> that says this is overwhelming or wrong, or that you can't continue. If you drop your idea, then your emotions can find their own balance. For whatever reason, you have had a lot of sadness or other crying energy arise (it's not necessarily sadness; sometimes poignancy, sometimes joy, etc.). That's fine. If — for whatever reason — it continues in meditation, just be faithful to the meditation. Maybe you will become the Buddha of crying, saving all beings through your crying.</p>
<p>You have already had very good insight. You know that you usually keep your mind distracted. So there is very likely a backlog, a traffic-jam of material that would otherwise have already flowed through; and when you allow some space to appear, that backlog starts to flow. Great. No need to judge it as special in any way, good or bad.</p>
<p>Meditation means keeping a mind that doesn't move. It is just a space, like an open room or a blank page or a clear mirror. Whatever appears, appears. The objects and movements that appear within the space don't matter; you only keep providing space. That means that you express your true nature, which is stable and compassionate: anything can arise, no problem; you just don't try to make it happen, hold on to it, or push it away.</p>
<p>If you are not thinking, then surging and crying are no problem. Presumably your continued openhandedness will help it all balance out. That is also your true nature: equanimity. But if the emotions actually disturb you, and you can't let go of thinking that they are somehow wrong, there are indeed other methods you can try.</p>
<p><strong>Movement meditations</strong> can engage the body to help ground you. People's energy and perspective is usually based in one of three centers: when it's up in the head, there is a lot of thinking and imagining; when it's in the heart, there is a lot of feeling and surging; and when it's in the belly, there is more calm and balance. Movement meditation can help the energy come down from your heart where it is overactive and into the center of the body, where it has more rootedness. <strong>Walking meditation</strong>, <strong>Taiji</strong>, and <strong>prostrations</strong> could all work well for you. I usually recommend free dance, but in your case it's possible that it could stimulate the emotions more than you like. (But if you're up for that, it could also be a great way of processing.)</p>
<p>I am interested to know what you think. Usually depression means a retreat from feeling, so crying can actually become rare. Since you say you don't have the usual negative thoughts while you're doing meditation and crying, do you have the sense that it is a bad or dangerous road to allow the crying, or do you think it's fine?</p>
<p>My sense is that it is important for you to have as many grounding influences as possible. Crying or not crying is not so much the issue as being able to maintain an anchor in simple presence, and not be swept away by whatever thoughts or emotions may appear. <strong>Feeling the feet on the floor</strong> when you stand or walk, and feeling the body's contact with its support when you sit or lie down will help you be more anchored. <strong>Being very meticulous about the chosen method</strong> of meditation will help. <strong>Frequent contact with an experienced teacher</strong> or spiritual guide — one who actually has attained the fruits of his or her practice — will help.</p>
<p>Just sitting and noticing everything may be too open for you currently. You may do better with one very clear object of meditation. You don't need to force away all other objects, but you return to the one object as an anchor. I'd also like to hear whether focusing on sensations helps you (by making you more aware of your inner situation) or hinders you (by overstimulating the emotions). You may like to try <strong>mantra, together with the physical act of counting beads</strong> on a mala/rosary. The mantra will provide a clear object to return to, and the beads will provide a physical action and sensation to ground you.</p>
