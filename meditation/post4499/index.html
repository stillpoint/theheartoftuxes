  <h1>['deleted by user']</h1>

<p>The basic problem addressed by meditation is our attachment to thinking. Because we attach strongly to thinking, it controls us; <em>we</em> don't control <em>it</em>.</p>
<p>This situation is very, very uncomfortable for us. Our thinking makes problems for us in our lives, and it makes problems in our relationship to ourselves. Down to our bones we feel anxiety because of our attachment.</p>
<p>For example, it is very difficult for most people just to be plain and silent, without doing something in particular to fill in the silence. This highlights our basic anxiety about reality: we can't handle just being real for a moment.</p>
<p>This is the problem meditation addresses.</p>
<p>In life, we find many ways to 'take away the mind'. Since it's uncomfortable for us to intimately experience our thinking, we seek external activities to temporarily occupy it. And of course, many things occupy our thinking without us even seeking them out. Entertainment like TV and movies certainly is designed to take our mind away. Sports, hobbies, music, study... anything that requires focus or that has some stimulating or spectacular quality can be used to take the mind away. But when that external support is gone — when it's 3 AM and you've been watching TV for six hours and can't stand it any more; or when you're too tired to do more sports — then the mind comes back, and you have to face it without that external support.</p>
<p>If you've been used to using external crutches to take your mind away, you will have little power to settle down on your own. Your mind will race here and there, and not only will it be uncomfortable for you, it will also create all kinds of bad causes in your life because of the things your mind habitually chases or avoids.</p>
<p>Therefore it makes sense to develop skill in <em>taking your own mind away</em>, not relying on something external. This doesn't mean you try to destroy thinking. It means you practice letting go of attachment to thinking. Your letting go then becomes stronger and stronger, and your thinking no longer controls you. Thus not only do you not suffer the direct painful effects of your thinking mind, you also do not make negative causes that bring future suffering.</p>
<p>Almost anything <em>can</em> be a meditation; but if we're honest about it, we have to admit that the indulgent aspect takes over, and the discipline is very easily abandoned. Then the value of meditation — the very aspect that is liberating — is lost.</p>
<p>Many, many people fool themselves about their activity. They call it 'meditative' or they call it 'spiritual'. For instance, we see lots of pseudo-spiritual gatherings for storytelling or dancing. In themselves, these can be very positive activities; but many people fool themselves that they constitute proper meditation, when they do not. The participants are just doing what they feel like doing, and with wishful thinking they label it 'spiritual'. Because they fool themselves in this way, people never truly transform, never develop the ability to liberate themselves from their habits. Their like-and-dislike habit is actually increased, because they mistake feeling good for attainment. This kind of mentality is rampant, and when questioned is aggressively defended (which shows how much ego is involved).</p>
<p>If you think that an activity you like can be used for meditation, then it would be wise to test it. Check it out like a litmus test checks out a solution for acidity or alkalinity. Try actual strict, formal meditation, with an absolutely clear method and a timer and accountability to a group, and see how well you do. If you can breeze through it then maybe your chosen activity has been helping. But likely you will find that you are still controlled by your like and dislike, that you haven't developed any degree of equanimity that allows you to engage in various activities with equal awareness, and that the mind still wanders here and there when not distracted by an external activity.</p>
<p>Many activities and arts have been subsumed into spiritual paths. For instance, many martial arts are taught as ways of liberations; brush calligraphy, flower arranging, cooking, tea ceremony... a lot of Eastern life activities have become 'ways' (<em>Do</em>, or <em>Tao</em>). This depends on the context of training. A very clear, and often very strict and demanding, training is applied under the guidance of a master; there is a great demand for consistent awareness built into the training, and there is a high level of accountability under the watchful eye of the master. Together with the constant renewal of the student's own aspiration (i.e., remembering that you are doing this activity to go beyond yourself and wake up, out of compassion for all beings), this provides a context that can make regular activities into meditation.</p>
<p>In smaller ways, with proper form and motivation you can be meditative with anything you do. But be honest with yourself about how you are actually using your mind; and take a litmus test every once in a while so you never end up fooling yourself for long.</p>
