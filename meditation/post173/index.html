  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Your post is a good example of several misconceptions newcomers have about meditation. I'm pointing these out here not to come down on you but to help you and many others who may have these misconceptions.</p>
<p><strong>First, the aim generally isn't to stop thoughts.</strong> If you set that you as your goal, you're going to have a hard time and get discouraged.</p>
<p>Your original nature is still and pure; and that is always true -- there's always an aspect of your being that just perceives openly, like a mirror or like the space in a room that receives activity without being affected.</p>
<p>But the activity of your thinking mind is a natural process, and will tend to continue until you reach higher states of concentration (if that is your meditative path -- it doesn't have to be). Really, the aim in meditation is to <em>return</em> to presence. That is, when thought takes you away, you have the ability to return. Eventually, through consistent practice, thought will take you away less and less.</p>
<p>It's not that thought necessarily disappears. You need thought, after all, to be able to function and create and relate. Without thought your life will be like a vegetable. But correct meditation will help you become less <em>distracted</em> by thought, less moved or disturbed by the things that arise in your thinking mind. <strong>The practice of returning to presence, which for you means returning to a clear method of meditation, is the key.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The next misconception is that high-level achievements can be attained with low-level effort.</strong> People read about the benefits of meditation and develop the fantasy that the magic is in the method rather than in their consistent application of it. There's no magic other than using your mind properly, more of the time.</p>
<p>For instance, if you consider how you use your mind most of the day, you may not even be aware of what goes on for you. Once you bring awareness to a few minutes of daily activity, you will see the kinds of trivial, reactive, attached, jumping-around patterns we habitually engage in, that have been termed 'monkey-mind' for their similarity to monkeys that are quickly distracted by the next new thing, jumping from tree to tree.</p>
<p>So consider that this is how you use your mind for, say, 15 or so hours every day, and that at times there will be far more intense attachment generated -- lustful thoughts, frustration and anger, envy and jealousy, dull or hyper-excited states while taking in entertainment, craving and grasping at sensual pleasures, and so on -- and you can realize that a few minutes of attempting simplicity and calmness are not going to offset all of that other activity.</p>
<p>So two points here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, you can't expect that all of that activity is just going to go away, so you should be realistic and compassionate with yourself regarding expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, if you want better result, you need both proper, clear, method and consistent application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt; Cause and effect are clear.</p>
<p>Your result (the ongoing state of your mind, in and out of meditation) is directly related to the ways you use your mind and how long and how intensely you use your mind in those ways.</p>
<p>If you want to see better effect, your cause has to be clear and consistent. You need a <strong>clear, effective, proven method</strong>, not just one made up by yourself or invented by someone experimenting or posing as an expert. You need to <strong>learn the method well</strong>. You need to <strong>apply it meticulously</strong>, rather than changing styles or tweaking or leaving out important aspects because you don't yet understand their reason or you aren't yet comfortable with them. And you need to <strong>repeat the practice regularly</strong>, not based on the whim of the moment.</p>
<p>At first you can try a few times just to enjoy, and you shouldn't push yourself or you will become resentful and resistant. But by the same token you have to understand cause and effect, and that eventually, gradually, little by little, you will need to increase the duration and consistency of sittings in order to see ongoing benefit.</p>
<p><strong>The third misconception is that literal straightness of the back is necessary.</strong> 'Make your back straight' is a catchphrase used by teachers who at first came from the East and who didn't have fluency in English, and later by students attaching to the words without understanding their purpose.</p>
<p>The human spine is not meant to be straight; it has natural curves in it. Our misuse of our minds and bodies leads to unnatural degradation of posture that makes meditation more difficult by cramping the internal organs, shutting down the breath, blocking circulation of blood and energy, and creating painful tensions that distract from the task. Since most of us tend to slouch in the classic 'couch potato' posture, and relate that to relaxation, we are instructed to straighten up. This shouldn't mean you actually try to make your back ramrod straight (though some cultures like the Japanese military/samurai culture have overlapped with meditative styles and do call for exceptional, almost rigid straightness).</p>
<p>There are <strong>two important aspects of posture</strong> for meditators from beginner to intermediate: the posture should support and embody <strong><em>alertness</em></strong> and <strong><em>relaxation</em></strong>. Both aspects are equally important. The posture shouldn't be so rigid as to lose relaxation, and it shouldn't be so slumped as to counteract alertness. As long as you respect those two aspects, almost any sitting-up position will be effective. You can sit in a chair, if that's more comfortable.</p>
<p>If your body is tight and tense, creating pain, then you'll probably need external support, both by way of <strong>mats and cushions</strong>, and by way of <strong>guidance and physical practice</strong> to start bringing more flow and flexibility to your bodymind.</p>
<p><strong>The final misconception I'd like to address is the notion that meditation is an isolated practice</strong> -- that you are supposed to achieve results only by sitting on a mat. In truth, everything you do in your life will be reflected in meditation. Meditation is like a mirror that shows you yourself, your life. <strong>The ways you use your body, speech, and action will all appear in some form in your meditation.</strong> If you have flow in your body throughout the day, you will be more physically comfortable when it comes time to sit. If you use only noble, meaningful speech and otherwise keep silent throughout the day, your internal dialog will be more calm and clear. If you have integrity in the way you think of and relate with others and with your environment, your mind and heart will naturally be at ease.</p>
<p>So what you see during meditation is just a small part of the <em>effect</em> of causes created earlier in your day or earlier in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Physical practice</strong> can be very helpful in calming the mind; and in fact, if calmness and stress relief are your major aims you may want to take up a movement meditation practice rather than, or in addition to, a sitting practice. Bowing practice, walking meditation, running, Yoga, Taiji, and free dance are all excellent practices that greatly enhance sitting meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Taking care of your mind</strong> during the day, refraining from engaging in petty and agitating involvements, and acting with love and generosity will cause a huge shift in the meditative experience as well.</p>
