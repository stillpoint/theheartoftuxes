  <h1>Three observations from my morning meditation</h1>

<p>Even among traditional Japanese lines there are some exceptional formulas, some serviceable ones, and some stinkers (no pun intended). The very profound scents tend to be very expensive, so it is sometimes a trade-off between quality and price. For an incense used daily or multiple times daily for meditation sessions, the cost of the higher quality formulas may be prohibitive.</p>
<p>An incense used daily in many meditation centers around the world is Nippon Kodo's Mainichiko ("Daily Incense") Viva Sandalwood. It is sometimes referred to as Viva Pine, and is one of the more commonly available names. Boxes of 10 rolls are not expensive. The scent is neither profound nor overbearing; but once you get used to it you may have the experience of "being at home" whenever you visit a center that uses the fragrance.</p>
<p>Nippon Kodo's Mainichiko Sandalwood (not branded under the Viva name) is similar. The Mainichiko Kyara Deluxe is based on Aloeswood. It is also used daily in some centers, but its use is nowhere near as widespread. The fragrance is more particularly slanted to a woody/powdery scent, and may be an acquired taste.</p>
<p>Nippon Kodo does make some exclusive fragrances as well, including Jinko Juzan, which is mostly Aloeswood. If you are partial to that scent, this is the one to buy. This and other high-level scents range from $50 to several hundred dollars per box.</p>
<p>Another excellent, affordable, daily incense that is quite a bit more profound than either of the previous is Reiryo Koh (or Reiryoko), the incense used at Eiheiji temple in Japan.</p>
<p>Shoyeido offers many scents, some a bit perfumey or oppressive (and anyway more suited to entertaining than meditating), and some very masterful and profound. Enmei (Circle) and Fresh Breeze (Seifu) are sister fragrances, but quite different from each other. Both have a deep stillness to them, but Enmei has more of a rigorous edge to it and Seifu is almost swooningly lyrical (although not in the least bit juvenile). For a special treat, either of these do well; and if you can afford it you may like them for meditation.</p>
<p>Shoyeido's Friend Of Pine (Matsunotomo) is like a high quality version of the previously mentioned Viva Sandalwood. It has some similarities to Enmei, but is more affordable for frequent use (and lacks some of the complexity and high-price ingredients of the latter).</p>
<p>Others specifically marketed for meditation are Morning Zen and Sitting Zen. The problem with these is that they are made in thick, long sticks, and emit too much fragrance for a small room. To counter this one can break or chop the sticks into small pieces that only burn a few minutes at the beginning of sittings, but then you end up wasting more of the stick since you will have more unburned ends. Morning Zen is the less oppressive of the two.</p>
<p>Another well-respected long-running Japanese company is Bayeido. I don't have much experience with their line.</p>
<p>Chinese incenses tend to be based on the "five spices", perhaps deriving from an approach of balancing various qualities (balancing the five elements). Some of the higher quality sticks are good for meditation, but many are simply either too perfumey or too spicy to do well anywhere but in a huge, densely populated temple.</p>
<p>Korean Incenses tend to be even spicier, weighing heavily toward wood, resin, and spice in their ingredients. The feeling is of dryness and vigor, in keeping with the Korean style of practice. Some of these need a large room, unless you go in for high-impact experiences. The best of the commonly available daily-use Korean scents is Jing Kwan, which is indeed quite dry and spicy. More exclusive scents include Bo-rim (a sandalwood based fragrance), Soek-Hyang, and Ja-Keum. </p>
<p>Another, slightly milder, daily-use Korean incense is named True Heaven or Heaven's Truth (the Chinese characters are Tian Zhen Xiang), but there is no English writing on the box. These are available through some Korean temples.</p>
<p>Almost all Indian incenses are much too thick and oppressive. Even the least obnoxious among them, the ubiquitous Nag Champa, produces a very thick and sweet smoke. Whereas the East Asian processes tend to combine the actual wood, resin, and spice raw materials in a pressed stick, the South Asian process tends to use a splinter of wood covered in punky material that is then dipped into a perfume mixture. The overwhelming, dizzying quality of Indian incense tends to reflect the nature of both the culture and some popular spiritual approaches: dizzying absorption in bliss, as opposed to detached settling into focus. This, of course, is a gross generalization; but you'll know what I'm talking about if you've experienced the difference yourself.</p>
<p>Western incenses are almost terrible across the board, and only the raw materials are viable — dried sage, sweetgrass, and/or cedar, for example. But realize that different fragrances (and different sacraments) fit into different traditions for a reason. The energies evoked may or may not be most helpful for your particular practice. It is not the case that "anything goes"; and the more sensitive you become in your meditation, the more you will see how every last part of your environment can influence you.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, traditional European resins like frankincense and myrrh and benzoin are best left for special occasions. The intense fragrance and smoke produced by burning the raw resin crystals is too stimulating and distracting for meditation. (Interestingly, some of these are used as remedies for delerium or other loss-of-consciousness conditions, which speaks to their stimulating quality.)</p>
<p>Stay away from small independent companies, and brands that try to distill particular fragrances into a stick ("juniper", "raspberry") or that have very conceptual names ("calmness", "spirit", "temple of peace"). These are almost always stab-in-the-dark efforts, and almost never successful. Also for the most part avoid cone incense, coil incense, incense formed around a wooden stick or splinter, incense based on essential oils, and most handmade incense. <em>Don't even think</em> of using a spray or chemical stick or something you plug into an outlet — run in the other direction!</p>
<p>One broad exception to the handmade incense recommendation is Tibetan incense. Many of these are handmade. Like the Japanese offerings, they are the raw ingredients pressed together into sticks, but in much thicker and more rustic form. Tibetan incense tends to have more herbal fragrance, slightly less resinous, and a more smoky quality (though not necessarily more smoke per weight of incense). Most Tibetan sticks are good for meditation. They have a similar in-your-face quality to the Indian scents, but tempered by a greater calmness and profundity — an interesting reflection of Tibet's position between the Southern and Eastern traditions, as well as its own isolation and thus its uniqueness. Tibetan incense tends to have a more active, healing quality in contrast to the deep stillness of Japanese incense, again reflective of the difference in culture and spiritual approach (Vajrayana vs Zen, perhaps).</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you venture into the world of incense, do yourself a favor and eventually sample Shoyeido's King's Fragrance (Ohjyako) and Nippon Kodo's Mainichi Byakudan. The Mainichi Byakudan is almost completely sandalwood crystals — very powerful; and the King's Fragrance is similar to Chinese spice-based fragrances, but in a very complex, layered, mind-blowing combination. Although both have the ability to connect you to something very deep in yourself, neither is quite suited to meditation, simply due to the intensity of the experience.</p>
