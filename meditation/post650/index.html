  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><strong>It is more difficult because you attach to those thoughts more strongly. The thoughts themselves have no greater reality.</strong></p>
<p>At some level, you know this. You just permit yourself the drama of attaching to certain thoughts. If you want to keep trying meditation, then <strong>become very momentary</strong> with your focus, and <strong>stick to the method</strong>. (Do you know why you are doing meditation; do you have a clear, proven method; and have you learned it well?)</p>
<p>Then when the frustrating thought arises, rely on your meditation method. Realize that <strong>you yourself are doing the holding-on</strong>; there is nothing inherently more real or important about any of the thoughts that appear. It is completely up to you whether you hold and follow them or whether you return to the method.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>let's take note of what we're talking about when we say that certain thoughts are 'a problem' or that they're 'difficult to let pass'</strong>. This usually means that when you let go of a thought and return to the method of meditation, another similar thought soon appears. You then <em>check</em> what's going on â€” and this is the mistake! Instead of continuing with the meditative process, you step outside of the process to see how you're doing; you compare your current situation to past situations; you judge your current situation to be somehow wrong or problematic; and you decide that you're beset by an intractable problem. All this happens through your own thinking; it is not the world making a problem for you.</p>
<p>So when you let go and that next thought appears, it is just momentary. Your job is to be momentary: just this one moment, just this one letting-go and returning. This thought is completely new and unique. It is not the past thought. It is not proof that something is haunting you. Only <em>you</em> make that judgment, that idea about what's happening.</p>
<p>In other words, your checking and comparing and judging <em>makes</em> the sense of something happening over a span of time, which you label a problem. But if you don't check, if you are just momentary, then each time any thought appears you can let it go and return to the method. (This, by the way, is why it is very important to have complete faith in the method. So you need a proven, effective method to start with; and you need to know it well â€” how to do it, and why it's done the way it's done.)</p>
<p>In the moment, it is completely up to you what you hold and what you let go of. Taking on this rigorous mindset, don't settle for a lax approach. <strong>Don't settle for the notion that some thoughts are just meant to hang on to you.</strong> <em>You</em> must let this one go, just now. Every time: just now, just now, just now.</p>
<p>Then <strong>limit your activity</strong> to what you can control. If you try to overturn your entire psychology, the result of years and lifetimes of conditioning, it is impossible. If you try to wrestle a problem that has been coming on for weeks or months or years, it is impossible. But you can handle a moment. It is even less than a second, it is just now. Just now, you can let go of any good, bad, or neutral thought that appears, and return to your method.</p>
<p>Next, there is a common notion that there must be absolute silence in the mind, and that success is tied to the absence of thoughts. That's not true. Instead of <em>checking</em> your situation and thinking "damn, here it is... <em>again</em>", your task is to focus on the method. Let the method do the work for you. <strong>Your business is not to check how your thinking mind is doing</strong>, okay? If no thought, no problem. If thought, also no problem.</p>
<p>There's also something to be said for <strong>thankfulness that these difficult thoughts keep appearing</strong> â€” so you can keep practicing letting them go, and you can get better at it, more centered, more grounded, less affected by them; and so you can then become a more functional and compassionate being. When frustration appears in your life, you will be able to let it go very quickly; and when frustration appears in someone else (or <em>as</em> someone else) you will be able to be with them, centered, peaceful, aware. You will not have to avoid any of the things that currently frustrate you. So you might be very thankful for these opportunities to practice letting go, returning, and compassionate awareness.</p>
<p>As I very frequently do in response to these kinds of questions, I'll also add a recommendation for <strong>physical practice</strong>. When the mind is racing or when there are other mental or emotional blocks to even starting to sit and meditate, physical practice is extremely helpful. It is also immensely underrated as a meditative practice in itself.</p>
<p>Rhythmic, full-body-and-breath movement helps bring the mind down quickly. It centers you without having to face the thinking mind head-on. It gets the breath and blood flowing, which oxygenates the brain. It gets the energy flowing, which smooths emotions and settles the mind. It is healthy, and generally makes your mood lighter and your attention more clear. Traditionally, prostration practice goes hand-in-hand with sitting. It is an excellent practice if you want to continue but find it very difficult to sit. You could also try walking meditation, swimming, running, rowing, Taiji, Yoga, or one of the many 'conscious dance' practices.</p>
