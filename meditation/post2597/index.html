  <h1>Anyone here believe or practice the Radha Soami meditation?</h1>

<p>It's heartwarming to hear about your grandmother. Thank you for sharing that. Whether you follow in her footsteps closely or share the path by walking your own way, it seems that your connection can benefit the both of you.</p>
<p>It's also a relief to hear that obeisance to the teacher is not a rigid requirement. Most traditions will rightly expect reverence and respect for the master, and many will offer the master as a representative of your inner greatness, to which you surrender.</p>
<p>When I hear that you have started meditating, I think "now <em>that</em> is interesting!" Trying to find a perfect situation is not interesting. Planning on doing something is not interesting. But <em>doing</em> something — taking action — is very interesting!</p>
<p>I am familiar with <em>Om Namashi Vai</em>. It is the favorite mantra of one of my teachers, who shared it in the form <em>Om Nama Shivaya</em>. I agree; it is another layer to keep the mind from straying, and the main thing is just to practice with it, not that it has any magical power beyond your own effort.</p>
<p>In my opinion, opening the 3rd eye and other energy work should proceed under the close supervision of a master. There's too much opportunity for attachment to events (sensations, states, visions, etc.) as energies are released; and that is not the point of meditation. In fact, my inclination is not to <em>try</em> to make anything particular happen. Not being enlightened, the beginning meditator is not in a position to say how the mind and energy should function.</p>
<p>Manipulating the mind and energy amounts to an ego-based activity, like fiddling with a remote control, or like trying to manage someone else's feelings and reactions. But I do understand that opening the third eye and other energy practices are prominent in spiritual practices from your culture, so I wouldn't try to talk you out of them. I would just suggest that you put the remote control in the hands of someone who can see clearly and who can reliably rise above ego to guide the practice. At the moment, that is not you.</p>
<p>For instance, your comparison of the experience to a mushroom trip shows that you are assessing the experience. That is attachment to object, which is attachment to illusion. If you take on practice, your mind should either be unmovingly seated in God (or Consciousness or Self, whatever name you use) or focused on finding It. Attaching to the events that occur, the special or not-special feelings and realizations that appear, is just distracting yourself from the task at hand. All appearances are empty. That is why I would be concerned about you trying to force some opening or state of mind: you would likely get wrapped up in events rather than focusing on the surrender, the stillness behind it all.</p>
<p>In Radha Soami, it seems that the method for accessing the stillness behind it all is mantra, which leads you to the inner sound stream. So your mantra practice should be very good preparation if you choose to go that way, as well as a very good practice in its own right.</p>
<p>This is very important: When you surrender in any practice, letting go of the grip on the world of objects, all energies are allowed to go where they naturally and rightly go, so <em>all</em> of your eyes and ears will function correctly. Completely unifying with your mantra will open your chakras; you don't need to concern yourself about that.</p>
<p>There was a master of Chinese spiritual practices, Nan Huai-Chin, who was acknowledged as having reached high levels of mastery in Taoist, Confucian, Buddhist, and Zen practices. He wrote about the difficulty of cultivation. In particular, Taoism has a very complex and involved regimen of practices where you build energy, purify it, cultivate it, circulate it, arrange it in correct relationship, use it to penetrate blockages and open centers, and connect it to the Universe. So Master Nan would write at length on these practices and the difficulty of attaining even one of these steps on the path. Finally, after many hundreds of pages of explanation, when he had finished describing all of the methods and how they follow from one another, he said essentially this:</p>
<p><em>But if you keep no-mind, that is the same; the energy will be arranged.</em></p>
<p>One line among many thousands! But that is important. You can try to make it happen, that is one way if you find a good method, teacher, and venue. But if you completely connect with your meditation with openhandedness, that is the same. Not trying to steer the results, you let your <em>original</em> completion appear.</p>
<p>Good luck, and thank you for your practice!</p>
