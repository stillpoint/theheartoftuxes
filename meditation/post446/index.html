  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Dissasociate' is different from being free of attachment to the body. It's like throwing out all your meaningful photos and keepsakes, but still being very attached to them. Just getting rid of the possessions doesn't change your attachment; so then you no longer have them, but you regret it and pine for them, and miss the heartful connections they promoted.</p>
<p>So dissasociation means you are still attached to the body and still attached to an idea of selfhood, but you lose the sense that you have a body. It is not free and grounded; it is not a relationship of ease with reality. It is a lost and groundless relationship.</p>
<p>If you're looking to be <em>free</em> of the body, you should become fully embodied. When you life fully in the body, with all its messages — all the emotions and sensations that flow through it — then you can know experientially that <em>you are not the body</em>. It is not a mindset you try to force upon yourself; it is reality, and it appears by itself if you just allow it.</p>
<p>The suffering mind is mistaken about escape. People try to hold onto their favorite situations and run away from or destroy uncomfortable situations. It makes a life of grasping and running, fear and aggression.</p>
<p>But the reality is that all situations change, and we can never hold onto a situation for long, and we can never fully avoid discomfort. This is the truth of existence. So our freedom and ease come from <em>making peace with reality</em> — learning to be <em>with</em> things as they are, rather than flailing about, grasping and running away, grasping and running away.</p>
<p>Trying to avoid reality makes the mind very narrow. The more you try to control your emotion, the more pent-up it becomes. The more you try to escape change and unpredictability, the less capable you are of facing it, and the weaker your character becomes. The more you try to get only your favorite, the more selfish and brittle your heart becomes.</p>
<p>So correct meditation means turning around in the other direction. Instead of going along with the world of people who are grasping and running away, meditation turns around to face reality and come to terms with it, establish peace and ease with it.</p>
<p>So body-based practice is very important and very helpful.</p>
<p>Really, if you want to disassociate from the body, just keep on cruising Reddit or playing video games. Soon the body will become pale and weak, and you will lose touch with its wisdom. No problem: if that's what you want, just continue the trend of society. Drugs, porn and sexual addiction, alcohol, cocooning (isolating oneself from society), disgusting fast-food, bad sleep — you only have to go along with the trend in order to disassociate. No special meditation necessary.</p>
<p>But to be <em>free</em> of attachment to the body, a strong sense of self and a strong connection to the body is necessary. When you perceive the body's messages clearly, you can experience directly the difference between the messages and the witness of the messages — the difference between what was previously thought of as the 'body', which is really an ever-changing collection of sense perceptions, and the <em>you</em> who perceives them.</p>
<p>Escape is already suffering. It already assumes there is something wrong; and that assumption colors all experience. And any good path can be tainted by this wrong attitude. Even wonderful healing meditations can be poisoned with an attached mindset that tries to control experience.</p>
<p>So proper guidance is necessary. Good, consistent, frequent teaching from a person of integrity is necessary. Because even if you receive wonderful teaching once or twice, or ten times, your avoiding mind-habit will soon sabotage what you've learned. So you need teaching that is at least as consistent as your habit, so that it can get deep into you and begin to overturn the ingrained misconceptions and gut reactions.</p>
<p>You also need to befriend yourself. Without the body, how will you be able to progress in understanding? How will you be able to take action for your happiness, not to mention the happiness of others? The body is the basis of awakening.</p>
<p>Hatred of self and hatred of the body comes from psychological wounding. Usually it means that one or the other parent has been absent or abusive in some way, physically, mentally, or emotionally. The relationship with the mother is particularly influential on our sense of love for our physical selves. If that relationship has been lacking, one may spend a lifetime repairing the damage, re-learning how to love oneself, how to appreciate and take care of the body. The mother is the first teacher of this relationship.</p>
<p>The father is the first teacher of our relationship with the heart. What a surprise this is for many of us! In many societies we assume that men are supposed to be hard and aloof; but actually it is the man who is supposed to have the penetrating courage and steadfast faithfulness to live from the heart — to feel deeply, to be conscious of one's reactions, and to express oneself with sincerity and wholehearted compassion. If the relationship with the father has been lacking or dysfunctional, one may seek power from outside sources, whether special mystical energies or vision, or money or fame, when really it is the inner power of the heart that is missing.</p>
<p>So if you want freedom from the body, you must have integrity: the body must become a fit and stable home for the mind and spirit. With a fit and stable home, the mind and spirit can roam freely. Without a fit and stable home, the mind and spirit wander like ghosts, grasping but never being able to hold.</p>
<p>Practices that liberate the spirit through the body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prostrations, with or without accompanying devotional practice</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
<li>Taiji</li>
<li>Body-based meditation like Vipassana</li>
<li>Body-based psychotherapy</li>
</ul>
