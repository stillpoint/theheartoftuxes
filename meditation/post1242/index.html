  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Discipline' has a very particular meaning in spiritual practice. It is not what people usually think of; it is not forcing yourself to do something. In my experience, almost no-one can change their life that way, by forcing themselves. That is not real discipline.</p>
<p>Discipline is completely momentary. You may think of it as something that will sweep away a problem across a certain span of time; but it is not that. It means you return to the moment, with openhanded clarity. You don't manipulate, you just <em>see</em>.</p>
<p>And when you <em>see</em>, then naturally you know what to do. When you see that you are covering up a feeling of emptiness with distraction, you will know that truth lies in the direction of feeling that emptiness. When you see in the moment that this video game or web surfing is not helping your life, you will know to let it go.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the moment you will take a cookie. Sometimes in the moment you will not take a cookie, you will leave it. You don't necessarily know ahead of time. That is discipline.</p>
<p>If you only hold an idea that you must never do something, that is holding an idea and unnaturally forcing it upon yourself. Your mind will soon rebel, demanding to be free, and will act out with indulgence.</p>
<p>So regarding meditation: It can be part of your overall discipline, just as sleeping well, eating reasonably, washing regularly, and treating people with integrity all can come from momentary openhanded clarity. All of these things are just taking care of the moment, <em>which is the only place where true life is found</em>.</p>
<p>If you are not in the moment, you are not in life and life is not in you. There is no life besides the moment. All the rest is just thought. So this shows you the place where you can actually wield your power, the only place where you can actually make a difference: not across time, but only now.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of other points here.</p>
<p>First; taking on a meditation practice can be very emowering, and can support your self-esteem. This goes a long way toward transforming addictions. Or, conversely, you'll probably notice that there's a vicious cycle that happens, where you distract yourself more when you feel hopeless and down on yourself, and then you feel even more hopeless and down on yourself when you indulge. So actively doing things that build self-esteem can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Meditation, generous acts, simple productive work (almost any kind), self-care like fitness and cleaning your body and living space, and taking on new (even daunting) challenges can all help in this regard.</p>
<p>Next, it is much easier to work toward something than merely try <em>not</em> to do something. You may heroically avoid distraction for a while, but if there's a vacuum in your life because of it, with nothing else coming in to engage your heart and mind, it will be very difficult to endure.</p>
<p>That's another reason why it's good to have somewhere to go, something to do, some big or small project to work on. If you choose a goal to work toward, define it. Make it concrete rather than vague, so you can identify exactly when you've achieved it and perhaps even track your progress toward it.</p>
<p>One trick is to start very small and proceed very gradually. If you start meditation, only do a couple of minutes at a time, maybe five minutes or so. But do it every day, without fail. This will quickly build self-esteem and faith. Because it is a small and easily attainable goal, just a couple of minutes, you will be able to achieve it very consistently. And each time you achieve it you will get the reward of knowing that you can turn your mind to a task — you have some control over your life. <em>Emphasize</em> the reward! Enjoy having done a meditation session. Bask in the calmness or focus. Actively congratulate yourself, and even know that enlightening beings everywhere are looking on with praise and congratulations. Steep in that reward. That becomes the much more pleasurable and beneficial prize than distraction, and will begin to supplant your old habit.</p>
<p>Even a small achievement can be celebrated and enjoyed, and so it will be transformative. But on the other hand if you set too big a goal, or pursue it inconsistently, the effect will likely be disappointment and self-blame. Especially in the first several months we want to avoid this self-sabotage; so very small, very achievable steps taken with great consistency is the way to help yourself.</p>
<p>Even one moment of coming back to the present moment is transformative, and can be the launching pad for other great things.</p>
<p>But take care with this notion of 'fixing yourself'. This sets up a judging and manipulative relationship with your mind. If you proceed on this basis you will always be checking yourself to see how you're doing, and comparing and judging will follow, and all those trains of thought that lead to the vicious cycle of despondency, avoidance of that feeling, and acting out.</p>
<p>So instead of thinking of yourself or your life as something broken that has to be fixed, aim at the positive and start replacing negative behavior with positivity in small, consistent ways.</p>
<p>Finally, your environment and relationships are very influential. Inner and outer worlds condition each other. Doing one thing to make your living space more clear and beautiful will be noticed by your inner self. Spending time with clear, kind, spiritually aligned people will support that part of you. If nothing else, spending some time in natural settings will remind you of your innate fresh and clear mind.</p>
