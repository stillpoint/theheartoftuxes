  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Story is bullshit; that's not you. Don't attach to your stories. Billions and billions of stories have come and gone on this Earth. They all return to... what? Story comes and goes; that's not you. What you really are doesn't come and go.</p>
<p>Have you ever stubbed your toe?</p>
<p>That moment is very clear.</p>
<p>It's your <em>thinking</em> that causes confusion. But in the moment when you stub your toe, who you are is very clear: "Owwwww!!!"</p>
<p>This is clarity not disrupted by thinking. But if you want to be clear in life without having to always stub your toe, that means you have to do correct freedom-from-thinking practice.</p>
<p>In particular, a very good practice for someone who has the aspiration and energy (some may say the <em>desperation</em>) to carry it out is self-inquiry. This means turning your attention around to its source, trying to find your own mind.</p>
<p>There are some slight differences in form of the practice, but self-inquiry is a strong thread for instance in the teachings of the great Hindu master Sri Ramana Maharshi, and in Korean Zen (see <em>hwadu</em> and <em>immoko</em>). The great Korean Zen master Kusan Sunim's book <a href="http://selfdefinition.org/zen/Way-of-Korean-Zen-clearscan.pdf"><em>The Way Of Korean Zen</em></a> gives a very good introduction to the practice (starting p. 59). Sri Ramana Maharshi also gives an introduction in the books <em>Who Am I?</em> and <a href="http://selfdefinition.org/ramana/Ramana%20Maharshi%20-%20Be%20As%20You%20Are--The%20Teachings%20of%20Sri%20Ramana%20Maharshi--Godman.pdf"><em>Be As You Are</em></a> (starting p. 29; and see also the useful section on misconceptions about the practice). Ramana Maharshi's teaching is quite a bit more ensconced in jargon and philosophy, though Maharshi himself was very clear.</p>
<p>But a couple of cautionary points: First; these are two different traditions and practices, and though each can lead to insight you shouldn't mix them; you can learn from each, but choose only one to learn and practice. If you are interested, check out Korean Zen centers in your area, or Arunachala ashrams in New York, Nova Scotia, or India. (There may be other teachers of self-inquiry besides; but do your proper research to make sure they're reputable and capable traditional teachers.)</p>
<p>Second; if you want to practice you should find a proper teacher to transmit the method and to point out where to look. Once you have learned well and digested the training, then you can do the practice on your own.</p>
<p>Self-inquiry requires ongoing commitment; so you really have to want to actively find out who you are. This is not a good method for someone who only dabbles or comes and goes with practice. A good teacher is your primary support. A practice community, practice place, schedule, and lifestyle changes can form additional supports.</p>
<p>If there's one take-away from all this, it's that you can't know with your thinking-understanding alone. You actually have to find out; you have to get the experience of seeing for yourself. But by the same token, don't think that seeing for yourself will mean that you necessarily get a thinking-style answer. When you look for the self, you soon reach a point where you can't go any further; it's like you're stuck, or quiet. It's an unknowing. Here, you just rest. No need to make or get anything else. This open unknowing is already your true self; and the more you rest in it, the more it becomes established in you. Then one day it emerges very clearly in your awareness.</p>
<p>If you have a bit of a faithful mind and the ability to let go of your story, there are many other methods that can reveal your true nature to you. Many courses of training will calm your mind to the point where it is unified, which is essentially the same point as is reached in self-inquiry. But since you seemed to have some urgency to your question, that energy may be put to good use in self-inquiry.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>On a different note, it often behooves us in this forum to acknowledge that meditation <em>is not</em> the solution for everything. And in fact, it is often much better to do other activities and get other experiences besides or even instead of meditation.</p>
<p>I think for young people this is especially true. While meditation may turn out to be an important part or even basis of your life, there are many other things that you should likely be trying out. Our society is up in its head. A lot of people in our society are very attached to thought, and not very grounded in real life. This is where so much doubt and confusion arise. And shutting yourself in a room to meditate won't necessarily address that well.</p>
<p>In your late teens and twenties, it's the summer of your life, when all kinds of new growth are appearing and maturing. It's important in this time to try many things, and even to risk making mistakes. I mean, don't go rushing headlong into stupidity, thinking it's the only way to learn something; but take some appropriate risks. This is one of the ways you find out what you're on about. If you've been sheltered, start coming out. Travel. Volunteer. Work. Dip your toe into new waters. Be willing to witness suffering. Be willing to encounter difficulty. At first glance it seems like a fearsome proposition, but upon reading this invitation, is there not something in you that comes alive?</p>
<p>Since our society habitually lives up in the head, many of us try to know everything before we take a step. That totally sabotages our flow and intuition and inspiration! That's not the natural order of things. As long as you have some <em>reasonable</em> basis of knowledge, the invitation of what you don't yet know can and should be pursued. Go do something new. <em>Then</em> you'll find out if it's for you.</p>
<p>Don't get stuck trying to know. Do! Doing is true knowing. You express who you are when you are active and engaged. Having a definition or label for it is not necessary.</p>
<p>When you shop for clothing, do you stick to your preconception, never straying from the norm? Or do you try something on that's new? This can be a good practice, a good example of how a young person should engage with life. When you shop for clothes, try something new. You don't have to buy it; you don't have to become that person; but it's good to try on a new persona, see a new perspective. Even if you couldn't imagine being that. Or perhaps precisely <em>because</em> you couldn't imagine being that! Try what you haven't yet imagined. Try what you actively resist. Then at least you'll have some real information to go on.</p>
<p>In short, <em>activity</em>, not thinking, will express who you are. It's not one final definition that you settle on. If you do find yourself settling on a definition, get out immediately! It means you're dying! It's not one final definition; it's flow. When you are active, when you are flowing, you are expressing yourself... <em>whatever that is</em>.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Finally, in case it helps: Some people are simple and consistent; some are complex and diverse. Some live mostly through relationship; some live mostly within themselves. Some are trackers, following signs. Some are dreamers, working through vision and intuition. There are promoters, controllers, analyzers, and supporters. There are those who rely more on feeling, and those who rely more on thinking. There are some who gain energy from others, and some who gain energy from solitude.</p>
<p>Whatever one may think of astrology, for instance, this is one of its beautiful aspects: it gives a picture of infinite possible variations in the ways personal qualities manifest. If you've ever seen an astrological chart, it's quite beautiful. It's beautiful to have the acknowledgement that there are countless possibilities, <em>each with its own true place and purpose</em>. When you see it on the chart, you can understand this kind of acknowledgement. Some charts have all the energies focused in one or two areas of life, or across various areas of life but very strongly in one particular energy. Other charts show a picture of energies spread throughout various talents and relationships.</p>
<p>You don't need to check your story or question your bent of nature. A forest has many beings; but the pine doesn't look down on the mushroom, and the wolf doesn't compare itself to the owl. Each being actively expresses itself, following its job, moment to moment. But because humans are caught in thinking, we don't understand our job. Therefore a discipline of flow, of freedom, is necessary — to express oneself through moment-to-moment activity. Then we can realize that the pine and mushroom and wolf and owl never question what they are, seeking a label; they are too busy being themselves, moving on to the next thing.</p>
