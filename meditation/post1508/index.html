  <h1>How do I form the habit of meditation?</h1>

<p><strong>Being clear about your motivation and the purpose of meditation is vital.</strong> If it isn't clear why you're doing it, you may waver.</p>
<p>The best way I know for clarifying motivation, and the way recommended by many masters, is <strong>awareness of death</strong>. You must know that your life is impermanent, that you will certainly die, and that you don't know when. Further you must know that at the time of death no possession or knowledge or friend can help you; only your spiritual attainment can help you. And finally, this awareness of death has to be deeply felt, and not just remain a vague theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>Next, it is important to <strong>understand exactly what meditation is supposed to do</strong> for you. How does it contribute to spiritual attainment?</p>
<p>When you are clear on the situation you are in, you will have motivation to practice. If you think, like most of us habitually do, that you have all the time in the world to do whatever you please, it will be difficult to muster deep motivation.</p>
<p>But motivation isn't the sole factor. The next question is <strong>how to shift from current habit to a new, beneficial habit, and then to no habit at all</strong>.</p>
<p>On your own, you can <strong>link your meditation with certain triggers</strong> throughout your day, letting it become part of your routine. Associate it with jumping out of bed in the morning, or doing it as part of some other daily ritual like exercise time, coming home time, preparing for bed time and so on. That way it can become as natural as brushing your teeth every day.</p>
<p>You can <strong>reinforce the routine by recognizing the payoff</strong>. You can take a moment after meditation to reflect on your movement away from harmful patterns and toward noble goals. If you experience less negative thought or agitation after your meditation, you can take a moment to note that, and to be thankful for the path that leads to ever greater peace and stability. Although in general we try not to attach to results in meditation, for complete beginners it can be very helpful to take some conscious moments to realize not only the good effects of the particular session, but to realize and rejoice in the potential for becoming a better person — kind, aware, noble, self-possessed. This is who you originally are, so it's good to reinforce that view.</p>
<p>The rest of your life activity has a huge impact on whether you carry out your meditation, and on how clearly and deeply it unfolds. <strong>Correct diet</strong>, eating schedule, and amount of food taken has a big impact. <strong>Correct sleep</strong>, in both schedule and quality, has a big impact. Getting a good balance of enjoyable <strong>activity</strong> and exercise is important.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging around with clear, sincere people</strong> will help you tremendously. Avoiding people who indulge in pettiness or meaningless entertainment, who exchange selfish or violent thoughts, whose minds are uncontrolled, who chase after sensual pleasure, or otherwise contribute to ungroundedness or distract from the Great Way are to be avoided until you have your own strong center.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>keeping correct, caring relationship</strong> with those people you do encounter will also prepare your mind for correct meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your living space clean, spacious, and orderly</strong>, and decorating it simply with flowers or with images of peace and enlightenment, will help to turn your mind toward meditation. Much of the time, your mind is dull and wandering around for something to consume, like a jackal scavenging for carcasses. In these times, it is like you are in a trance: anything that appears before you has the power to lead your mind around. So if you surround yourself with negative or confusing influences, your mind will easily get led around by them. If you surround yourself with clarity and space and things that point to a more noble life, that is where you can lead your mind.</p>
<p>Your mind is most suggestible when you are just coming out of sleep. It usually happens that whatever your thought or mood is when you wake up, it will continue throughout the day. You can use this in a couple of ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may lie in bed and feel yourself returning to physical form, bringing awareness back to your body and away from dreaming and wandering. You can then consciously turn your mind toward your highest aspiration, calling on the Buddha or God or the deity that you work with, or calling on your own highest nature to lead you. You can embrace the day thankfully as a chance to improve and become clear and free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may instead jump immediately out of bed, not giving wandering thoughts a chance to take hold but rather starting the day with great vigor and clarity of purpose. Quickly splash cold water on your face, then right away take your seat on the meditation mat and begin practice. If you do a preliminary practice like vows or prostrations, this is also a good time to do it. This way you start your day very clearly and strongly, without wavering or procrastinating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, <strong>people can't change based on motivation and understanding alone</strong>. Often, not even arranging your life on your own will help you form a good practice routine. Therefore <strong>surrender to an external practice structure</strong> is necessary. That means finding and submitting to a teacher, a group, and a course of study. Weekly teachings, bi-weekly meditation sessions, and retreats with a daily schedule will all be of benefit. It will also be of benefit just to be around strong practitioners, to see how they do it and to ingest their interest, devotion, and good qualities.</p>
