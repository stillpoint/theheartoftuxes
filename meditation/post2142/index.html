  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It's possible.</p>
<p>It's possible that it has nothing to do with meditation.</p>
<p>10 hours is almost certainly oversleeping. All else being equal, it's best (healthiest) to go to sleep before 11pm and wake before sunrise. Although having too little sleep puts a burden on the body, having too much sleep is worse because it put a burden on the spirit (the energy and faculty of presence).</p>
<p>Tiredness and inability to sleep deeply are two separate symptoms. They may be symptoms of a variety of different ailments. Check with your doctor, and follow up with an alternative health practitioner if you are concerned. Whereas Western Medicine is best at identifying and treating acute conditions (which is why you should visit your medical doctor first), Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, and other alternative modalities are often found to be helpful in chronic and less distinct conditions.</p>
<p>Sometimes the change of season affects an already susceptible constitution. The dampness and heat of summer can affect the digestion, for instance, prompting lassitude and grogginess. Allergies may play into the unrest. Diminished nourishment may make the restorative processes of sleep less effective. There are many possible causes. More investigation is needed; you can't necessarily pin it on meditation.</p>
<p>If you find that you are <em>agitated</em> in and after meditation, though, it may mean that you are not doing it properly or that your attitude, approach, or method has changed. Sometimes this happens without one being aware of it. It is especially likely when one practices along, as one is not receiving the ongoing teaching and feedback that can bring issues to awareness and correct mistakes.</p>
<p>A great many meditators find that during intense practice sleep is affected. During retreats, for instance, just at the time when one feels one <em>really</em> needs a good sleep, one may remain wakeful through the entire night. The wakeful nature of practice — the <em>Yang</em> — has not been balanced with the <em>Yin</em> of ease and release. It may have to do with new and stressful circumstances in the place of retreat. It may have to do with the constitution of the meditator (as many meditators tend to be quite sensitive and even skittish). It may have to do with the application of practice, in a hard, striving style rather than settling and trusting.</p>
<p>In these cases, you either just continue and let things work themselves out, or you may consider how to bring more Yin into your practice and into your day. Only sitting for longer, longer, longer, doesn't suit most humans. Other practice is necessary. This is yet another reason why traditional training is more complete than practicing along: traditional training tends to embrace a more holistic path. Work practice helps one taper into everyday life. Walking, prostrations, and other physical practices help circulate and smooth the energy, and 'turn the world energy', bringing global perspective (as opposed to the self-centeredness of 'me' sitting on the mat and stewing in my own drama). Interactive practice eases and broadens the heart, brings joy, and encourages spontaneity. All these effects, and more, have influence on sleep.</p>
<p>Our egoic patterns don't just disappear the moment we sit down on the mat. Not only our patterns of approach, but the very pathways of energy tend to continue, even if our activity seems 'spiritual' from the outside.</p>
<p>In society and in our daily lives, we tend to live up in our heads. Our energy gets stuck there. Then we read about spiritual practice, and more things go into the head. Then we talk about it and think about it, and yet more head-stuff appears. Then when we finally sit in meditation, and that head-centered pattern tends to dictate our experience. Even when we get bright, clear meditation energy, it still tends to stick in the head. If we do longer sittings without practices that encourage dissipation and flow, that energy stagnates.</p>
<p>Physical practice brings energy down out of the head and into its low seat in the body. We all experience this in the relaxed comfort we feel after vigorous exercise or play. After vigorous activity and deep breathing, we are ready to rest. It is very natural. So physical practice is a helpful (and I would say <em>necessary</em>) part of the whole course of training. And this is only one of the many beneficial aspects of physical practice.</p>
<p>Besides prostrations, sun salutations, hindu squats, or other rhythmic whole-body-and-breath activities, you might derive benefit from practices that specifically dissipate stuck energy. Taking some time after each sitting to dissipate energy stuck in the head could prove beneficial.</p>
<p>After each sitting period, you can rub your hands together to warm them up, then cup the eyes for a few seconds or a minute, and cup the ears for a few seconds or a minute. Then tap the skull with your fingertips — the crown, the brow, the back, the temples, and especially the notches under the rim of the skull, next to the neck muscles. These depressions are significant way-points for the circulation of energy. Tapping on them with the fingers is called 'Beating the heavenly drum' in Taoist energy arts. It will likely feel very pleasant, and you will notice how energy and tension can build up there, and how there's a sort of nice-feeling resonance or echo that happens when you tap or massage there.</p>
<p>You can also carefully massage and/or stretch your shoulders and the rest of your body, to help energy move and dissipate. Using rollers or massage balls can be helpful, and a nice thing to do for your body after requiring it to sit still for long periods.</p>
<p>Qigong, Taiji, Kung Fu, many forms of Yoga, and other energy arts usually have their own specific dissipating exercises to encourage energy stuck up in the head to soften and move. If stuck energy is an issue for you, these practices along with physical practice like prostrations, and generally moving more in your life, will certainly help you.</p>
<p>Instead of only making sittings longer, consider doing 15 minutes of prostrations or sun salutations before a 45-minute period of sitting. Your sitting may become deeper and easier, and in any case, it's a better balance. Then, after sitting, do some dissipation. Maybe take a walk before bed. Some gentle physical activity is good, but many find that vigorous activity before bed is too agitating. Then you can 'say goodnight' to your altar: just have a moment of calmness and gratitude and letting go of the day. You can view a lovely image, if you have a picture or statue of Buddha, for example; you can take in the ease and compassion. Or maybe gaze at a flower or out at the night sky. Very simple, no special effort, just taking in something lovely — something that invites you into your big at-home mind.</p>
