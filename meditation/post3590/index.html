  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p><strong>Hakuin's Naikan Therapy</strong></p>
<p>For Meditation Sickness &amp; Nervous Debility</p>
<p>(translated in John Stevens, <em>Three Zen Masters</em>)</p>
<p>&gt; Imagine a duck egg-sized lump of the sweetest, most fragrant cream on the crown of your head. let it melt gradually downward through your body, filling every pore, flushing out all sickness and disease as it spreads to the soles of your feet. As the warm cream circulates back up through the body, the internal organs are purified, the skin becomes radiant, and the equilibrium of body and mind is restored.</p>
<p>&gt; The visualization and envisioned feeling of being melted, purified, and flushed may take some effort to establish; but after a time you get better at it. The more you believe the blockages and impurities are being resolved, the more it is accomplished in reality.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku#Zen_sickness"><em>Hakuin Ekaku</em></a> Wikipedia entry:</p>
<p>&gt;Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a nervous breakdown by Western medicine. He called it Zen sickness, and sought the advice of a Taoist cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a visualization and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms. From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue. The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Another brief mention of meditation sickness, from Kusan Sunim in <em>The Korean Way Of Zen</em>:</p>
<p>&gt;Sometimes the body's vital energy rises to the head and
creates tension. When this happens, you should hold your
will as firm as a mountain and make your mind as calm as
the sea. Sit erect on your cushion and gently focus the sense
of questioning into a point three fingers below the navel [the dantien].</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A longer account from <em>Hakuin's Precious Mirror Cave</em> translated by Norman Waddell:</p>
<p>&gt;On the day I first committed myself to a life of Zen practice, I pledged to summon all the faith and courage at my command and dedicate myself with steadfast resolve to the pursuit of the Buddha Way. I embarked on a regimen of rigorous austerities that I continued for several years, pushing myself relentlessly. One night, everything suddenly fell away.</p>
<p>&gt;All the doubts and uncertainties that had been burdening me over the years suddenly disappeared, roots and all, just like melted ice. Karmic roots that for endless kalpas had  bound me to the cycle of birth and death completely vanished, like foam on the water.</p>
<p>&gt;It is true, I thought to myself, the Way is not far from people. All those stories about the ancient masters taking twenty or even thirty years to attain it must be fabrications. For the next several months I was waltzing on air, flagging my arms and stamping my feet in mindless rapture.</p>
<p>&gt;Afterwards, as I began reflecting over my everyday behavior, I could see that the two aspects of my life—the active and the meditative—were totally out of balance. No matter what I was doing, I never felt free or completely at ease. I realized I would have to rekindle a fearless resolve and once again throw myself life and limb together into the Dharma struggle. With my teeth clenched tightly and eyes focused straight ahead, I began devoting myself single-mindedly to my practice, forsaking food and sleep altogether.</p>
<p>&gt;Before the month was out, my heart-fire began to rise upward against the natural course, parching my lungs of their essential fluid. My feet and legs were ice-cold; they felt as though they were immersed in tubs of snow. There was a continual thrumming in my ears, as though I was walking beside a raging mountain torrent. I became abnormally weak and timid, shrinking and fearful in whatever I did. I felt totally drained, physically and mentally exhausted. Strange visions appeared to me during waking and sleeping hours alike. My eyes watered constantly. I traveled far and wide, visiting wise Zen teachers and seeking out noted physicians, but none of the remedies they offered brought me any relief.</p>
<p>...[an account of traveling and meeting Hakuin follows]...</p>
<p>&gt;I persisted, begging repeatedly for his help. At last, he reached out and gently took my hand. He proceeded to read my nine pulses and examine my five bodily organs. His fingernails, I noted were almost an inch long.</p>
<p>&gt;Furrowing his brow, he spoke with a voice tinged with pity. "Not much can be done. You have developed a serious illness. By pushing yourself too hard, you forgot the cardinal rule of religious training. You are suffering from Zen sickness, which is extremely difficult to cure by medical means. If you attempted to treat it with acupuncture, moxabustion, or medicines, it would do you no good. You came to this grievous pass as a result of meditation. You will never regain your health unless you are able to master the techniques of Naikan meditation. It is just as the old saying has it: "When a person falls to the earth, it is from the earth that he must raise himself up."</p>
<p>&gt;"Please," I said, "teach me the secret technique of Naikan meditation. I want to practice it together with my Zen training."</p>
<p>&gt;With a demeanor that was now solemn and majestic, Master Hakuyu softly and quietly replied, "Ahh, I can see that you're a very determined young man. I suppose I can tell you a few things about Naikan meditation that I learned many years ago. It is a secret method for sustaining life known to few people. Practiced diligently, it will yield remarkable results and enable you to look forward to a long life as well."</p>
<p>&gt;"When a student is training and meditating and finds that he has become exhausted in body and mind because the four constituent elements of this body are in disharmony, he should gird up his spirit and perform the following visualization:</p>
<p>&gt;"Imagine a lump of soft butter, pure in color and fragrance and the size and shape of a duck egg, is suddenly placed on the top of your head. Slowly it begins to melt, imparting an exquisite sensation as your head becomes moistened and saturated both within and without. It continues oozing down, moistening your shoulders, elbows, and chest, permeating your lungs, diaphragm, liver, stomach, and bowels, then continuing down the spine through the hips, pelvis, and buttucks.</p>
<p>&gt;"At that point, all the congestions that have accumulated within the five organs and six viscera, all the aches and pains in the abdomen and other affected parts, will follow the mind as it sinks down into the lower body. You will hear this distinctly—like water trickling from a higher to a lower place. It will continue to flow down through the body, suffusing the legs with beneficial warmth, until reaches the arches of the feet, where it stops.</p>
<p>&gt;"The student should then repeat the contemplation. As the flow continues downward, it will slowly fill the lower region of the body and suffuse it with penetrating warmth, making him feel as if he is sitting immersed to his navel in a hot bath filled with a decoction of rare and fragrant medicinal herbs that have been gathered and slowly infused by a skilled physician.</p>
<p>&gt;"In as much as all things are created by the mind, when you engage in this contemplation your nose will actually smell the marvelous scent of pure soft butter, your body will feel the exquisite sensation of its melting touch. Body and mind will be in perfect peace and harmony. You will feel better than you did as a youth of twenty or thirty.</p>
<p>&gt;"All the undesirable accumulations in your vital organs and viscera will melt away. Before you know it, your skin will glow with health. If you continue to practice this contemplation unfalteringly, there is no illness that cannot be cured, no virtue that cannot be acquired, no religious practice that cannot be mastered, no level of sage-hood that cannot be reached. Whether such results appear swiftly or appear slowly depends only upon how scrupulously you apply yourself.</p>
<p>&gt;"I was a very sickly youth. I experienced ten times the suffering you have endured. The doctors finally gave up on me. I explored hundreds of cures on my own, but none of them brought me any relief. I turned to the gods for help, praying to the deities of both heaven and earth, begging them for their imperceptible assistance. I was marvelously blessed, because they extended me their support and protection. I came upon this wonderful soft butter method of contemplation. My joy knew no bounds. I immediately set about practicing it with total and single-minded determination. Before even a month was out, my troubles had almost totally vanished. Since that time I've never been bothered the least bit by any complaint, physical or mental.</p>
<p>&gt;"Young man, you have just learned a secret that you could not use up in a whole lifetime. What more could I teach you?"</p>
