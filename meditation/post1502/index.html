  <h1>ideas for meditations for 2 people to do together.</h1>

<p>I can share some practices for greater intimacy with a partner or other close one, but as mentioned elsewhere the word "meditation" is being used so broadly that it's losing its proper and helpful boundaries. <em>Meditation</em> is a specific act with a specific aim and effect. If we use the word as an umbrella term for countless other practices we should be well aware that while the practices may (or may not) be beneficial in their own way we may not be practicing correct meditation.</p>
<p>This brings us to a couple of points raised by your post. First; while you ask about practices for bringing people closer the majority of your post is a practice that you have thought up. It is not clear whether you are actually asking and looking into practices that may require some commitment and sacrifice, or whether you are just taking the opportunity to share something you thought up.</p>
<p>If we get into thinking up practices we should take to heart that those practices will come from our present state of awareness and ignorance — they will automatically include the blind spots that we have in our life. They go only as far as we can guess and imagine. One of the great benefits of established or even traditional practices is that they have largely emerged from the teachings of great beings who are far beyond the common person in terms of insight and perspective — much of the human shadow has been removed from the equation. Even so, pratices and practitioners and traditions each have their shadow sides, and we should keep in mind the things that may be held back or ignored or denied by any practice.</p>
<p>Especially in terms of partner meditations, which are bound to be charged by sexual energy, contradictory yearnings for solitude versus companionship, control versus surrender, one's own agenda and pacing versus another's, and grasping versus aversion, inventing your own practice may turn out to be a way of steering the relationship toward your way of seeing things, or a way of avoiding the things you keep yourself unaware of.</p>
<p>Quick litmus test: are you willing to undergo the same practice with people you feel neutral about or with people you are disgusted with or hate?</p>
<p>Second; what is the intent? It is not clear what kind of "closer" we are talking about, and whether in fact it is a beneficial movement or a movement based on attachment, co-dependency, or fantasy. You sum up the suggested practice by saying "end however you like although sex is probably (sp) the best option." "<em>However you like</em>" is very vague, and invites the ego and your habitual attachment to pleasure to be the driving force behind your behavior. This is willingly stepping into ignorance. To say that "sex is probably the best option" may betray your real motive. If closeness were the true aim, there would not have to be any prejudice toward sexual activity. But to suggest that sex is essentially more ideal than any other activity together is to add your own desire and viewpoint to the practice. As I wrote above, this may be your conscious or unconscious way of steering things toward your own ends.</p>
<p>Your spontaneity and willingness are laudable, but recklessness is perhaps an issue to be careful of. Your writing, for example, doesn't include capitalization of the initial letter of sentences, nor helpful divisions of paragraphs. This may indicate an aversion to meticulously following form, to the extent that others have to bear the burden of your own carefree ways. This attitude doesn't bode well for highly charged practices of mutual surrender. You need to find your own center, your own balance and ability to surrender before going swooning into others or thinking that you can lead a meditation process for someone else.</p>
<p>If we get down to it, correct meditation already brings us to greater intimacy with others. One may assume that since you're sitting by yourself on a mat your experience only has to do with yourself; but that is far from the reality. One sits not as a separate, solitary agent, but as an expression of all of life. Repeatedly freeing oneself from trains of thought, one strengthens the willingness to give up one's own opinion, which becomes compassion. Repeatedly returning to open-handed presence, one trains the ability to let truth appear by itself, which becomes wisdom. Together, these are intimacy: putting down "I, my, me" and allowing inner and outer to merge.</p>
<p>Before you are reliably able to put down your own desires and opinions, movements toward intimacy will almost surely be colored by your own ego's agenda. You don't realize it at first. But if you practice correct meditation with meticulous form, the form will reflect your mind to you: it will show you clearly the times when you drift away or resist, and it will give you the opportunity to practice surrendering the mind habits behind the drifting and resisting. If you can stick with proper meditation, your intimacy will grow, and you can engage in partner work sincerely. Those who are too resistant to the surrender of correct meditation tend to make up practices to suit their own wandering ways.</p>
<p>Best wishes. If you are still interested in specific intimacy-growing practices we can talk about it some more.</p>
