  <h1>Why do people who meditate have their hands in weirdly specific positions?</h1>

<p>The hand positions are called <em>mudra</em> in Sanskrit. But while the word is used to refer to the hand postures, really everything is <em>mudra</em>. Trees are the mudra of seed, earth, sun, and water relating in a specific way. Crystals are mudra. Rivers are mudra. Cities are mudra.</p>
<p>In human life, mudra is everywhere. Stock market hand signals are mudra, as is the stock market itself. A stoplight is a mudra; and the hand sign on some crosswalk signals is the mudra for "don't walk". Handshakes and hugs and fistfights are mudra; and eating cereal, taking a shower, and mowing the lawn are also mudra.</p>
<p>Everything is a configuration. Forms and energies relate to each other, and take specific shapes and postures. Form follows the mind and energy that created it, and mind is influenced by the forms and energies it contacts.</p>
<p>So for instance, a baby grabbing for its mother's breast is performing the mudra of "want food, want mama". That is the pure expression of a specific energy and intention. Adults may even repeat that mudra back to the baby, opening and closing their hands as they connect to the baby and to its innocent, reaching hunger.</p>
<p>When you're trying to see across a lake at midday you hold your hand up to shield your eyes from the glare of the sun in the mudra of seeing far. When you're trying to calm down an angry person, you may open your hands and move your palms downward toward the floor in the mudra of "don't boil over" or "keep it together". These movements have an archetypal quality, as symbols that are shared so commonly that they are part of the global human consciousness: it doesn't matter what culture you're from or what language you speak, the energy of the seeing-far mudra or the settle-down mudra can be understood. (Many postures and energies are even shared and understood by the animal world, and further, there are mudra that are very universally shared, like the constellations of stars in the night sky.)</p>
<p>The other side of expression is that the movements also call on and impose the energies they symbolize. If you hold your hands in tight fists, it's almost impossible not to feel at least tension and determination, if not outright anger. If you then let your hands relax open, palms up at chest level, the accepting and open-hearted quality can be felt in distinct contrast to the previously held fists. In fact, this open-handed palm-up posture is a classical meditation mudra that helps to call up and cultivate openness, generosity, and receptivity.</p>
<p>A third aspect of mudra is more esoteric: the governance of energy flow in the body. In spiritual or shamanic technologies that address energy flow in specific ways, the body is a critical tool in harnessing and directing the flow. Without control and participation of the body, directing energy and mind is much more difficult. In modern western knowledge, there is a yet primitive but growing awareness of these connections, which have been studied and refined in the spiritual traditions of other cultures (especially Indian, Chinese, and Tibetan) for many centuries. One example is the current controversy in western science over whether specific eye movements relate to the way we access different areas of the brain, and whether looking up and to the left, for instance, indicates a fabrication rather than a memory. While the connection between specific eye movements and specific ways of using the brain is not clear, it <em>is</em> accepted that eye and face movements do have <em>some</em> connection to our inner intent and experience.</p>
<p>Of course, if we take it to a very basic level, a smile with direct gaze becomes a very clear mudra of joyfulness and kindness. At more subtle levels, moving the eyes in certain directions is said to guide the energy through certain channels in the body. Some of these channels have endpoints in the fingers, so touching fingers together in specific patterns connects the inner pathways for the sake of building, circulating, or suppressing certain energies.</p>
<p>One very important inner connection is the connection that completes the circuit that travels up the spine to the top of the head and down the front of the body to the bottom of the pelvic floor. Keeping the tongue in contact with the hard palate at the roof of the mouth is a recommendation found in many different meditation systems, and the reason for this is, in general, to promote the circulation of energy through these important channels. On this energetic level, concentration and meditative attainments can all be seen as based on patterns of circulation — if not (seen as) the circulation itself.</p>
<p>The more subtle influences will certainly not be noticed by a meditator until he or she has developed that level of subtlety. (Or in energetic terms, until he or she has opened those circuits.) So there is a vast body of knowledge available regarding meditation that seems arcane or even ridiculous simply because the meditator is still operating at a gross, relatively unconscious level.</p>
<p>Until greater consciousness and subtlety has been achieved, one may have to rely upon the good advice of those who have progressed farther. It is still possible, though perhaps not ideal, to progress on the basis of one's own efforts and experimentation. Even if you waste time on side issues that have no significance, <em>that</em> experience can still be beneficial. For example, someone who has traveled to Miami many times can help you get there quickly and without much trouble. But if you choose not to listen to them you may end up in Jersey, or Seattle, or Minsk. You may still eventually find your way to Miami, and you will have gathered some other experience, including experience about how <em>not</em> to get to Miami. But if the aim is to get to Miami, it is up to you to choose whether to fulfill that aim by following guidance or whether to proceed solely based on your current level of knowledge/ignorance.</p>
