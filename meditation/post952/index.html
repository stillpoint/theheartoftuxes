  <h1>Holding your breath during mediation, safe or not?</h1>

<p>Unsafe in what way, is the question. You're not going to kill yourself, if that's what you mean. But you will ingrain wrong relationship with your mind. This is not by virtue of the breathing alone, but by dint of the way you use it to manipulate your mind. That is incorrect relationship, and it will easily grow into a bad pattern not only within yourself but in your interaction with others and with the world around you.</p>
<p>You have the idea that your mind has to be clear... of what? Of thoughts? If the thoughtless state were superior, then worms would be further along on the path than us, and rocks or clods of dirt would be like masters. Attachment to clear mind is a big sickness in meditation. Although clear mind is very important as it reveals your original nature, its function <em>in relationship with life</em> is the main point of practice. How can your clarity function as wisdom and compassion? That's the main thing. You don't just use it for your own pleasure, like a drug.</p>
<p>It is not absence of thought that we seek, but rather non-attachment to thought.</p>
<p>If you try to manipulate your mind with your breath, it will be ridiculously easy for your ego to take the upper hand. The very reason we have blind spots, neuroses, unconscious behavior, and habits of thinking and acting, is that we do not see the illusion of self operating in our lives, and we do not see how it controls us. Therefore it is a practical certainty that your self-manipulation will become (if it isn't already) an ego agenda, fraught with delusion and attachment. This goes completely contrary to the purpose of meditation.</p>
<p>Breath retention and breath control is indeed used in many meditative courses of training; but within a correct context, within a structure that can maintain your right direction when you yourself are apt to lose it. This structure includes these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right motivation comes first. You have to know and sincerely buy into the <em>right</em> reason for the practice — which is the same as the right reason for your life. Right motivation is not only "for me" but for all others. Without that motivation, gaining power, even power over yourself, just becomes greater corruption and greater cause for suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A responsible guide. A teacher who is not only consistently present and able to oversee your progress and correct the times when you fall off the path, but who is consistently able to provide the view beyond ego, to go beyond like and dislike and stand up for awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A correct method and course of training. The practice should have an appropriate function in the larger scheme of your spiritual progress. It is not something you just toy with for temporary satisfaction, as that will not serve to further your life or the lives of others. There should be a step-by-step course of practice, with one attainment forming the foundation for the next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that all practice is formulaic — instructions vary according to one's personal capacity and situation, and sometimes steps overlap or come in different order. This is why a skilled teacher is necessary — someone who has already traveled the territory we're traveling — to identify what adaptations need to be made, and when the time is right for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Correct understanding and application of method. You have to have a clear method and understand its intended purpose. You have to know the method well, and you have to follow it properly. Vagueness has no place in meditation; vagueness has no place when dealing with one's sanity and awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct setting. Some practices are inherently more volatile, as they seek to manipulate various aspects of the bodymind. These practices require a safe container, which may include a clean and calm space in which to meditate, a supportive attitude from those in the vicinity, a group or community of other practitioners, a regular schedule of practice (and complementary study, to understand the intents and effects of the practice), and in some cases very detailed guidelines for regulating diet, sleep, exercise, ethical behavior, and lifestyle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When those elements of the right practice structure are in place, breathwork can be a very powerful aid. Lacking any of the elements, breathwork can be a very powerful hindrance and even a destructive influence. Or, it could just be a somewhat benign waste of time and sidetrack that occupies you for some years or lifetimes.</p>
<p>The <em>pure</em> practice is to let it all be. Let the breathing be what it naturally is; let the mind be what it naturally is. Rest in ungrasping. This is the expression of the mind that is <em>already</em> complete. It is your original enlightenment, which doesn't need to be made or controlled or enhanced in any way. Mere belief is not enough; you have to do it. But opening the hands and putting it all down for a moment is its pure expression. One moment of Unknowing is one moment of awakening. There's no making or holding involved in that, so no forcing your breath or mind to do anything.</p>
