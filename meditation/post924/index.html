  <h1>Meditation when it's particularly difficult for whatever reason?</h1>

<p>Some questions to illuminate practice:</p>
<p>*What constitutes "easier"?</p>
<p>*When does one judge meditation as "working" or "not working"?</p>
<p>*What defines "wasting" time in meditation?</p>
<p>*From whence does struggling arise?</p>
<p>*Does meditation depend on feeling a certain way?</p>
<p>The language in your post reveals some preconceptions about meditation: that it's supposed to look and feel a certain way, otherwise it is a waste of time. Where does that idea come from?</p>
<p>The struggling is not inherent in the situation. You bring it in. Even if the mind is flying around wildly, there is only struggle if you decide that that's not okay <em>and</em> you try to force your mind not to be that way. That's not meditation, that's judging and forcing.</p>
<p>The proper attitude in meditation is complete and utter openhandedness. It is not for you to judge some situations and good and others as bad. That's illusion. Good and bad come from your own thinking, and make an illusory world of opposites. The real world just is as it is.</p>
<p>So "as-is" is the realm of meditation. Calm mind is no problem, busy mind is no problem. It's the awareness that can <em>see</em> the calm or busy mind that we are concerned with. Open-handed awareness that stays stable no matter what situation arises â€” like the space in a room that remains stable no matter how the furniture is arranged or what family drama unfolds in it.</p>
<p>How does this awareness become stable? Through the practice of coming back to it, and not letting this or that situation prompt judging, reactionary attitude. All the forms that appear are unreal, ephemeral, temporary; the awareness behind it all is what we are training.</p>
<p>Actually, this awareness already <em>is</em> constant. It is always there, embracing everything that happens. Like a background mind, it is the part of you that is aware of a robin singing outside even when you are arguing with someone. Meditation strengthens your contact with the awareness that is always there. But you have to keep returning without allowing the situation to dictate whether you will apply awareness or not. Equanimity will grow. Concentration will deepen. And even those storms in the thinking mind will settle down. But that's all none of your business; your business is only: return.</p>
<p>Of course, we humans are very, very, very attached to the thinking mind; so it's not quite so simple a matter as just saying "let it be". We get tossed around by our thoughts. All the more reason to persist in meditation â€” so we can be free, not depending on thought or feeling being a certain way.</p>
<p>You should realize that your thinking is conditioned â€” created and influenced â€” by everything else you do in life. For any real progress in meditation, ethical training is an absolute necessity. You can't have a clear mind in meditation if you are hurting others. So you need to look at your character and eliminate the big and small flaws â€” from causing great pain or injury in others, to taking something that doesn't belong to you (something lying in the street, for instance) or telling yourself little lies or being a little lazy in your responsibility. Everything you do makes an imprint on your mind that inevitably <em>must</em> unfold in the future. So taking care of your mind in meditation relies on taking care of your intent and action everywhere else in life.</p>
<p>Next, what you take in has a huge effect on your mind. If you eat junk food non-stop, your body will suffer tremendously and your mind can hardly help but be disturbed. A similar indigestion occurs with the things you take in through your eyes and ears and conceptualizing. Violent or pornographic images, accusations, gossip, meaningless and trivial information, and pointless philosophizing are all damaging junk food for the mind. A messy, undignified living space, attire, or body will likewise promote disturbed thinking.</p>
<p>The flip side is that you can do so much to help your mind be calm, stable, balanced, and happy. Doing positive, kind, generous action contributes to a meditative mind. Organizing and cleaning your living space, and washing your body and wearing clean and dignified clothing helps you to be calm, fresh, spacious, noble. Refraining from meaningless talk and entertainment, and instead taking in good teaching, encouraging others with your words, and honoring silence all help develop your inner peace.</p>
<p>You can start almost anywhere, turning your attitude to one of service and harmony: "How can I improve this? How can I improve my relationship to it?" Taking a used cup back to the sink and washing it helps settle the mind. Apologizing for a mistake and asking forgiveness helps settle the mind. Stepping away from scenes where people are using their minds and hearts in sub-human ways helps settle the mind. All of these things help not only you, but everyone around you.</p>
<p>Being more balanced between mental and physical is also extremely helpful. Most of us are up in the head <em>way</em> too much; and we make the big mistake of thinking that meditation is primarily a mental practice. Physical activity, mindfulness of the body, and physical self-acceptance are big parts of the calming process of meditation. When the mind races, there's hardly anything more helpful than doing prostrations, going for a run or bike ride or swim, dancing, or doing yogic sun salutations.</p>
<p>In terms of meditation technique, you need to be very clear on your chosen method: why you choose it, what the steps are, and how to carry them out. That clarity will translate to clarity within meditation. When thoughts run wild, make a special effort to be compassionate and open-handed with them. This will help you become someone who can be present and clear with <em>others</em> who have busy minds, and someone who can be present and clear when life situations are busy. Let the jaw relax, let the throat open, and let the breath flow without forcing. Offer tension to gravity â€” whatever has built up in the shoulders, face, hands, back, belly, imagine it melting off of you as if it's sinking into the earth; simultaneously, you allow yourself to become heavy rather than holding things up. This helps the energy come down out of your head, where it stirs up thinking, and into a more balanced place in the body. And I'll just repeat: physical activity is very helpful in this regard. If you absolutely can't sit in meditation because of the busy mind, do some vigorous physical meditation like prostrations.</p>
