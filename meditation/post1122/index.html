  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I can't tell you how much you should do. If you were in contact with a live teacher they would be able to guide you more properly.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it <em>tends</em> to be better to do less, but do it more consistently. I don't know your capacity; i.e., your ability to remain undistracted and awake. But for most people we recommend 5 to 10 minutes per sitting at the very beginning. This helps them relax and enjoy the process rather than feeling pressured. By the time their ability begins to grow they have already begun to associate meditation with relaxation and pleasure, and so they have a positive attitude toward it.</p>
<p>When people pressure themselves to do more, more, more, two things often happen: (A) the practice itself gets sloppy, and (B) they experience pressure, discomfort, and disappointment because their capacity doesn't match the demands they put on themselves; thus their practice starts to become erratic, or they may give up altogether.</p>
<p>You might consider whether these things are issues for you. If not, you may do more. Once a person starts meditation class they may do regular sittings of 20, 30, 40, or 60 minutes. Most common among western practice centers are 30 or 40 minute sittings (often in multiples, interspersed with walking), although many Vipassana and Theravada centers have hour-long sessions.</p>
<p>But usually a student is expected to develop their practice at home until they are capable of sitting reasonably comfortably and effectively for the 20 to 60 minutes, at which time they can join the class or ongoing group.</p>
<p>There's a famous exchange in Zen:</p>
<p>&gt;A student asks the master "How long will it take before I can get enlightenment?"</p>
<p>&gt;The master responds: "Ten years, give or take."</p>
<p>&gt;The student, thinking that's quite a long time, replies: "So what if I follow all the instructions completely and make a big, big effort?"</p>
<p>&gt; The master says, "In that case, 15 years."</p>
<p>Of course, it means that the more we push and the more we attach to results, the further we get from pure practice. Pure practice only takes care of the moment. Our <em>aspiration</em> is far-reaching: to try, try, try, for 10,000 years and 10,000 lifetimes without stopping. But our <em>practice</em> is completely momentary, and doesn't check all the time how we compare, how far we've gone, whether it's worth it, and so on. Only very unified with the moment, which means unified with real life.</p>
<p>The first step of clarifying your direction comes first but also continues throughout your spiritual career. It is not something that comes first and then is immediately finished. Over and over, you visit the question "What is my life for? What is this day for? I miraculously have another day of life today; what is its proper use?"</p>
<p>One teacher asks new students, "Why do you eat every day?" That is the same question. Why bother to keep oneself alive? Why bother to do one thing, say meditation, rather than another thing? Asking this basic question gradually clarifies the direction of one's life; and practice follows the direction of one's life. If practice and life are separate or going in different directions, that's a problem.</p>
<p>So this is first and most basic. The reason for it is that without correct direction, even meticulous practice can go wrong. It is very possible to make the ego and ignorance grow while sitting on the mat! It is quite common. So whatever tool you have, whether it's common or very powerful, it can either be used to further a Dharmic purpose (a purpose leading to compassion and wisdom and happiness for everyone) or to further a Samsaric purpose (a selfish purpose leading to suffering).</p>
<p>First: direction. Next: correct method. Choose one proven traditional method, and learn it well, and apply it without guessing or tinkering. When the method is learned very well — <em>why</em> it is done and <em>how</em> it is done — a great many opportunities for doubt are removed. When a particularly engaging train of thought arises, whether it's a very nice thought or a very urgent thought or a very dark thought, the meditator should know exactly what to do with the mind at that moment. That is, returning to the method should be quick and unquestionable. No negotiating with oneself; only return.</p>
<p>The same is true of feelings and mind-states: whether it's pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, only return to the method.</p>
<p>Neutral states are often the most problematic for meditators, because they are not as noticeable among our up-and-down drama of lovely or horrible experience. So when we're with neutral experience for a long time we may tend to shut down and ignore it. It becomes a signal to turn off the attention and drift off, either toward more pleasant feeling or toward more interesting thought. This is common.</p>
<p>This reflects the habitual patterns of ignorance that control us, and that we oppose and overcome through meditation. These are categorized in Buddhism as three patterns, called the Three Poisons: we cling to things we like; we run away from or try to destroy things we don't like; and we ignore things that are neutral.</p>
<p>But in meditation, we maintain a mind that doesn't move — we don't cling, we don't avoid or suppress, and we don't ignore. Only non-moving attention or awareness. That is what the method is for: it helps you to maintain not-moving mind.</p>
<p>But if the method is vague or not trusted, the mind will tend to move in those patterns. At some level, in many cases you drift off in sleepiness because you allow it. Instead of calling yourself back to the method when you drift away, you allow yourself to continue drifting. It is a subtle contract with yourself. Sometimes
the contract even gets more complex, and you agree to allow yourself long periods of drifting off as long as you blame yourself for it later. Our minds work like this.</p>
<p>The pivotal question here is what is "putting in 100% effort"? If you think you must be perfectly attentive without ever wavering, you will start to fight with your mind. Even if you develop strong concentration with this attitude, the attitude itself will make you and others unhappy, because it has a basic aggression at a deep level.</p>
<p>So, again, correct direction is essential; correct attitude and approach are essential. When you recognize that your life and practice are completely intertwined with others, and that your happiness and the happiness of others are bound together, then practice becomes more than just 'for me'. And practice becomes more than just '<em>by</em> me'. Practice is not just you doing something in order to get something; it is the world participating in waking up. This allows the mind to settle deeply. Yes, you try and try; but your trying is not desperate or attached or comparing or blaming.</p>
<p>In view of this, "100% effort" has no struggle or drama to it. It is not "<em>I</em> am making 100% effort". It is only doing it, without any of the Three Poisons (without clinging, aggression, or ignoring). 100% effort is like the way you adjust your backpack strap when it slips: very clear, immediate, and no big deal. That is true 100% effort: no delay, no avoidance, no fight, no trying to get something, no I-my-me story.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you drift off, as soon as you notice it you should quickly and gently return. Sleeping and drifting during meditation is not correct. And fighting with your mind is not correct. There is an in-between way. It is not forceful, but it is clear. Any time you go away, immediately and effortlessly return. Return to the method that you know; return to the object of meditation; and put your trust in returning.</p>
