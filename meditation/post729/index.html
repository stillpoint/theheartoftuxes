  <h1>Some questions from someone who has been practicing solo with about 50% regularity for the last year</h1>

<p>Thank you for your sincere response. That is wonderful that you have been doing meditation to unwind, focus, and become more sane.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So perhaps my aim is to attempt to clarify this?</em></p>
<p>I think that's a great aim. If you know, follow up on that knowledge. If you don't know, find out. Just be sincere about which one applies to you (since a lot of people only pretend to know).</p>
<p>Attempting to clarify your aim could be a life-long pursuit, but it is a most valuable one. <em>Most</em> valuable.</p>
<p>My suggestion: It doesn't come from your thinking. No amount of understanding or figuring-out can grasp it. Only keep asking the question and letting the question work on you.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I have a time period I put aside for it, bow down to wisdom, then inhale 3x in one side, out the other on each side.</em></p>
<p>This is a clear relationship to practice. It is neither better nor worse than many other possible forms; but it is good that it is definite — you can then just do it rather than negotiating with yourself and changing the form every time your feeling or thinking changes. Just doing it is what brings progress in unconditional freedom.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I find it usually takes me a bit less than half a 15 min session to clear my mind of any issues that have come up or are occupying me.</em></p>
<p>This is fine, too. But if it were to take you more time, or if issues were to still flit through your thinking, that would also be fine. Just continue the practice sincerely, not depending on any mind state.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I will usually just sit and focus on my breath, or perhaps focus on 'everything' - the universe, me, me inside the universe, me as a part of the universe, the nature of 'now-ness'...</em></p>
<p>This part — I think you already know — is not clear. You should know what you are doing with your mind when you sit in meditation. If there is doubt about it, you will continue the habit of checking and playing around with your inner or outer condition. You will be more occupied with figuring out whether to focus here or there, or everywhere, or nowhere, than with surrendering your bodymind to the moment.</p>
<p>It is very rare for a newcomer to have both the consistent aspiration and the concentrative ability to do a structureless meditation correctly; the mind wanders too much, and it becomes a wasted opportunity. It is usually much more helpful for newcomers to practice with a very clear form and very clear object.</p>
<p>Among the objects that can lead to insight, the breath is (famously) an almost universally appropriate object for all kinds of meditators; so counting or following the breath is suggested as a practice for most people starting out. Since counting provides more structure, and thus helps you better identify when your mind has wandered, I would recommend it as a good practice for you. There are many other forms of practice that are also fine; the main thing is to choose one and try it consistently. After consistent effort over many months, you will be in a position to consider whether you want to continue to deepen the counting practice or change to a different one.</p>
<p>When starting out, many meditators will reject clear, formal practice. They think of it as oppressive, and feel that they just want to "be". Although that is a valid aspiration, inevitably the vast majority will find that the mind uncontrollably wanders or enters dreamy states. Many won't even be able to distinguish between wandering/dreaming and clarity, which means a lot of wasted time sitting in unhelpful meditation. Months and years can slip by without progress, and dejection can set in. Even though it feels oppressive to work with a very clear form, you should try and keep trying. It is the ego — the control-seeker — that feels oppressed. The spirit, on the other hand, loves and thrives on the structure that keeps bringing you back to presence.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>there is not a lot in the way of organised anything</em></p>
<p>If you can't immediately hook up with a teacher and group, that's no problem. Keep it as an aim. In the meantime, you will have to provide your own supportive setting, both in your environment and in your attitude. A clean, orderly living space will support your meditation, as will clean, comfortable, noble attire and a clean and healthy body.</p>
<p>If you are alone, you have to be your own best friend and cheerleader. Don't allow doubt and discouragement to set in, but stay energetic and curious about meditation. Realize also that you are already part of a community. You are part of the global community of meditators and seekers-after-truth. And you are part of the community of all beings moving toward awakening, all together. You are the river and the ocean, even if sometimes you feel like only a drop of water.</p>
<p>Meditation can be your absolutely favorite thing to do. It's where you and the world get to be exactly what you are. No need to manipulate, no need to grasp, no need to escape. Very comfortable!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
