  <h1>Essential Oils</h1>

<p>Thank you for clarifying your situation. I think it's great that you are taking steps to help yourself. I also agree with you that you shouldn't push yourself into situations that would prompt backlash and retreat.</p>
<p>We all need to find our own <em>growing edge</em>, the place where we reach into new territory. It's different for everyone. Just as trees always have their growing edge that reaches out into the unknown, we also need to keep moving on in order to stay alive and flowing. The shapes of our situations differ, the quality and pace of our growth differs — even individually, we have our fast and slow times — but we share the need to keep entering new territory.</p>
<p>There are some ways that meditation can help you, and some ways it cannot.</p>
<p>Meditation is, very basically, returning to the present moment. "Returning" means that you offer yourself to the moment and engage with it; you don't keep an analytical distance. Whatever truth arises, you sit amidst it. The posture has strength.</p>
<p>Meditation becomes more intimate with the moment, whatever it is, and whatever content it offers. There is no picking and choosing "I like this, so I'll try to get it; I don't like this, so I'll try to avoid it". None of that. So meditation is the practice of freedom. Nothing has the power to turn you away.</p>
<p>As you <em>approach</em> reality, it may feel like stepping into space — there's nothing to hang on to. But the moment you take that step you are no longer a small being stepping into something vast and unknown; you <em>are</em> the moment, and you have all knowledges and all resources. Zen Master Dogen says that "you" don't sit in meditation, meditation is the Universe sitting on the mat. You let it all be.</p>
<p>This is profoundly healing, if you approach meditation with this attitude and intent. But often our manipulating habit comes in. We try to get some particular state of mind, we try to feel a certain way, we try to make parts of ourselves work differently. That is suffering. So having a clear and simple method in meditation helps us because we have something to return to: we let go of grasping, we let go of trains of thought, and we just return to the method. That strengthens our equanimity, our ability to be with whatever arises.</p>
<p>But then you have to <em>use</em> that equanimity in real life. You have to let it out for a run regularly, or it will wither. So meditation can only go so far in helping you. If you can't use in daily life the strength, balance, and openness that meditation trains, then you may need to consult a counselor or therapist to help bring those abilities forward. There are many modern therapies that work together with meditation; and often insight into the patterns of your mind and behavior is a much bigger help than struggling on your own. Sometimes we struggle in the wrong place, when a simple change elsewhere will make all the difference.</p>
<p>There are times when we progress quickly and times when the going seem slow. When trees seem to stop their growth in the winter, they are actually still growing, but their process focuses more on conserving and building resources — almost literally setting the groundwork for future progress. We have those times as well, when we need to retreat in order to consolidate our foundation, with an eye toward future expansion.</p>
<p>This doesn't come from establishing a policy and trying to fit into it; it comes from responding to the times. So you should be careful not to think of yourself as anything in particular. Although it may be true that setting high expectations and thrusting yourself into certain situations could provoke more depression, it may also be true that you are more ready to move out than you think. What we think of ourselves is rarely very accurate, and never the complete picture. The main thing is to keep offering yourself to your present situation.</p>
<p>Keep offering yourself to your present situation, to establish the habit and train the ability to come forward and respond. Your energy moves out to meet the situation, and the situation will support you.</p>
<p>Keep offering yourself to the situation, to diminish the habits of checking and retreating. Depression is energy that doesn't move; it is kept in your own small circle. Anger is held back, sadness is avoided, love is controlled rather than flowing, self-expression is mistrusted. The energy doesn't move out to engage with the situation. This is both an effect and a cause of depression. So although you don't have to jump into high-pressure situations, you can help yourself through the willingness to open to each situation that faces you — to "be with" the moment not only in a controlled meditative form but as the day moves: waking with full intent, splashing water on your face vigorously, cooking and eating with engagement (and enjoyment is also possible!), stepping into work with a sense of purpose, letting your energy come out to meet someone, and so on.</p>
<p>The checking habit is our shared human sickness. In depression, it becomes more chronic and overblown. The search for the perfect situation and the concern about avoiding trouble and discomfort become even greater than usual, and so the mind is constantly checking and judging <em>situation</em> and <em>condition</em>. "Is this good for me or bad for me? What if it doesn't work out? I think I need more <em>such-and-such</em>. Well, if I try <em>this</em>, <em>that</em> might happen. I don't know if I'm up for it. How's my body? <em>This</em> hurts, and <em>that</em>'s not working. How's my feeling? I don't feel good....." And so on, and so on. One steps out of one's pure experience and looks back at oneself to see and name how it's going.</p>
<p>This checking habit is one of the things that meditation is supposed to help overcome, simply by the practice of letting go of thinking and returning to simple experience. You overcome it by letting go of it a million times.</p>
<p>But my concern with chakra meditation for you is that you will get into too much of a manipulative relationship with practice. Already you have checking-style thinking: "my 1,2,3,5,7 are big problems; my 4 and 6 are strong". Maybe you think you need to fix your parts before you can do anything in life. This is checking. It is depression thinking. Even if there is some accuracy to your understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, the constant looking back at yourself is not helpful. Your energy should move out into the world, not constantly be turning back to see if you're okay. You create your mindset with the way you use your mind; you create your energy pattern with the way you use your energy.</p>
<p>Does this make sense to you? I'm concerned that with chakra work you will be too manipulative, trying to tweak every little detail rather than practicing open-handed trust of yourself. There are two alternatives: either find and follow a very good teacher who is capable of overseeing all aspects of your practice (and who is qualified to deal with depression and phobias), or choose a simple method of meditation that provides no avenue for escape or "tweaking".</p>
<p>Actually, a third alternative is that you just try. Your own blind spots and habits will come into play, and you will encounter some gains and some losses, but even if you make a big mistake eventually you will discover "oh, that was a big mistake" and you will then have that bit of wisdom for yourself. Fumbling along is sometimes necessary; it's just that if you don't want to waste time, a more fitting structure (teacher and/or meditation form) is likely necessary.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So do you think my thought process is right that I can help myself with these problems by meditating?</em></p>
<p>No, in my opinion you can't help these problems only by meditating.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>or at least help enough to get me to a proper starting point do start "doing" things?</em></p>
<p>Yes, meditation can be a very excellent starting point. One of the best.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>May I ask what you do? Or how you came to know so much about all this stuff?</em></p>
<p>I don't talk much about my own situation, for a couple of reasons. First, I don't want people to take or reject what I say based on what they think I am; I want people to take or reject what I say based on their own wisdom and their testing of what I say. Does it actually work for you?</p>
<p>Second, I prefer to stay anonymous on the internet. It helps keep us on-point.</p>
<p>But I think it's reasonable that you ask, so I can talk about it a bit. I had many mystical experiences when I was young. Experiences of unity with everything, of disappearing, of overwhelming and all-encompassing love, and also some strange energetic and psychic experiences. I was a loner, and no one in my life at the time could speak to my experiences, so I had to digest them on my own.</p>
<p>At around 12 I encountered Chinese religion and philosophy — Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism — and felt that finally someone was talking about the things that I had experienced. I felt very close to the teachings of Lao Tzu and the Buddha. But these teachings were all in books, and my experience was solitary; so I had a big separation from the regular life around me: I was living up in my head and up in the sky, not with my feet on the earth. It was difficult to relate to people, and I also never learned to relate well to my body, my emotions, my fears and desires. I developed patterns of depression and neurotic behavior.</p>
<p>I had always had a meditative mind, but when I started practicing formally I made great progress in some respects but also was unaware that I was trying to control my situation (rather than letting it be). When I finally started studying with teachers I had big habits to overcome, so I had a lot of trouble and suffering in practice. Gradually, with the kind guidance of many great teachers, I started to accept myself more, accept this world more, and come out into everyday life more.</p>
<p>I've lived in many spiritual communities, mostly in Zen centers. I've also studied Chinese brushwork and movement meditation with masters. These days I teach movement for pay and meditation for free.</p>
