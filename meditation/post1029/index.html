  <h1>Daydreaming</h1>

<p>Hi. I hear that you hope to do lucid dreaming, and that you want to stop the daydreams that are overtaking you. Why?</p>
<p>Why lucid dream? For what purpose?</p>
<p>Why stop daydreams?</p>
<p>This means connecting to your true purpose, the reason you do anything in life. There are many special-looking things, many shiny objects and fancy techniques out there. Why reach toward any of them? If this point is unclear, then even something wonderful can't help you. But if this point — <em>your true purpose</em> — is clear, then you don't even need anything special; you can use your everyday life to great benefit.</p>
<p>Our correct direction, correct purpose, is to wake up from the dream of life, align with reality, and help all beings also wake up and be happy and free of suffering.</p>
<p>Originally, the whole universe just unfolds; and it has no purpose. The true state of the universe is clear, peaceful, and aware. But we live in a dream that hides the clear and peaceful nature of the universe. This dream causes great suffering, we have a purpose: to wake up from that dream, and to help others wake up from it.</p>
<p>The suffering dream or illusion is our misunderstanding of <em>self</em>. We don't understand our true self, so we make many, many very horrific problems for ourselves, each other, and the world. All evil in the world comes from this misunderstanding. So <em>that</em> is what you are to wake up to.</p>
<p>In your life you do not yet have stability of mind. Your mind wanders off uncontrolled in daydreams; and then you live in these daydreams and they affect you in real life — they cause you to lose reality, lose the chance to make good decisions and respond to things that are really going on. The daydreams also affect your thoughts and emotions, and cause you to 'do weird stuff'.</p>
<p>So you are not at all in a good state to try lucid dreaming. Without good stability of mind, messing around with your dreaming mind is dangerous and wasteful. You know how a hypnotist may plant suggestions deep in someone's mind? Well, imagine an out-of-control, daydreaming hypnotist doing that to your mind. That would be your situation. You would be going into deep levels and manipulating them without yourself having any degree of clarity, direction, or stability. I hope you see that it would be very stupid to play around with your mind this way.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons for your daydreaming. Most people — almost all people — get taken away by their thinking and daydreaming. It is wonderful that you realize it and are looking to be free of it. Some people don't even get that far!</p>
<p>There may be emotional or life situations that cause you to daydream more often or more intensely than others. If you are trying to avoid some situation or emotion, for instance, daydreaming may come up.</p>
<p>Daydreaming can also be an expression of creative energy. It is imagination, after all, and the mind's ability to visualize is at the center of all of our creativity in life: whatever is made, any creation — from houses to unique chemicals to brilliant art to communication in relationship — begins in the mind. So one point is that your daydreaming can be harnessed toward a creative purpose; and some meditations (as in Vajrayana Buddhism) make use of visualization to purify and liberate the mind.</p>
<p>The other point is that you may have some creative energy that is being stifled. If your classes or some other aspects of your life are too boring or tight, the mind may be looking for ways to be free. Intentionally engaging in creative activities like writing, art, music, acting, and play, may help calm the daydreaming.</p>
<p>Daydreaming will also sometimes be a symptom of mental or chemical imbalances. If there are no other symptoms there's no need for concern, but if you notice other disturbances of thought or mood you might want to get it checked out.</p>
<p>But sometimes daydreaming is just attachment that gets out of hand. Wanting or avoiding become indulgence, and indulgence is repeated as you let yourself go into those patterns of thinking more and more. Then the patterns seem to take on a life of their own. It seems that way, but really it has all come from you, from your own decisions about how to use your mind.</p>
<p>You make it, so you can turn it around. But if you follow distracted and indulgent thoughts a million times a day and then try mindfulness three or four times and it doesn't 'work', that's not because mindfulness is not helpful or because it's wrong, but because you haven't applied it at the level that you're applying distraction.</p>
<p>So if your thinking takes you away a million times, you have to come back a million times. Once you come back a million times, <em>then</em> you can say whether mindfulness has been helpful or not.</p>
<p>It is a common beginner's mistake to think that mindfulness or meditation will at some point switch off the thinking. No, that's not the definition of success in these practices. The thinking will continue. Especially habits that you've indulged in will continue. And very especially habits that you've added emotional intensity to will continue strongly. The success is in your returning to reality, just for a moment. Thought takes you away; you return. That is success.</p>
<p>Then thought will take you away again. That is the natural result of past causes, of the way you've used your mind in the past (even in past lives). It is natural, not 'bad'. But it takes you out of reality. So your job is to return. Just in the present moment, return. You don't need to fight to <em>keep</em> your mind here. You don't need to always be checking if it's working, or if you're doing it right. Only, when you notice that you've gone away, return quickly and without a fuss.</p>
<p>To help your returning, it's good to have a clear and accessible anchor, and object to which you can return. The body is a very good anchor, for several reasons. I especially recommend returning to the feeling of your feet on the floor (or if you're sitting, the feeling of your feet on the floor and your butt on the seat; or if you're lying down, the feeling of your body pressing against the bed or sofa). This is called awareness of your physical foundation. Whatever is at the base of your posture, whether standing, walking, sitting, or lying down, that is a very good anchor for your returning. When daydream takes you away, bring your attention to your feet and your connection to the ground. One time going away, one time returning to the feet.</p>
<p>One of the very effective aspects of this practice is that it gradually pulls the energy down out of the head and into the body where it belongs. It can also promote a more grounded feeling, a feeling that "I am here", a feeling that you have a place in life. From that place you can act with clarity and wisdom.</p>
<p>From the first glances I had of All Day Awareness, it seems not great but not terrible. It is a kind of mindfulness, but it doesn't have a clear anchor. So the attention can jump around here and there to countless different objects, promoting agitation rather than stability. It is based on a view of many separate experiences, which is a very limited view, rather than being stable within one broad unfolding. The direction of the method is also not clear. Although some aspects of ADA are not bad, I certainly wouldn't recommend it for you, as it jumps around too much; and your mind is already jumping around too much.</p>
<p>Very important for you is to let the mind be. If you try to force your mind to do or be something, that is your ego taking control rather than reality or wisdom taking control. But many people approach the mind arrogantly like this. They only increase the influence of their ego. Correct mindfulness is just to <em>return</em>; just return to reality in this moment.</p>
<p>Returning is openhanded and unknowing. It doesn't have to feel a certain way. It doesn't have to look a certain way. No special thought has to appear. As I said above, it is very plain and simple and content.</p>
<p>But one identifiable aspect of mindful returning is that you are <em>clear</em>: you can see clearly, hear clearly, taste clearly, touch clearly, smell clearly, and perceive thought clearly. When you go away in your daydream, you can't really see what's in front of you or hear what's around you. But once you realize that you've gone away, if you return (for example, by feeling the feet on the ground), then already your feeling is clear. When you return to the present moment, then what is actually in front of your face appears in your seeing consciousness rather than your dream taking over; what is actually moving around you appears in your hearing consciousness rather than your dream taking over; and so on.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is your correct direction in life: why try any method or do anything? This must be clarified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not in a good state for lucid dreaming; and lucid dreaming doesn't hold anything you don't already have. Don't mess around with your mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your mindfulness practice has to be at least equal to your daydreaming: it has to be applied just as often, and with just as much engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an anchor to return to. This will help your mind to be stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you notice that you've gone away, simply return, immediately and without making a big deal of it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>
