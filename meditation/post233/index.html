  <h1>Proper positions to sit during meditation</h1>

<p>Posture has effects on many levels. It is clear that posture and mental state condition each other. When you are depressed, you sink and hunch; when you are fearful, your shoulders rise and your muscles tense; when you are alert, the torso becomes upright. It works the other way around as well, as sinking and hunching promote depression, and so on.</p>
<p>Besides the pyschosomatic connection, the reasons for adopting certain meditation postures include facilitation of flow of energy in specific patterns. The building and circulation of energy in ways that promote concentrated awareness can be either supported or hindered depending on the posture you take. The orbit of energy around the center line of the body corresponds somewhat to the development of effortless concentration — the first "substance" of awakened mind. The connection of right and left pathways helps balance and equalize the two-sided nature of the brain and mind (for example, active and passive, or distinction-making and free-flowing).</p>
<p>Further issues impacted by posture range from psychological to utilitarian. In meditation, one practices relying on one's own mind power rather than on external supports, and so sitting upright without back support and arm rests may play a part in one's practice. The attainment and expression of relaxation, awareness, and nobility are also reflected in and embodied by relaxed, upright, and noble posture.</p>
<p>Some teachers seem willing to encourage students to disregard pain and possible bodily damage. Some portion of these teachers may give lip service to going at your own pace or taking care of yourself, but when it comes down to it they offer few options for actually relieving damaging stresses on the structure of the body. I tend to believe that freeing yourself from attachment to the body doesn't have to mean that the body gets brutalized. With strong aspiration and a detailed awareness of the gross and subtle influences of various postures, you can find healthy alternatives.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although posture may help or hinder meditation quite a bit, <em>mind is primary</em>. That is to say, with a devoted heart and well focused mind, any posture is viable, even lying down. It is just that lying down or resting back in an easy chair make it much more difficult to maintain sharp awareness. (People who think it is possible have always, in my experience, actually been drifting in semi-dream states without realizing it.)</p>
<p>Sitting on a chair is a good alternative, and especially until your knee is strong enough for sitting on a mat again. The chair should be stable, and should allow you to sit comfortably upright at the front edge of the seat. The feet should be flat on the floor, and the legs should not have to be held up with muscular effort. The hips should be able to find their upright balance without muscular effort — the triangular sit bones in a vertical alignment, and the lower back self-supporting, neither collapsed backward nor pushed forward. This hip/lower back configuration is the same as if you were sitting on a mat. Some say that the lower back should be pushed slightly forward, but that is a bit misleading. In some people, a balanced upright hip alignment forms a fairly flat back; in others, the back appears slightly curved. The important point is that the hips are balanced and the spine's <em>natural</em> curvature can support itself without struggle, not that the lower back curve should be artificially imposed.</p>
<p>If your chair is unstable, find a stable one. If it is stable enough when you are sitting still, that may be enough; but my sense is that there will always be an unconscious anxiety, a lack of reliability in your physical foundation. That may turn out to be a significant drawback, as confidence in your physical foundation refers somewhat to confidence in your mind's foundation which allows you to let go completely and merge with your practice.</p>
<p>Sitting on a mat may also be possible for you with more (firm) cushions under your bottom, and/or possible a supporting cushion under your knee. Ideally your knees should rest firmly on the mat, providing a strong triangular base between your knees and seat. If the legs are not flexible enough to sit that way, a temporary support under one or both knees may help prevent injury and may help the legs to relax enough to begin to stretch over time, until such a time as the supports aren't needed any more.</p>
<p>With any cushion supports, you should gradually try to do away with them, until you are able to sit comfortably on a bare mat.</p>
<p>Tiredness or weakness in the back is usually addressed somewhat simply by more practice. You do it until you are better able to do it. Self-reliance is highly prized. "Be a lamp unto yourself." But many meditators reach plateaus beyond which they can't seem to venture. Some extra physical training can then be very helpful. Yoga, Pilates, and other programs of core and posture strengthening combined with reasonable flexibility training can help one sit more comfortably for longer periods. The supporting muscles around the waist should be strengthened, along with the muscles that bring the shoulder blades back and down, and the muscles that lengthen the neck and bring the chin back and down. Any flexibility work should go hand-in-hand with strengthening, to provide the muscle tone that keeps joints properly aligned.</p>
<p>Legs often fall asleep because of pressure on the nerves at the back of the thighs. This may be alleviated by moving forward on your cushion or on the edge of the chair, so that the thighs are no longer being pressed and the sit bones and butt are taking the brunt of the pressure. Some experienced meditators find that the legs fall asleep less over time; others continue to experience it, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The most remarkable revelation may come for you by focusing completely on the method. Once you have arranged your body somewhat reasonably, let no other thought enter besides your devotion to the method of meditation. When you reach one-pointedness, where you merge with the method, the power of concentration will almost surely (and seemingly magically) provide a support and energetic circulation and comfort that was not possible from mere physical arrangement. It is as if a flat tire were repaired and re-inflated; the power of concentration fills you up and takes on the posture for you. To get this far, it is necessary to stop seeking the perfect situation, and rather to seek your best relationship with (your best acceptance of) whatever the current situation holds.</p>
