  <h1>How to meditate through a dark place?</h1>

<p>I'm sorry for your pain. Take care to communicate, and not to make assumptions. Communication can resolve most relationship problems.</p>
<p>A practice that someone passed on to me a long time ago when I was also in relationship hell: When you're in turmoil with someone, it's as if the connection reaches into you and turns your stomach. Every time you think of the other person or of the problem, feel that stomach-turning connection, and let go of it. It doesn't mean driving the person away, it means you are both left to your own true lives, without undue attachment. This letting-go practice helped me stay more balanced and sane.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>When the meditation practice is strong (we say "when your center is strong"), then these kinds of experiences won't necessarily disturb you. Or they will disturb you in the moment, and then you can return.</p>
<p>There are two general pieces of advice, which key on what kind of container or support system you have for your practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>When the practice (or "center") is not yet at that level, some situations will be overwhelming. Overthinking will happen, and it will be difficult to extricate yourself. <strong>Within a strong container, you can just continue sitting in meditation and facing the situation head-on:</strong> just continue applying yourself to the method and dropping other concerns. Moment to moment, drop the engagement with the significant other and return to your method of practice. This is the same approach, no matter how things are going â€” good or bad or neutral, the outside situation doesn't make any difference. Only keep putting it down and returning, ten thousand times, a million times.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to put it down and return will become stronger and stronger. That becomes your strong center. It may move briefly, but you can quickly return. Then you have independence, and you don't rely on things that you like and you don't get thrown off by things that you don't like.</p>
<p>If you have a strong container, then this is possible. "Strong container" means that your habit of practice â€” your personal meditation schedule â€” is quite strong, or you have a good support system â€” a good environment and lifestyle that supports frequent return to wholesome mind; a good teacher overseeing your practice; a community of spiritual friends and meditators who keep you on-track.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the container is not ideal, and in any case as a way to help yourself, physical activity and work are excellent influences. As you've already discovered, <strong>getting into the body can help the mind settle.</strong> So whether it's working out at the gym or doing some other kind of physical activity, just letting the body's activity be more prominent can help.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We say that the mind "comes down". When you're over-thinking, your energy and focus are up high, in the head. That is a configuration that is easily unbalanced, as if your center of gravity were moved upward. You are easily moved around by your thoughts.</p>
<p>When the energy comes down lower into the body, thoughts may appear but they don't throw you off as much; and eventually the thoughts themselves settle down.</p>
<p><strong>The best activity for settling the thinking mind is activity that engages the whole body, the breath, the mind, and the heart all together.</strong> Not only are you fully engaged, all of the parts of your being can come together in greater harmony, in integrity. By its very nature that is healing. So bringing intention and devotion in to a whole body-and-breath movement is most beneficial. This may mean doing regular <strong>rhythmic exercise</strong> like walking, running, bicycling, x-country skiing, swimming, or rowing with a mindful and heartful attitude.</p>
<p>But two activities stand out as exceptional ways to integrate the being and bring the thinking energy down:</p>
<p>First, <strong>bowing full prostrations</strong> is an excellent practice that has been taught in many spiritual traditions. In many cases, it is considered a sort of emergency method that works even when the mind is too disturbed to do anything else. But it is also an important and excellent part of training even when things are going well and sitting meditation is possible. Because it brings the thinking energy down so effectively, it is an excellent partner practice to sitting meditation.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>free dance</strong> embraces (or <em>can</em> embrace) all of the levels of self â€” body, heart, mind, spirit â€” and has the added benefit of tapping in to your spontaneous wisdom. As you free the bodymind to move as it wants to move, it arranges itself according to its best healing pathways. Instead of thinking of a plan and forcing it on yourself, you follow the impulses that arise to move and express, and the innate wisdom of the bodymind will arrange its own healing. This may mean simply moving, or it may become a furious dance that cleans you out, or it may become a lighthearted letting go, or any of infinite other possibilities.</p>
<p>Usually, getting out of the head and into the body is most helpful, but if you find that a necessary first step is to <strong>express your thoughts and emotions</strong>, then journaling or creating some art or music may help. Whatever helps you to keep the thing moving through you rather than getting stuck in a holding pattern. Just so long as your activity doesn't hurt yourself or others.</p>
<p>Best wishes, for you and all of us.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/12spgq/legs_falling_asleep_while_meditating_any_good_tips/c6xz3ie">Information on bowing practice here in a previous post.</a></p>
<p>For times when the mind is too agitated to do sitting meditation, and when bowing or other physical practice is not possible, mantra and chanting are also helpful. <strong>Mantra</strong> literally means "mind protection"; it can protect your mind from those disturbing influences if you devote yourself to it continuously throughout the day. Choose a short, easy-to-repeat mantra and keep it going as you proceed through your daily activity. It will give you something to return to when thoughts threaten to pull you away into hell.</p>
<p><strong>Chanting</strong> has the added benefit of the engagement of voice and breath. That helps you get into it more. The more mental agitation is a problem, the faster you can chant. Even beyond sitting down for a chanting session, just using the singing voice can quickly help to settle and heal the emotions. Chanting and singing tend to be more connected to the activity of the emotional heart.</p>
