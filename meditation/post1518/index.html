  <h1>too all you mediators, can you explain different ways to meditate and to be spiritual. and what were your experiences like?</h1>

<p>It's wonderful that this is your interest.</p>
<p>Life's dream is made by thinking. Thinking separates things; it applies a limited, unchanging label to something that is connected to everything and is always changing. So words and concepts are only short-form pointers. But we mistake our words and concepts for the real thing.</p>
<p>When we say "car" we assume that we know what that is, just because we use the word. We don't see that the car comes from everywhere. The metal and rubber and plastics and oils come from the earth and oceans, and before that from the galaxy. The electrical and gasoline energy comes from the sun. The form that these parts are gathered in comes from the ideas and work of many hundreds of thousands of people. The places where all of these parts are processed and the people who make it all happen are supported and sustained by countless other beings. So "car" comes from everywhere.</p>
<p>Also, "car" is always changing. Parts are rotating and pumping, new explosions in the engine, new gasoline going inside and being transformed into travel, parts wearing down and being replaced.... Even at a molecular level, particles and energy are constantly being exchanged with the environment. And what we understand as "my car" is always changing in terms of our experience of it, the difference in our relationship to it.</p>
<p>Every <em>thing</em> is like this, made of everything else and always changing. But because we mistake words and concepts for real life, we imagine we live in a world of separate unchanging objects.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more deeply believed and more deeply significant than in our own selves. We make this same mistake about ourselves, thinking ourselves to be something separate and stable rather than perceiving that we come from everything and are constantly changing. Our whole illusory world originates from this mistake.</p>
<p>So this is our dream.</p>
<p>There are several meditative paths that aim at waking up and seeing the true nature of things; but one very directly focused meditation is <em>self-inquiry</em>. Since the central illusion — the dream that is filtering all experience — is the illusion of being a separate self, this is the meditation that gets to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>In this meditation, you try to find the self. At some point, it is discovered that the self can't be found anywhere you look. When you reache that point, you rest in that open space until by itself it blossoms into realization of the true nature of things — waking up.</p>
<p>Anything that you can point to is not <em>you</em>. You have "my" body and <em>my</em> thoughts and <em>my</em> feelings, just as you have <em>my</em> house and <em>my</em> wallet and <em>my</em> phone. Also, <em>my</em> family, <em>my</em> relationships, <em>my</em> world, <em>my</em> life. All of those things are "my", so they belong to or are experienced by you, but are not you. So what is the thing that experiences all of those things? What is behind the eyes and ears and sensations and feelings? For whom are thoughts appearing? What is it that gains or loses anything?</p>
<p>In self-inquiry meditation, you are seeking this thing behind your experience. If all things and experiences in life are the objects, where is the subject?</p>
<p>It is not that you seek it through thinking. You don't ask yourself the question and try to figure out a logical concept. You actually go looking for the self.</p>
<p>This can be done either by just resting and looking inward, trying to see the self directly, or by using experiences to trace back to the self. For instance, when a sound appears, you may look into "who is hearing this sound?" Or "where does this sound appear?" Any thought or concept that arises is rejected as mere thought, not the real thing. When you hear something, you have the notion that "I" am hearing this. That means that there must be some connection between the sound and the "I". So you trace the sound backward toward yourself and try to find the center of your experience, the one who is witnessing it.</p>
<p>Soon you will find that there is nothing to be found. You will reach a stuck point, because you can't jump outside of yourself to look back at yourself. It's similar to not being able to see your own eyeball unless you have a mirror, because your eye is the thing that is looking; it can't look at itself. Similarly, when you go looking for yourself you will find that you can't actually get a glimpse of yourself, you can only <em>be</em> the witness. When you get to this point, just be the witness.</p>
<p>The first part of this meditation, the seeking your self, is important. It is important to try, to search for the one at the center of your experience. But when you reach the point where it's clear there's no way to grasp yourself, then you just rest as the witness.</p>
<p>To repeat: follow your experience back to yourself, tracing sound or sensation or thought back to the one experiencing it. You will sooner or later come to a stuck or still place; and so you just rest there. If more thoughts come up, you again try to trace them back: "Who is thinking this thought?" "Where is the place where this thought first appears?" You will not find anything to hold on to; there will just be an unthinking sense of "don't know", being speechless and at a loss. We may call this "unknowing". Rest in that unknowing.</p>
<p>That stuck or still place that we refer to as "unknowing" is your awake mind, your original mind before thoughts make an illusory world on top of it. If you rest there, then it will blossom into full awakening. This will take many, many repetitions of trying to find the self and then resting in the unknowing that appears. Give up any sense of getting somewhere or getting something, don't think about time and progress; only carry out the practice purely and endlessly.</p>
<p>When practicing this self-inquiry meditation, it may help to consider that you are not your body. Your body is a gathering of substances and shapes that are always changing in their relationship with each other and with the environment. Your body has certainly changed since you were born, and it will continue to change. Your body is "yours" but it is not you. You are not your body.</p>
<p>Also, if you say you are your mind, then you must know that it is not just the <em>word</em> or <em>idea</em> of mind where your self can be found.</p>
<p>So you are not your body, and you are not the word or idea of mind. Then seek the real mind, the awareness at the center of your experience at any moment. This can (and in due course should) be practiced not only during sitting meditation, but moment to moment, non-stop, throughout every activity. All of life is brought back to the center: "Where am I?" "Who is experiencing this?" You thinking will come down and settle, and will not get in the way (as much) of clear perception. Your waking up will grow, and if you make a great effort it will become a great waking up.</p>
