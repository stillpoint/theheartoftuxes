  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Like I said, those "wandering" thoughts are not just being meaningless. They have their purpose and in a sense tell us more than our conscious thoughts do.</em></p>
<p>This is more of a western psychological slant, looking for meaning as one might do in dream interpretation and free-association or art therapy. Searching for psychological information and meaning is not the main aim of most Buddhist or other East Asian meditative traditions. <em>Liberation</em> from thought, seeing the essential nature of thought, attaining the still basis of mind, or embodying awakened Buddha-nature are more common aims.</p>
<p>Knowing that the self and its stories are originally empty and illusory, we can recognize <em>all</em> thought as meaningless. From this perspective, there is no such thing as inferior or superior thought; there is only the practice of freedom from thought altogether, to see clearly.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>So instead of ignoring mind wanderings it's best to focus on all the mind wanderings and take note of them because their telling a bigger story.</em></p>
<p>This is considered a shallow aim, at best, in most eastern meditative traditions. We are not concerned with story, and we certainly are not to get <em>wrapped up</em> in story. This is completely contrary to the thrust of most meditation. What you describe is called "object consciousness" -- attaching to the objects that appear in the mind rather than being centered in clear mind itself. It's like the difference between being caught up in the drama of a movie, on one hand, or perceiving the screen and projections and realizing it's just a movie, on the other hand.</p>
<p>What you call "a bigger story" is not very big. It's still involved with object consciousness: an 'I' sifting through thought objects. This kind of practice never can liberate one from the subject-object delusion.</p>
<p>The real bigger story is no story: the basis of mind itself. This is what Zen is primarily concerned with.</p>
<p>In any case, you can't say "best"; you can only say that it's one way you know of or consider.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You may have some confusion about common meditation instructions. It often happens when one takes in a mish-mosh of information from various sources without any consistency or organizing principle.</p>
<p>Simple instructions may call one to "cut off thinking" or "make the mind still". Without following up and receiving proper teaching, some people interpret this to mean pushing away thoughts; i.e., that one should not be aware of any thought whatsoever.</p>
<p>So the next instruction, the cure to that misunderstanding, becomes "don't try to push away distracting thoughts". But then, again, without following through with proper teaching people can misunderstand this to mean that meandering thought is somehow to be courted. This seems to be your view. This is also not meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation means keeping an unmoving mind, regardless of whether thoughts appear or don't appear. There may be silence or there may be mental activity, <em>but one neither goes toward nor away from any object</em>. It is like watching a playground from morning to night without moving: first there is no activity, then there is activity, then there is no activity; but in all cases, you sit still without moving.</p>
<p>What you are describing is <em>moving</em> mind: actually getting up and engaging with the activity, and making more activity, and labeling the activity, and taking notes about the activity. That's a completely different process.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>For example: Let's say your trying to concentrate on something but intrusive thoughts keep interrupting your meditation, the best thing to do instead of fighting against it is to let the thought come through and let it go, taking note of what was being said.</em></p>
<p>You can't say this is the 'best' thing to do; you can only say this is one approach. 'Noting' in this way isn't used much in Zen. It tends to be part of some Theravada mindfulness approaches; and even then is not adopted or recommended across the board, only in specific schools.</p>
<p>Even in schools that adopt noting, it is usually used (partly) as a skillful way of letting go and disengaging from thought objects and other experiences. To <em>perceive</em> them, but not get caught up in them.</p>
<p>Occasionally, noting will be used as a method of mindfulness, to identify mental states or to practice ethical activity. Again, it is not that analytic; one doesn't generate more story, more thoughts about patterns and such. That would be more of a self-analysis/psychological approach, and nowhere near as deep as true meditation (because it still engages at a level of an assumed self).</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If you do this over an entire session yo'll notice that the intrusive thoughts have a general theme (usually stuff you're subconsciously worried about) which should be the actual thing in which you should be focused on.</em></p>
<p>Noting themes isn't a Zen approach; it's wrong and misleading to call it Zen.</p>
<p>You also can't dramatically state that identifying a theme "<em>should</em> be the actual thing in which you should be focused on" (sic), because (A) you are not necessarily qualified to distinguish liberative themes from useless themes, and (B) it often amounts to more attachment to story, thought, and self.</p>
<p>In any case, even if performed in a useful manner with respect to garnering psychological insights, it certainly has nothing to do with Zen practice.</p>
