  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>There's no 'getting it right'; there's trying again, and doing your best.</p>
<p>Meditation means we offer space, clear space. When that clear space is offered, without all kinds of agendas and activities filling it, the material in our being that has been suppressed or controlled starts to loosen and find its flow, often coming to the surface of our awareness. It's not new material, it doesn't come from the outside; it's just that we start to become aware of it as it moves out.</p>
<p>It's good that this material moves (movement is life), and good that it moves out. But if the meditator hasn't developed stability and detachment it can disturb them. That is, rather than being openhanded and allowing things to move as they need to move, the attaching habit clings to the material (in your case, 'bad' dreams) and makes stories about it — labeling it bad, making trains of thought that say something has to be done about it, and fretting about what will happen next. Thus, instead of merely clearing out old issues one also creates new issues.</p>
<p>There are two basic approaches that come to mind (perhaps there are other ways some experts can chime in on): develop the practice so the mind becomes stable and smooth, not moved by these kinds of events. It's not that the events no longer happen — they may happen for a while and then gradually settle — but that one doesn't attach to them and make trouble for oneself. It's also not the case that one is <em>never</em> moved, never disturbed; but one can become better at re-setting, coming back to neutral very quickly.</p>
<p>The second approach is to change to a form of practice that doesn't bring you in such close contact with the thinking mind. This includes physical practice, some mantra and chanting, and 'karma yoga' (work/activity practice — doing good and compassionate activity). Often practitioners find that practices like <em>Metta</em> (and other <em>Brahmavihara</em> practices, as well as <em>Tonglen</em> compassion-visualization) also protect against too much self-involvement with thinking and dreaming. This makes sense because the practices radiate outward strongly rather than becoming self-involved in a cramped little circle.</p>
<p>Physical practice is a very effective form, both in and of itself and as a companion to sitting. It tends to be underrepresented in pop culture representations of meditation, online, and in books; but in traditional courses of training physical practice is highly respected as a very fast way to settle and center the mind.</p>
<p>I agree that you should find one source and course of training and stick to it. There are many reasons for this, but basically you are working to reduce confusion and misunderstanding, and maximize the penetration of teaching. We usually need to receive a teaching a thousand times or more before it sinks in below our habitual way of viewing life. If different teachings are competing for our attention, or if the same words are being used in different ways by different teachers, learning progresses more slowly.</p>
<p>New students, especially in this day and age of data and virtual reality, tend to assume that learning means gathering knowledge, amassing concepts. Although <em>some</em> concepts are necessary, by far the greater part of learning is <em>doing</em>. So learning one good way and getting to the task of <em>doing</em> it is the hallmark of most successful students.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt; <em>How real are the bad dreams in actual practice?</em></p>
<p>The dreams are not real; they are just mental projections.</p>
<p>With practice and proper teaching you can realize that <em>all</em> appearances in life are not real, and are just mental projections. None of it has to have the power to control your mood and intent.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Is it really that common?</em></p>
<p>Comparing is not a fruitful practice. What we can say is that diversity is the rule: there are 84,000 kinds of mind and there are 84,000 categories of events that arise in the mind and 84,000 teachings that address those events. So there are many different things that can arise, some weird and some boring and some neither here nor there. That's about the only thing you can count on. Whether it's common doesn't mean anything; it's all 'normal'.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more pertinent question is whether <em>you</em> are normal with what's going on — how much does it disturb you and throw you off?</p>
<p>&gt; <em>I've read in many places that I should find one set of instructions and stick to it. Could someone direct me to one such set?</em></p>
<p>There are so very many methods available, including good, so-so, and bad ones. To recommend one without knowing you would be arbitrary. People can recommend a method that seems to be effective for a great many people (like one of the methods of following the breath); but even at that, there is a large portion of people who have various difficulties with it.</p>
<p>From what you've written, I might tend to recommend a physical practice. Are you interested in walking meditation? Or perhaps prostrations?</p>
<p>&gt; <em>...from what I gather metta and breath meditation should go side by side. ...is there a guide for noobs how to do both metta and mindfulness right that I can stick to?</em></p>
<p>In some traditional courses of training, such as Theravada Buddhism, <em>Metta</em> and breath training are both trained, along with many other parts of life such as ethical behavior and self-care. Other traditions incorporate compassion in different ways.</p>
<p>Metta itself includes concentration, and if you practice it while going about your day it also trains mindfulness, so depending on your aim it is quite fine and beneficial to do Metta practice alone.</p>
<p>Be careful about equating your own sense of well being with success in practice. First of all, it's not only about you, which is especially apparent in Metta practice, which offers well being to all — infinitely, boundlessly, in all realms and directions. Secondly, you are not necessarily the best judge of well being. Merely feeling good can be deceptive, as people tend to attach to feeling rather than honoring spacious non-attachment. Thirdly, many qualities develop unseen for quite some time, and the true results only emerge further down the road; so many good things can be happening without you necessarily being aware of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.diydharma.org/metta-meditation-sharon-salzberg">Here's an excellent mp3 on Metta meditation with Sharon Salzberg,</a> who I recommend.</p>
<p>Here she is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mindpodnetwork/sharon-salzberg-metta-hour-episode-02-meditation">on Soundhound.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/audio-meditation.htm">This page has many talks,</a> including guided Metta meditations with Ven. Pannyavaro and Malcolm Huxter , and a longer talk with Sharon Salzberg that I believe includes guided meditation.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>This previous post and the thread that follows it looks at mental projections. You may find it useful.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here's a simple, adaptable mindfulness practice that can be used with walking or in fact in any body posture (excerpted from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/42o7cv/canshould_you_be_mindful_while_doing_activities/czc2idx">this previous post</a>):</p>
<p>&gt; I recommend <strong>awareness of your physical base</strong>. It provides a clear object to return to, and it can function in the background of other activities without intruding. The physicality keeps you in contact with the broader scene, and has the great benefit of grounding you in the body, which balances our modern tendency to live up in the head. (This will be especially valuable for those who work sedentary jobs and use electronic 'thinking machines' much of the time.)</p>
<p>&gt; In this practice, you maintain a <em>background</em> awareness of your physical contact with support: when standing or walking you feel your feet on the ground; when sitting you feel your feet on the floor and butt and arms contacting the chair; when lying or reclining you feel your body's connection with the bed, sofa, or floor. (When swimming, you feel the support of the water all around you.)</p>
<p>&gt; This is easy to return to. Gravity helps you. When you are tense you can use the practice to release the tension down into the earth. The practice provides a settled, rooted quality to your mind and heart. It doesn't interfere with most (if any) activities. And it can go on in the background. (Just to give a feel for it we could say it uses, say, 5% - 30% of your attention.)</p>
<p>&gt; And at times when you want to practice a more focused concentration-style practice, it can easily shift to one-pointed attention at the feet (80%), as in some traditional walking meditations.</p>
