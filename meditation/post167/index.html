  <h1>With meditation, can you weed out the bad/envious thoughts? Or bad thoughts in general?</h1>

<p>You absolutely <em>can</em> get better at being unmoved by your thinking. The thinking will still arise, since it is rooted in countless past causes; but you can practice not attaching to the thoughts that arise. That is meditation: keeping a mind that doesn't move, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>As you practice, you can get better and better at disengaging from the thoughts rather than following them or letting them toss you about like a ship in a storm. This ability to disengage and show up open-handed is sometimes referred to as "center". The more you practice returning to openhandedness or unknowing, the stronger your center becomes. Not only will it take more to throw you off balance, you will be able to return to equilibrium more quickly.</p>
<p>As the patterns of thinking and relating rooted in past causes arise, if you avoid creating <em>new</em> causes then gradually the patterns will disperse, lose their hold, and clear away. But this is not the same thing as having no emotion or having flat affect. Don't make that assumption! People who are clear have clear emotion, not no emotion.</p>
<p>If you have the chance to meet some high-class meditators, you will likely find them to be <em>more</em> flexible, <em>more</em> responsive, <em>more</em> engaging rather than depressive and aloof.</p>
<p>Also, to say "I don't really care" is only accurate on a surface level. The truth is that you do care very much, or you wouldn't be holding yourself back from feeling certain things. If you truly didn't care, then you would be okay facing everything with equal presence. So <em>real</em> not-caring is necessary; you have to become wild like a wide-open landscape, ready to receive bright days and dark days, calmness and storm.</p>
<p>When you are present and open, everything is just truth. It is when you are thinking that "good" and "bad" arise. Because "good" and "bad" arise, you try to make your own comfortable situation and so you stop receiving, stop moving. The cure is to allow movement again.</p>
<p>Of course, it needs to be said in these forums that meditation can't do everything for you. If you need therapeutic help, you should seek it out, just as you should cook or go to a restaurant if you are hungry — meditation won't put food in your mouth either.</p>
<p>Meditation can be very helpful for depression if it is performed properly, and that means having a non-grasping, open-handed attitude. Correct meditation doesn't seek special feeling or situation, and doesn't avoid anything. Since correct meditation allows your mind and heart to move freely, within the full light of your awareness, it directly undercuts depression, which is the suppression and avoidance of feeling.</p>
<p>But incorrect meditation can often become part of the depressive strategy, to keep things under wraps. The habit of avoiding one's feeling and controlling one's internal situation can co-opt meditation into a tool for self-manipulation. Focusing on the object of meditation (say, counting the breath) can become a pursuit of a certain concentrated mind-state, or an escape from tenderness and vulnerability; the meditator escapes into the object of meditation.</p>
<p>So it is very important to have a natural, open, non-grasping attitude in meditation. <em>Everything</em> can be present. When one first considers this it might seem scary; but the moment it is embodied it becomes <em>okay</em>. It is the expression of your original mind, which is always okay. Every situation, every thought, every feeling is no problem.</p>
<p>Getting physical can help tremendously with finding that natural and open attitude. In most traditional systems, physical training is the first training. When the body has been moving and exerting itself, emotions and thoughts tend to smooth out. The body has such a great grounding faculty; when you are active and "in the body", you can get "out of your head" and out of those suffering cycles of thinking.</p>
<p>Just putting the emphasis on action rather than thinking can be a life-changing difference. Actually tasting and smelling and feeling and doing, instead of <em>thinking</em> about how to live, can bring about more real engagement (with joy and sadness and fear and fun all becoming more alive).</p>
<p>There are also many kinds of physical activities that are helpful for getting out of the head and into the body. But in my experience, two practices rise head and shoulders above the rest: bowing practice and free dance. Bowing practice has many ideal qualities for your situation: the whole body, breath, heart, and mind can be involved; it is simple and rhythmic; and most of all, it quickly brings the energy down out of the head (out of the thinking). Free dance also uses and harmonizes every aspect of self, but furthermore it allows for perhaps the most direct and complete expression of emotion: whatever appears in the heart can be seamlessly expressed in movement.</p>
<p>It is clear that you already know you don't have to participate in envy or bitterness. But it's not that you necessarily clear it away once and for all. Practice is simple and momentary. This moment, you're either present in life or you're lost in unreality. Moment to moment, the choice is yours as to what direction you're travelling: envy or letting go of envy; dejection or letting go of dejection.</p>
<p>Never mind the results; they will take care of themselves. Be satisfied with the direction; be satisfied with just *doing * it this moment.</p>
