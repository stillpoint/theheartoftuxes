  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>At first it's important to establish a good basis, a good relationship with practice. So in your first attempts you can go easy and follow your good feeling.</p>
<p>When you become relaxed with the process and learn the method, you will start to experience benefits. Enjoy those benefits; take some moments after meditation to appreciate the clarity and peace, thank yourself for your good effort, and receive the blessings that come your way. These experiences sink into your mind and create positive associations that help you return to meditation and continue on a positive path.</p>
<p>In the early stages, pushing often leads to dropping out.</p>
<p>But once you have developed a taste for meditation and know its benefits more deeply, then you can take gradual steps to making your practice more profound and transformative. At first, it was just about temporary good feeling; but it <em>can</em> be something that actually changes your life completely.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you ever hope to be free of your own habits you will have to establish a practice that goes beyond habit. That means sitting whether you feel like it or not. Once you're ready to commit to that level of practice, you just do it, without question. This goes beyond your 'like' and 'dislike'; and thus you embody freedom. You prove to yourself that you can do beneficial action regardless of defeatist or lazy patterns; you can return to peace regardless of anxiety or anger. This is a more mature form of practice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in progressing in meditation (as opposed to just doing it for temporary good feeling), it would be very helpful to have a live teacher and practice group. We may need to hear good teaching ten thousand times before it actually sinks in; and receiving that good teaching consistently, not mixed with all kinds of other suggestions and opinions, is extremely valuable. And having a group and practice schedule help you go beyond your own habit-mind. You put down the things that would otherwise keep you from practicing, and show up â€” in part out of the kindness to support others in their practice, and in part out of pride so you're not seen slacking off. (This is a skillful use of an emotion that otherwise can be a hindrance.)</p>
<p>When you are meditating, it is just about <em>now</em>, just about the moment. It is not about what happened before. What happened in a previous sitting has already gone. It is no longer real; it only lives in your thinking. Don't confuse your thinking with present-moment reality. Just attend to this moment with your meditation method.</p>
<p>That means you must not compare between past and present; and you must not compare between what you see or hear of others and what is happening for you. Be independent in this way, taking care of your own situation, your own truth.</p>
<p>You must also not step out of your practice to check, label, and judge what is happening to you. Don't try to apply thoughts or labels to your experience. Don't try to measure it or see if there's precedent for it. Don't think of your experience as anything special. Don't be joyful when it's easy or sad when it's difficult. That is all illusion. Just take care of the moment.</p>
<p>Where joy comes in is joy for your sincerity and your effort toward clarity. It doesn't matter what the feeling is like. What matters is that you are alive, awake, attentive.</p>
<p>Life is always changing. You can never hold on to something. You gain and you lose, always. You are up, then you are down. Don't let these changes kidnap your mind. Only be present with your method.</p>
<p>Distraction is no problem. Don't check distraction. Only return. When you are distracted, return to the present moment through your method. If you check distraction it will only create more thoughts and distractions. Also, if you check feeling it will only create more thoughts and distractions. Don't check; only return through your method.</p>
<p>Likewise, don't check "am I ready... am I not ready... how ready am I... how nice will this be... will this be uncomfortable... what can I expect... how well will I do... how well <em>did</em> I do...?" This is all checking, and all to be thrown away in the garbage. Never mind! Only do the practice. If you follow your checking mind, you will never, ever be free of it. Checking will always control your action, and you will be a slave to your thoughts.</p>
<p>Rather than thinking of 'forcing' yourself, maybe develop skill in <em>inviting</em> yourself to do something that â€” in your clearer moments â€” you know is beneficial for your life and happiness.</p>
<p>Even when you <em>just sit no matter what</em>, leave behind any sense of forcing. Only do it, the same way you go to the washroom when you need to, or the way you have breakfast in the morning, or the way you pick up something you dropped. You don't make a drama: "Dammit! Now I have to force myself to pick up that sock!" No, you just do it; and then it's done. You move on.</p>
<p>Meditation should have no attachment, no grasping. In the first sittings you try, you can focus on relaxing and enjoying, and develop a good relaxed association with meditation; but that doesn't mean that meditation is about getting good feeling. It's about applying your relaxed presence in every situation. It's not necessary to have a particular feeling or situation. So you should have no grasping or chasing when you meditate. If you try to get and hold a particular feeling or state of mind, that is the kind of forcing that creates problems. It negatively affects your mind and your body, and it destroys the aim of practice.</p>
<p>Cultivate openhanded, relaxed presence. Moment to moment, relax with the moment. Don't fall asleep; just relax. If you get distracted, don't generate a drama about it; only return to the method.</p>
