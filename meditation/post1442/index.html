  <h1>How to deal with "sinking mind"?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>It's a shame if that condition is a near-direct blockage to advance.</em></p>
<p>What is 'advance'?</p>
<p>You shouldn't confuse the fact that you have difficulty, or that you are not in your favorite state, with failure. The advance is not that you always have your favorite situation. The advance is that you keep moving forward and clarifying your path regardless of the situations that arise: you allow no situation the power to turn you from your goal.</p>
<p>Some of the things you are experiencing are actually close to Dharma. Not caring is a negative mind state, but very close to it is the positive and Dharmic attitude of equanimity -- staying even-minded among ups and downs. Dullness is a negative mind state, but very close to it is the Dharmic essence of emptiness, in which nothing has a substantial existence.</p>
<p>It is said that the Dharma has no flavor. You shouldn't expect something spectacular or even something sweet. The emptiness behind everything is flavorless. So your experiences are not far off, if you keep applying yourself.</p>
<p>Your motivation is vague, so that contributes to unclarity in meditation. It's neither bad nor uncommon; it just means you need to clarify your direction, the reason you meditate, the purpose for which you do anything in life. Knowing your life direction clearly and deeply is an all-important basis for all the practice you may undertake in the future.</p>
<p>It's not something that gets clarified in one go. You have to keep coming back to the question: â€œWhy do this, and not something else? What is my life for?" When your direction is clear it will exert a stabilizing force on the mind in meditation, and will let you identify more quickly when you wander off (and indeed will let you know what constitutes wandering off).</p>
<p>There are three levels of positive motivation for practice. The lowest level is to get some better qualities and improve your life. This lowest level is what you are currently aiming at by seeking to know more and be more sensitive. It is a valid basis for practicing meditation and other Dharmic practices.</p>
<p>Mid-level motivation is to get enlightenment -- to completely wake up from life's illusion, without ever falling back into ignorance and suffering.</p>
<p>High level motivation is something many people don't even imagine until it's shown to them or until they witness a living example of it; and that is the motivation to bring all beings, everywhere, to complete enlightenment. This motivation is complete compassion, without seeking something to keep for oneself (because, after all, the bottom of 'self' and the notion of 'having'something are both illusions). When this Great motivation is clear and sincere, it infuses all practice and all life with clarity and vitality: there is little room left for doubt about what to do and how to do it.</p>
<p>After motivation, we look at method. We still don't know what method you are using and how you apply it. How do you keep your body and mind during sittings? How clear is the practice schedule, how is the duration of meditation regulated? What do you do when the mind wanders? In short, are you very clear on the method and the intended aim of the method; and are you applying the method very meticulously? This will also make a big difference in your wakefulness.</p>
<p>After motivation and method have been investigated and made clear, we may look at underlying patterns. To a large extent, if you are doing correct practice you should just continue, and let your practice resolve any obstacle that may arise. Just doing it is an expression of faith that empowers you.</p>
<p>You say that you have encountered many things with acceptance during meditation. That is wonderful. But usually our deeper mind, our more ingrained patterning, takes more time to resolve. Our intent to let it all be may work well with emotions on the surface, for example, but the underlying patterns lag behind in the process, and only get purified over the long term, with our continued effort.</p>
<p>It's like the way different food gets digested at different rates: some things in your psyche will require more chewing, more digesting, more time just sitting and doing practice, and more time letting practice seep into your life and the way you interface with things. When these issues do get digested they become your wisdom, integrated with you, and not something that can be wrested away. It may be the case that there are emotions or other parts of your mind that you deeply or habitually avoid, and the sleepiness is the pattern's strategy to keep you from going into it, looking, shedding light, and dismantling the pattern: it may be ego trying to preserve itself. Sometimes drowsiness is a defensive mechanism to keeps you from going deeper.</p>
<p>But in general, unless something comes clear about it in your understanding (which will happen from time to time) you just continue. You continue clarifying your direction and method, and you continue just doing practice; and that takes care of all these kinds of obstacles.</p>
<p>It is a very good idea to connect with a teacher and group. The guidance, the view that transcends your self-centeredness, the living example, the community and shared energy, the rigor of the form, and the supporting structure will all help your practice, and may be just what you need to cast off drowsiness. Even if drowsiness continues, you can learn how to practice effectively until the pattern is purified.</p>
