  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Why is your overall goal to reach <em>jhana</em>? What do you suppose it will do to get concentration?</p>
<p>There are deepening levels of <em>jhana</em>; but these are achieved for the sake of another overarching goal, they are not ends in themselves.</p>
<p>Lacking correct motivation, it will be difficult to progress very far; motivation that doesn't align with your innate purpose as a human will peter out, or will simply not be there for you when you begin to face certain obstacles. The reason for this is that the basis of the motivation is weak; it depends on an illusory self that is supposedly reaping the benefit. So the more you generate wanting something, the weaker your foundation will be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you connect with the purpose that reflects your innate being, it appears very naturally; and since that purpose goes beyond wanting something for yourself the motivation doesn't let you down when you start reaching your personal limits. Your innate being has no concept of "I, my, me"; it is already complete. The motivation that connects with that completion is compassionate, generous, all-embracing. It doesn't fixate on <em>getting</em> this and that.</p>
<p><em>Jhana</em> means you and the object of meditation become one. Relinquishing the illusion of separate selfhood is required. As <em>jhana</em> begins to dissipate the sense of self, if your motivation is based only on self, the motivation will also dissipate. In order to get and possess what 'you' want, the 'you' needs to exist. As the 'you' merges with the object of meditation and ceases to exist, the self-serving motivation is no longer valid. And when you meet obstacles or when the timeline becomes longer than you expect or when greater effort is required, the self-serving mind begins to doubt that it's all worth it, and that motivation falls down. So you can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There are certainly guidelines about the kinds of attitudes, behaviors, and conditions that contribute to concentration; but many of these are necessarily achieved gradually, not through a single rash or heroic effort.</p>
<p>For instance, ethical behavior is a necessity. If you do negative action, harming yourself and others, your mind cannot be balanced. But how is ethical perfection something that can be achieved overnight? It is not. It has to be undertaken as a practice over the long term. You first have to learn what constitutes negative and positive action. That takes time. You won't understand everything at first. Whatever karmic burden you carry from past negative actions is already blinding you to certain teachings; so you actually have to <em>practice</em> ethical behavior in order to learn deeply. As you learn more, you also need to apply mindfulness, since even knowing a lot can't help you if you are oblivious to your own actions. This too necessarily develops gradually, through study and practice. How can you become 100% mindful just at the snap of your fingers?</p>
<p>There are many more considerations. The best chance — <em>theoretically</em> the way to do it the fastest — is to find an awakened teacher and practice group, and submit completely to their guidance, step by step. It means giving up your idea of what should be happening, and only following the training. In this way you create a firm foundation upon which each new step is built, and you don't have to go back later to do repairs or retrace your steps to fulfill what has been missed.</p>
<p>This is theoretically the fastest way; but the way it plays out in life may differ. Trying to push yourself into a situation that doesn't suit your life or your character could waste time and create obstacles. On the other hand, some people seek their right practice situation for many years, even decades; but once they find it they progress very quickly. So there's no saying what the 'best' way is; you have to be very practical and clear about where you are right now in your life, and what the current situation requires. Don't supplant reality with your fantasy about what there is to be attained.</p>
<p>So really, instead of being so object-oriented, thinking in terms of <em>getting</em> some particular thing, it is much more helpful and much more conducive of spiritual refinement to be <em>path</em>-oriented, taking care of the journey step by step. <em>How</em> will you travel? What kind of attitude will you wield from situation to situation: Selfish, or generous? Narrow view, or open to possibility?</p>
<p>Some concrete changes that can contribute to concentration-style practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarify and simplify your relationships.</strong> You don't need to abandon friends; but neither do you need to entangle yourself in trivial matters. Be willing to let go of pursuits that don't further spiritual progress. Always practice kind, helpful speech. Don't gossip or joke around too much. Always be humble, and don't bother even playing at being prideful, much less actually showing off about knowledge or attainments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarify and simplify your activities.</strong> Abandon that which leads to upheaval in your mind and heart. Take up that which leads to evenmindedness, peace, and clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarify and simplify your environment.</strong> Keep your living space clean and orderly. Get rid of excess. Get rid of things that aren't essential, or that lead you toward trivial thoughts, or that incite craving. Surround yourself with beauty and open space. Make friends with emptiness and spaciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring your <strong>sleeping</strong>, <strong>eating</strong>, and <strong>physical activity</strong> into balance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper, undisturbed sleep, in a good and regular schedule is necessary. Getting to sleep before 11pm and waking before sunrise is ideal. If you're actually doing spiritual practice, too much sleep is worse than too little. Not having enough sleep harms the body; but having too much sleep harms the spirit. </p>
<p>Balanced nutrition, taken in at the appropriate times is necessary. The bigger meals should be earlier in the day (some monks who do mostly meditation during the day eat only in the morning). Don't eat after 8pm; and heavy meat-based meals should be eaten even earlier so the digestion process doesn't interfere with regeneration through sleep. Avoid sugars and very processed foods; avoid overstimulating foods like very hot spice and garlic; limit meat and dairy or become completely vegetarian.</p>
<p>Do vigorous physical activity daily, enough to break a sweat. Breathe deeply. Practice physical relaxation, and move every part of the body every day. Balance work and rest, as too much of either unbalances the mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Find a teacher</strong> and <strong>join their practice group</strong>. Attend every teaching and practice session possible, and offer your help to them. Don't expect the teacher to do it for you, but rather make the most of what they offer. Confidently share your benefit with the community by offering your effort and possessions, and cut off the needy, taking mentality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn the method</strong> very well. Remove all doubt. Consult with your teacher to clarify points you're not sure about. <strong>Be completely meticulous</strong> about applying the method; don't let your own preference and opinion overshadow the method; don't tinker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these conditions are met, to some extent there is a direct relationship between the amount of practice you do and the results you get. But once you begin to reach the limit of your capacity, more pushing becomes counterproductive. Note that <em>you</em> don't know what your capacity is. It may be lesser or (usually) greater than you think it is. The teacher often knows better, and can see where you're at on the path. Very commonly we see newcomers with wonderful, far-reaching aspiration that completely outstrips their capacity; and then, of course, they get discouraged. If they push very hard they may even encounter painful or disturbing experiences that push them away from practice completely. It is not the fault of the practice; it is because the practice has not been applied in a balanced way. So trying to go fast, fast, fast can make you go slow. Don't be so object oriented; only take care of the present situation. Then things will unfold naturally, and already your practice will be correct — already you will have correct attainment.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There is the story of a student who approached a Zen Master about gaining an awakening experience (<em>kensho</em>):</p>
<p>&gt; The student asked, "How long will it take for me to reach <em>kensho</em>?"</p>
<p>&gt; The Master replied, "Oh, maybe ten years."</p>
<p>&gt; This is not what the student wanted to hear! He asked, "Well, what if I try very hard and devote myself completely to it?"</p>
<p>&gt; The Master replied, "Then, fifteen years."</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
