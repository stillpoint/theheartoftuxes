  <h1>Should I keep a record of my meditation 'experiences'?</h1>

<p>You should distinguish between the aim of meditation, which is to be free of the enslaving and deluding grip of thought, and the aim of dream interpretation, which is to provide information on the movements of your mind and life. If you mix the two it could become an obstacle to both.</p>
<p>If you are doing meditation, just do meditation. After your sitting, if you want to briefly jot down something that happened, you can do it; and then let it go. You may find that as you sit you will start to get more involved and excited about the images and experiences that arise, <em>so that you can record them in your log</em>. This will show you that taking notes is a problem, stimulating your attachment to thinking. If this happens you should let it go and just do meditation. Trust the process and don't think that you need to steer it yourself. There's a deep fear of letting go in us, brought out by meditation; so very often meditators will overthink their process in an unconscious attempt to gain a comforting sense of control. Instead, you should practice trust and confidence in not-knowing; let the method gradually awaken you.</p>
<p>But if writing something down helps you let it go, or provides some information down the road, it's not a big deal to do it. Just don't think that you'll be losing something if you don't hold on to all your thoughts. Trust in your deeper resources. If you practice clarity, you will be better able to face future events directly than if you try to hold onto a whole bunch of thought-baggage. It's like traveling with too many suitcases â€” you can't move if you hold on.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated form of meditation journal is for helping you see the strategies that help you progress and the obstacles that set you back. Especially if you are practicing alone, without a teacher or group, this kind of journal could be helpful for the bit of objectivity it may provide.</p>
<p>This goes along with a very mature intent to take on a course of training, and a clear commitment to a clear method. Carry through the method to its full result. This is the kind of setting in which a meditation journal can make sense. In other situations writing and imagining may easily overshadow the meditation. Because we are so habituated to seeking objects rather than making space and ungrasping things, the practitioner can automatically think there is inherently more importance in the thought and written <em>things</em> than in the somewhat uncomfortable open space that preceded them. But just the opposite is true.</p>
<p>So this sort of reflective meditation journal is not about dabbling, but about being meticulous and even-minded about the whole process. If you had already learned a method from a teacher so that you could perform it without hesitation or doubt, and if you were setting considerable periods of time aside every day for practice without access to your teacher, or if you were committing to a long solo retreat, having the overview of the journal could be valuable. The practitioner uses curiosity, awareness, and intelligence in writing the journal logs. Rather than getting lost in drama, the practitioner shines an even but unflinching awareness on the events of the meditation, taking the opportunity to listen openly to the whole bodymind organism and learn what is there to be learned. The learning bubbles up from the space by itself; it is not cobbled together with discursive thinking.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The great master Namgyal Rinpoche recommended both a short period of setting intention before practice and a short period of both unstructured listening and organized reviewing after each meditation. This was for students who had received clear instructions and were carrying out a course of training in their own private spaces. He talks about it here in a book of his recorded retreat teachings, <em>Body, Speech, &amp; Mind</em>:</p>
<p>&gt;The entire environment [of a traditional monastery, temple, or retreat center] is supportive to the work of meditation. It is customary to sleep only two hours each night.</p>
<p>&gt;If one is lacking the wholesome environment of a retreat center in which to practise, the equivalent of an empty house will do. Any empty room in a house, any room not used for other purposes, is suitable for meditation. Take care with your posture; do not try a difficult (for you) meditation position for your practice. If you are working at getting into a full-lotus, do that some other time. If you cannot sit cross-legged with the spine straight, sit in a chair for the meditation session, and practise to develop a better posture another time in the day.</p>
<p>&gt; Each meditation session should be about fifty-five minutes. [This is for his assigned work on <em>Satipatthana</em>, specifically mindfulness of breathing.] Use the remaining five minutes of the hour for doing review work. It is advisable to do the review as you are coming out of the meditation. The review should be somewhat like a scientific recall of the meditation; seeing back through the events, not rationalizing about what did or did not occur. The mind should be alert and clear, but not tense. Do not get up and dash off right away to your next involvement; leave a bit of space after you sit.</p>
<p>&gt;Before going into the meditation exercise, you should very briefly think about what insight you would like to accomplish. Form a question: it can be a question about anything, whatever you want to see more clearly. If you have not seen a decent cakra recently [I think here Namgyal is not referring to a bodily chakra but to some insight about how things move], ask about that. State the question before beginning the formal exercise, then drop the question and get on with the exercise. Hopefully the meditation will bear fruit within the fifty-five minutes and you will experience ecstatic absorption in the midst of the practice. If that is so, as you are coming out of the absorption the mind will be crystal clear. It will then revert to the question you posed at the beginning of the practice. The ego-clinging state of consciousness is not there, the mind is very clear, so it is quite likely that a symbol will arise in response to your question. After that information has been received from the depth, you may experience a sense of surprise. Then, if the fifty-five minutes are not over, you can pose another question, drop it, and go back to the exercise again.</p>
<p>&gt;In the course of one fifty-five minute session, it is possible to get three answers to dharma questions. Depending on your questions, you can make very wondrous advances in knowledge by working this way. Spend a little extra time after finishing the formal meditation in recalling the entire session and questioning what occurred. This time should not be spent so much in interpretation for the session as in seeing again the experiences of the hour. (By the way, the answer to your question may very likely appear in the form of an impacted symbol.) During the review, take the answers to the questions and question these answers, look into them.</p>
<p>&gt;When you come to the end of the meditation time, stop. Do not go over the hour. Do the review to see what other insights you might also be given. It may deepen the recalling abilities to write the review, but that is really only suitable for the beginning meditator, one who is still establishing a practice. Do not carry that on for too long. You will have to cease to be civilized to be successful at meditation. And even if you are sitting for several hours each day, you still do a review at the end of each hour.</p>
