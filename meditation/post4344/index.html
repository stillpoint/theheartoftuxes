  <h1>Can't stop 'forcing' my breath when trying to mindfully watch it</h1>

<p>Ah, yes, my "dropping" friend. How are you?</p>
<p>&gt;"Just realize that <em>easier</em> does not necessarily equal <em>better</em>."</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Then why do you say that you don't recommend breathing meditations for those prone to forcing the process? Surely if they find this to be an issue they should be sticking with it as it is something they need to understand/overcome.</em></p>
<p>Not all difficult practice is good or useful. But sometimes deep practice is difficult because it is deep: it highlights our attachments and dysfunctional patterns, and requires us to overcome them. If it were easy, then we wouldn't have to develop any capabilities other than those we already have; so there is no growth in that practice.</p>
<p>But the effort put out in practice mustn't be a grasping, wanting, making kind of effort. It should move in the direction of sincerity, generosity, and trust. If the meditator is repeatedly trying to control the situation (for example, trying to create or avoid certain mind states by controlling the breath), that is not correct meditation. It ingrains the controlling habit, making it deeper. The more one permits oneself these indulgences, the easier and more automatic it becomes to carry them out again in the future.</p>
<p>Ideally, this is something to be worked out in face-to-face communication with a teacher. The teacher can understand the mind of the practitioner and will be able to guide it. Without the presence of a discerning teacher, one has to be honest with oneself: has one exhausted every effort to surrender to the method, or is one holding on — trying to have one's cake and eat it too?</p>
<p>Being very meticulous with the method is very often enough of an aid. So what is the method you are practicing? Is the method to be still and hold stillness at the end of the exhalation, or is that something that comes from your own grasping? If I recall correctly, the instruction is simply to observe the breath at the nostrils, and to note any other themes that arise before letting go of them and returning to observing. So when wanting stillness arises, you can note "wanting" or "wanting stillness", observe what that is like, and then drop it and return to the breath. And when panic or discomfort arise, you can note "panic" or "discomfort", experience the situation clearly, and then drop it and return to observing the breath.</p>
<p>But if you are saying that you inevitably try to control the breath, I might consider recommending other meditations that are not so prone to manipulation. There are many good ways — good methods of practicing presence — and there are also many good ways to develop the concentration before perhaps returning to your current method, armed with a greater ability to surrender. Given the wealth of options, one might want to move past this issue and get comfortable in another practice.</p>
<p>There is always the likelihood that the same controlling tendency will crop up in any practice you undertake, but breathing-based meditations seem to be particularly susceptible because of the extremely subtle mind-body-breath connections present.</p>
<p>Sincerity and trust... sincerity and trust are so important and so valuable. They amount to the "knack" of practice — actualizing it, making it yours. They are hard to teach; they come from your own decision, your own belief in yourself. You don't always have to have the perfect meditation. Only your <em>trying</em> should be perfect. Do it just to be sincere, just to express your pure nature, without trying to get delicious stillness or tantalizing insight or a sense of comfort. Just offer yourself to the method.</p>
<p>Then when something imperfect arises, it's no problem. Don't step outside of the meditation and check how it's going; only stay in the center, making a sincere momentary effort. The effort radiates from your center; it doesn't ever have to turn back around to look at how things are going. Just be sincere and trust it all. Trust your effort, trust the method, and trust the universe.</p>
<p>The push-and-pull at the end of the breath is a game you play with surrender and death. You want to go into it to taste the empty stillness there. The out-breath is an emptying, and at the end of it is an open still point. It can be very comfortable to rest there. But the self-making habit is terrified of emptiness and stillness. It wants to be alive; it doesn't want openness, it wants to be <em>something</em>. So not only does it rush to take in a breath (which is the gathering, establishing energy), it also then engages in the blame game to get you to <em>be</em> the struggling victim, to <em>be</em> the failure, to <em>be</em> the blamer, to <em>be</em> the analyst... to be, to be, to be.</p>
<p>So in each breath, this drama appears: "Do I surrender to the stillness — do I die to it? — or do I step back from the ledge and gather myself?" The anticipation of the drama grows, until the whole backstory of the meditation is this struggle at the end of the breath. "Who will win?"</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is the ego's handiwork. It has taken over the agenda of the meditation to keep you <em>being</em> something, <em>thinking</em> something, <em>making</em> something. At the moment you realize this, you can note it, experience it, drop it, and return sincerely to the method. Just the method.</p>
<p>Perhaps understanding this dynamic will help you let go. Again, sincerity and trust are important. Just let go. Your letting go doesn't necessarily mean the controlling habit will go away, or the panic, or the thinking about it. That doesn't matter; it's not your business to check those things. Only by sincere. Be pure in your trying.</p>
<p>If you find some movement on this issue after reading this, fine. Just continue. If the difficulty remains, we can look into other methods. You just have to be honest with yourself about how well you have tried. If your trying has been sincere, there is absolutely no blame; there is only practical choice.</p>
