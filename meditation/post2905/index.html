  <h1>Breathing techniques?</h1>

<p>There are countless breathing techniques. The question is why try one instead of another — what is the aim?</p>
<p>The aim of relaxation gives us more to aim at; just saying 'meditation' is so broad and vague as to be useless as a guiding principle. But even then, what is the aim <em>beyond</em> relaxation; that is, <em>relax for what purpose</em>? Physical health? Mental health? Develop the ability to relax in stressful situations? Use relaxation to support an ongoing way of life aimed at awakening, enlightenment?</p>
<p>One of the main issues to be dealt with is the controlling habit that is very easily wielded in breath practice. Breath, body, and mind are so intimately connected that, while it may promote a certain stillness and calmness to force the breath into certain patterns, the egocentric, small-minded controlling habit can also be increased.</p>
<p>So when working with the breath, it is a very good idea to be clear on the value of openhandedness from the very beginning, and to continually revisit and clarify that attitude over the months and years ahead. If you get into a relationship with your mind where you try to force it to be a certain way, you will not only suffer in the long run, you will also cause suffering for those around you as you push certain parts of your psyche into the shadows, bringing about unconscious upheavals and reactions.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of a session, please take some moments to completely let go. Let go physically, finding a comfortable posture and letting the tension and weight of the body settle. Let go mentally and emotionally, consciously releasing any and all agendas. Vow only to follow the method, not to try getting a particular feeling or mood or view or insight. This means that you relax into things-as-they-are, and with your whole being you value things-as-they-are more than any self-centered agenda.</p>
<p>This is something that has to be practiced and expressed over and over, at the beginning of sessions, throughout formal practice, and in daily life: let it go, let it be, put it all down.</p>
<p>For the modern person, it is almost always the case that the mind is overactive. There is too much naming and judging activity that happens with the thinking mind. The balancing breath is therefore weighted toward the passive, resting and letting-go part of the cycle — the exhalation — as opposed to the active inhalation. The classic balance in yogic traditions that spread from India through Tibet, China, and Japan is breathing in for three counts and breathing out for seven counts. This can be simplified to letting the out-breath be about twice as long as the in-breath. There are other more subtle explanations for the timing, but in general it means coming back into balance between the active and passive parts of your mental aspect.</p>
<p>I am talking about a breathing practice because you asked specifically. There are many, many other methods that don't center on the breath; and in addition, the breath is worked with in various ways depending on the traditions and methods you're involved with. But this is a good, simple <em>breath</em> practice for relaxation: breathe out for about twice as long as you breathe in.</p>
<p>Within this form, try to be as easy and natural as possible. The ease is more important than being exact, at this level. (In some energy work it is more important to be exact.) The letting-go you do at the beginning of your sitting will bear fruit as you continue your relaxation practice.</p>
<p>Ideally, let the majority of the breath be guided by the belly. This is a natural, deep way of breathing that we use when we are born, but it often has to be re-learned later in life because patterns of tension have covered it up. Either within this breathing practice, or as a separate exercise, you can feel your belly expand and contract with the breath. Sit on the edge of a chair or cushion in a way that lets your belly hang comfortably. You can place a hand or both hands on the lower belly and feel them rise and fall with the breath. It is a way of breathing associated with calmness and centeredness. If the belly is tight and closed and the breath is only guided by the upper chest, that is a breathing pattern associated with fear and grasping at control — not conducive to deep relaxation. Best of all is to allow the breath to gradually fill and empty in and out of the whole torso, including the belly, sides of the ribs, and upper chest. If you can do this without adding any tension, good; if tension arises, maybe continue with the belly breathing and practice full-torso breathing separately (perhaps lying down with one hand on the belly and one hand on the chest).</p>
<p>I you want extra practice for the belly or full-torso breathing you can picture yourself as a big water balloon being filled from the bottom to the top, and then emptied from the top to the bottom. (Some yogic practices reverse the order, but perhaps you should seek out in-person guidance if you want to try that way.)</p>
<p>Sitting comfortably will train your relaxation in combination with waking awareness, helping you translate that relaxation to everyday life. Lying down to practice will train relaxation at deeper, near-sleep levels and possibly promote greater regenerative power, though likely at the cost of a presence engaged with waking reality.</p>
<p>This is one way among many good ways. And there are yet more methods that are problematic in one way or another. Take care not to let forced methods or grasping attitudes slip in, which could lead to mental or physical instability down the road. If you start getting into energy manipulation it is essential to study under an expert teacher and follow their guidance meticulously.</p>
<p>Good luck relaxing!</p>
