  <h1>Been meditating for 57 days, I don't see any benefit..</h1>

<p>Did you do all the various methods listed, did you focus on one method, or a few? If you like, you can recount the precise method you're using (I'm not going to listen to all the soundtracks to find out).</p>
<p>Your post does raise the question of what to expect from meditation. What do <em>you</em> expect?</p>
<p>Attainment does not imply any particular feeling or experience. In fact, if one tries to get a certain feeling or cause a certain state of mind to arise, meditation will almost certainly become a problem or fail altogether.</p>
<p>This also highlights the ungrounded nature of instruction without a tradition and a correct teacher-student transmission. Some benefits can be gained from recorded guided meditations, but it's not always clear what the intent is, or what it should be; and the whole matter of <em>context</em> tends to be missing: what does this mean for your life, how is it supported by lifestyle, what are the challenges and the requirements regarding integration of the method, and so on?</p>
<p>Many online sources that try to maintain a secular stance are well-meaning but not themselves deeply insightful: the broadcasters themselves have not yet attained the full potential of the practice, much less understood how to teach it; and in trying to keep the practice widely accessible and religion-free they may cut away or dumb-down too much of the teaching. </p>
<p>I'm not saying meditation has to be religious. Not at all. But for it to be effective in your life, the context of your life has to be taken into account and taught. And when you go into a proper (not a made-up) meditation more deeply, you will almost certainly have what can be spoken of as 'religious <em>experience</em>' -- old views may crumble; a shocking or moving breadth and intimacy of experience may appear -- and this experience should be addressed: you should know what part is significant and what part is not; you should know the proper mindset and approach to these new experiences. So learning from a live teacher within a tradition -- where the practice has a very strong and clear lifestyle context, and is not uprooted from its many grounding influences -- is important.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems that solitary practitioners face is their own checking mind. One wants to check, to see how one is doing. One wants to compare one's experience to certain readings or the reports of others, or to one's pop-culture images of attainment ("am I like that monk guy from <em>Kung Fu</em> yet?").</p>
<p>This checking happens to all people and all meditators; but it is not correct meditation. Without the influence of a teacher, a group of other meditators, a clear and visible tradition of practice, and a formal schedule and structure of practice, one's own mind in isolation finds little to dissuade it from repeatedly checking. This becomes an obstacle to the meditation itself, but also can undermine one's wisdom about what constitutes success. Based only on one's own inexperienced estimate, the judgment of one's practice may come up lacking -- you may assume that you've failed, when in fact you're doing quite well.</p>
<p>Correct meditation means that your mind doesn't move: it isn't swayed by objects. Some high-class meditations keep this state without the use of an object of focus; but most newcomers require a very clear and accessible object as an anchor for the mind; so most popular meditations tend to be object-based and concentration-style. It is not pure meditation, but it is a way that works for many beginners.</p>
<p>In object meditation, one gives up all other objects as distractions, and keeps returning to the single object of concentration. 'Concentration' means you have the power to relinquish distraction. The efficacy of the practice comes as you develop the ability to let go of the things that would usually otherwise grab and occupy your mind.</p>
<p>Some objects move your mind more than others, because they are very pleasurable or very uncomfortable to you. Some objects will likely be associated with personal addictions that move your mind very strongly; e.g., when a piece of cake, or glass of alcohol, or pretty girl appears, it may instantly control your mind. For many of us, the addiction had more to do with our self-image, so we attach strongly to having fame or being seen as an expert or a strong person or a beautiful person, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, the whole world of idle thought is a huge distracting influence. Even silly gossip, trivial details, mindless arguments, and the like, grab our minds and control them. How much more so when the train of thought has some emotional content for us!</p>
<p>In fact, our whole life and our whole sense of reality is shaped by the things that our mind attaches to, the ways that mind is grabbed and moved here and there by objects.</p>
<p>Therefore, the liberating power of meditation is in your ability to let go of an object.</p>
<p>When the act of letting go is repeated many times, the ability is trained. You get better at letting go, your mind is not grabbed and controlled by as many objects, and you can begin to see and act from a place of reality rather than habitual thought-based life.</p>
<p>There are many possible objects of meditation. Some work better for specific people and types of mentality; others are fairly universal. Some objects have negative influence and should be avoided. But in general it is not the object that is significant but rather your letting-go and returning that are important. You build the ability to let go of unreality (the thoughts and other objects that grab and move your mind) and return to reality (plain seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, and clear thinking without any added overlay of concept or dream).</p>
<p>To succeed in meditation, you should start with a traditional, proven method (not a randomly selected method of unknown origin or someone's made-up pet project).</p>
<p>You should learn the method very well, and know both the 'how' and the 'why' of it. You should also learn what constitutes success within that method, and how to identify it. These are best taught in person, by someone who has done the practice themselves and has attained its full fruition.</p>
<p>And you should apply the method very meticulously, not changing it according to your preference or limited view, not blending it with other styles, not hedging on its requirements. This is they only way the method can provide a mirror for your mind. If the form is clear, you will know very well when you've departed from it. If the form is unclear or if you make compromises, ego starts to run the show, and it will be very hard to see the ways your mind tricks you. </p>
<p>The application of method is best trained in a group that has a very clear intent and practice form. The outer form helps your inner clarity; and the group helps you commit, and gives you many examples of regular humans trying sincerely, facing and overcoming challenges, and progressing along the path.</p>
