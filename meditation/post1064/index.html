  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Your question isn't whether it's better to avoid or seek distraction. Your question is whether we give you permission to change your practice. You are avoiding responsibility for your own decision, no doubt because at some level you know that you have to remain consistent in order to get anything more than fleeting results.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I can't help but be distracted...</em></p>
<p>This is insincere. It is a story that you buy into; and that story becomes your identity, your ego. "I can't...." "It's too hard this way...." "I need a better way...." What you need is to stop judging practice from such an entitled, impatient viewpoint, and to do what it takes to achieve stability.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to have faith in your practice.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to have a proper practice (one proven to obtain the results you're looking for), learn it well, have it modeled for you by someone who has attained its fruits, and you need to stick with it. Then you will gain faith through the results you get from consistent application. Inconsistent effort brings inconsistent result. Looking for outside situations to make things easy for you makes you weak.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In meditation, only do pure practice: follow the method, and maintain non-grasping, non-avoiding, non-reactive mind.</p>
<p>Outside of meditation, 'be a child of illusion': consider nothing a distraction, but only follow the situation.</p>
<p>If something takes you away from plain, simple non-distraction, just return in a plain, simple way. Don't try to arrange the world. Don't try to tweak your practice or invent a magic recipe for problem-free living. Don't check your situation or condition, constantly judging how you're doing (whether you're more or less distracted); the checking itself is distraction.</p>
<p>Don't touch your mind; let it be. Only do your chosen practice (if it is a proper practice and you've learned it properly).</p>
<p>In terms of the environment to seek out, there are traditional recommendations for an environment supportive of meditation. You can try to achieve these to the best of your ability; but at the same time, have equanimity and contentment with whatever situation is possible for you. Again, outside of meditation, you neither need to seek out trouble nor hide from it; only follow your situation and maintain your proper harmonious relationship to it.</p>
<p>What you are able to undertake depends on your stability in practice. Some teachers call this your 'center' or your 'Dharma energy'. If your center — your ability to be non-reactively present — is strong, then you can go anywhere and be with any type of person in any situation, and still maintain clarity, wisdom, and compassion. If your center is not strong, you need to protect your mind from negative influences, because they will control your mind and cause it to develop attachments or aversions, anxiety or dullness, bad habits, narrow opinions, self-centered behaviors, negative emotions, etc.</p>
<p>Changing from practice to practice often seems like you're being clever and 'trading up' to what you think of as a more effective tool or weapon, but actually it is mostly training the monkey-mind — the agitated, flitting, picking-and-choosing habit. It practices that habit and makes it stronger. This is what happens when you always try to change the situation to suit you rather than sticking with things-as-they-are and finding your contentment and stability within that. It's the difference between looking for a pacifier and finding your own inner resources that lead to maturity.</p>
<p>Countless people here online try to invent their own practice, throwing together snippets they've heard or read from this or that source, thinking they are being smart whenever things start to feel good or become easy. That is just the ego taking control of the process; when it finds what it wants (control, division, status-quo, non-accountability), it feels relief; but it is false relief, because it has no ability to <em>stay with</em> a situation.</p>
<p>Ego and monkey-mind thus go hand-in-hand: the picking-choosing, object-obsessed monkey mind gives one the sense that one is <em>doing</em> something productive; it keeps the sense of active selfhood alive. Meditation lets go of that. It doesn't require doing doing doing and the maintenance of ego identity. It stays with <em>what is</em> and calls on the inner resources of equanimity, perseverance, attention, and contentment, and thus the resources increase and become available in life.</p>
<p>Therefore questions like this are flawed from the start. Inviting opinions about practice is flawed. Giving opinions about practice is flawed. Figuring out practice based on what feels better is flawed. Inventing practice based on limited understanding is flawed.</p>
<p>Don't try to invent your practice, because what you invent will have your current habits, views, and ignorance built into it. Don't cobble together random opinions from anonymous people of questionable attainment, because what you cobble together will have the collective and chaotic habits views, and ignorance of the commenters built into it. Go to a proper attained and approved living source of a proven traditional practice; learn it patiently and completely (without arrogantly assuming you understand it); and apply it meticulously. Rather than looking for easy success, look to give your best effort and break through your limitations.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Finally, people are always asking "What's the best for me; should I do <em>this</em> or <em>that</em>?" It's not horrible, but it's not mature. Always thinking "for me... for me... for me..." prevents practice from growing beyond egotism, beyond self-centered, acquisitive mind habit. Don't be so urgent about getting things your way. Instead, enjoy showing up for practice, showing up in life-as-it-is, and showing up for the sake of others. This is the power that allows us to go beyond the cramped self-centered habit.</p>
