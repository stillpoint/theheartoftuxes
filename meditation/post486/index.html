  <h1>Looking for ideas on how to do a one day, solitary "retreat"</h1>

<p>Only meditation all day is very difficult, and could easily be counter-productive, both because the mind can get stale and also because it is so difficult that you run the risk of becoming despondent and blowing up the whole endeavor. A schedule balanced between active and passive tends to offer a better practice experience.</p>
<p>First, the motivation, method, and schedule should be very clear. You don't want to be flying by the seat of your pants, making guesses as you go. You don't want to open the door for self-negotiation, compromise, and other manifestations of doubt. On the contrary, you want to have a certainty about what you're doing and why, so that you can progressively let go of concerns about the format and let the mind settle deeply and comfortably.</p>
<p>Are you very clear on your method? Do you know what to do when physical, mental, or emotional discomfort arises? Do you know what to do with thoughts? Do you understand the point of your particular method — what the method is meant to produce? If you are not so clear on any of these points, your retreat may be well spent by getting clear, doing research and testing out the options. It's important not to be vague about what you're doing, and the further you hope to progress the more significant it becomes. You may even consider seeking out a group experience rather than a solo retreat, until you are able to respond with certainty to the various challenges that will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>I've found that one of the major disruptions in solo retreats is the issue of preparing and eating meals. A one-day retreat is not as problematic in that regard as a weekend, week-long, or longer retreat; but you still need to decide what (if anything) you will eat, and how it will be prepared. I've been in situations where just arranging the space, cooking the food, gathering water, cleaning up, and rearranging the practice objects seemed to take as much time as the meditation; and that's not necessarily stuff you want to be doing. So you need to clarify the nuts and bolts of preparing meals and eating.</p>
<p>Some people on solo retreat will only eat in the morning, and then alternate sitting and walking meditation for the day until the close of retreat. No lunch. This is more Theravada style. If the activity is very sedate, no meal is necessary.</p>
<p>Other styles may involve different activities. A more Mahayana style retreat may schedule sitting and walking, but also recitation of vows and dedications, prostrations, chanting, mantra, physical exercise, quiet break time, and a period or two of simple manual work (cleaning, gardening, chopping wood, repairing the house, picking up garbage, etc.). If you haven't done long sittings, I'd recommend against having more than two or three sittings in a row. Walking meditation, casual aware walking (if a secluded path is available), prostrations, and/or yoga/martial arts/physical exercise help the breath and energy flow and settle, which helps meditation. They also, along with work practice, helps you to digest your experience in meditation and train the ability to put your clear mind into action.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, you should write it down with times and durations so it's very clear.</p>
<p>In a solitary setting, a proper altar and image of devotion can be especially helpful. The mind already has a tendency to wander; when you're alone, it may wander to feelings of isolation, inadequacy, wavering doubt, despondency... in a nutshell, you may lose your way. So a place of ritual focus, where your senses and thoughts can return and be guided to positive and sublime aspiration, can act as a stabilizing influence. An image of Buddha, peaceful, concentrated, compassionate, noble, can speak to your aspiration. You can deepen your connection and commitment to those qualities by gazing on the image and offering yourself to the living presence symbolized by it. If another religion or path is your way, the symbol of its highest attainment can take the central place.</p>
<p>One or three flowers bring inspiration through the sight, smell, and touch. Candles express your inner radiance; clear water expresses your inner clarity; incense expresses the delightful purifying influence of your good character.</p>
<p>If you find yourself wavering or flagging, hang out in front of your altar and let it awaken your sincerity and devotion. Gather strength and solace from it. If it happens that you think of quitting or feel you've bitten off more than you can chew, don't give up entirely but rather come to the altar and make prayers and vows. Ask for strength; ask for guidance; ask to be shown how to surrender yourself; express your thanks for life, well-being, good teaching, and good practice conditions; offer your wishes and commitments to awakening and acting with compassion toward all beings. It's a give and take. Offer your best intentions through a flow of your sincere thoughts and feelings; and take in the support and abilities of the enlightened ones (all of whom have been invited by your altar). This is far from time wasted; it creates the conditions for strong practice in the future.</p>
<p>I would avoid bringing books or writing materials. Don't try to hold on to any realization; that's a diversion, a blind alley. Practice relying only on your practice, which should be openhanded and present in the real moment. If you want to use written teaching at all, work with a single concise phrase (for example, one of the slogans from Seven Points Of Mind Training in Tibetan Buddhism).</p>
<p>You may find some sample retreat schedules by doing an internet search for various temples and meditation centers. Here's one possible format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning practice space, setting up altar</li>
<li>Vows and dedication of practice (voicing your noble intent)</li>
<li>Morning prostrations or physical exercise</li>
<li>Break to wash and drink water</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Breakfast 9am</li>
<li>Casual walk, or work practice</li>
<li>Chanting</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Lunch 12 noon</li>
<li>Casual walk, or nature observation (wind in trees/water flowing/clouds or clear sky)</li>
<li>Mantra</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Sitting</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Facing the altar</li>
<li>Gratitude and dedication ("may anything I gained help all others")</li>
<li>Three closing bows</li>
</ul>
<p>If this looks like too much, you can try half a day of strict schedule, and add one sitting or altar practice in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p>What you do after your retreat is important. It's best to taper in gently. Going back to busy activity, celebrating with others, vegging out, taking in words and images, making thinking, or trying to remember experiences or insights can all destroy much of what you attained during the retreat time. You won't know what you attained; so don't think about it or judge it, only move on. But take your time to move on gently and slowly. Schedule some quiet time and do something nice for yourself as a reward. A good healthy meal, a bath, some easy stretching and movement, relaxing on a blanket or hammock — things that are soothing and that won't obliterate any calmness and focus you developed from the day's practice. Avoid abrupt changes for a while.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>I'll be interested to hear how it goes and what you discover. Then you can teach others about the benefits and pitfalls you encountered.</p>
