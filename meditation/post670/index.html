  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>First of all, you should be aware that some very high-level meditators use this method, either exclusively or as a way of entering their primary method. It's not only a beginner's method. It can also become the basis of other methods with very subtle differences in instruction.</p>
<p>Different teachers require different approaches. I've been with teachers who taught to return to 1 at the slightest distraction, and I've been with teachers who taught to return to 1 if you lose count or forget where you are.</p>
<p>Regarding the first approach, one teacher, a Zen Master, said she knows when beginners are doing it wrong, because when she asks if they have been able to reach the count of 10 yet, they say 'yes'. She said it tells her they are not following her described method; i.e., not being strict enough about returning when a thought takes them away.</p>
<p>With this context, it doesn't matter whether you get to 10. It doesn't matter that you constantly count to 3 or 4 and then return. The main thing is letting go and returning. In all similar concentration methods, the power you are training is the power to let go of thoughts that catch you, and to return to momentary reality. Thinking of success as getting further in the count is a mistake. Though it may indeed serve as a sort of signpost when you are consistently able to maintain the count, it is more like a businesslike acknowledgement than a coronation ceremony with fireworks. From the standpoint of aspiration, it is good to know you're progressing step by step.</p>
<p>Ideally, choose one teacher in one tradition, one course of training, and one method. It is not good enough to say "Well, this is Zen, and that is Zen, so...." Each school and sometimes each teacher within a school may have different instructions. Sometimes the instructions will look the same, but will have important differences that make sense within the whole holistic program.</p>
<p>If you don't yet have a teacher, you can still continue meditation; but this is something that you'll need to clarify if you want to progress. In any case, it is very important to be free of doubt as to the method. <em>During your sitting is not the time to be deciding what your method is.</em> If you do it that way, you open the door for your preference, whim, guessing, unconscious tendencies, blind spots, and all else that comes under the category of ignorance, to take control of your practice. Clarity of method, and in fact all practice form, is there so that ignorance <em>won't</em> take control of your practice. You have a clear form so that you can surrender to it, and perceive when those attachments and habits arise. Clear form is the mirror for your mind; when the form is not clear, the mirror becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you approach more subtle layers of mind, it will be important to proceed with confidence. Your letting-go becomes more subtle. You let go of forceful mental acts. I mean, ideally you let go of that already, and just return very lightly and instantly; but as you progress it becomes more and more critical. So for this reason as well, you have to be free of doubt as to your method.</p>
<p>So if you are working with a teacher, consult your teacher. If you are working from various sources, choose one source. If you are working with a book or other not-living guide that is not clear on certain points, you will have to use your wisdom to make a decisive choice about the method.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the important point is to identify when thought grabs you, not necessarily when thought appears. The overall sense is of settling into stability and purity, where the mind is not moved by whatever appears in it. Thought or feeling can appear, but you become so smooth that it can't gain purchase; it doesn't grab you like an octopus tentacle or like velcro.</p>
<p>My sense is that if a meditator becomes too obsessive about checking whether thoughts are grabbing, it actually involves them <em>more</em> rather than less. The focus, which is the counting, becomes overshadowed by the checking. It has an underlying sense of nervousness or mistrust of the landscape of the mind. I don't think this is so productive. It is better to settle in trust of your original mind. Therefore, instead of an attitude that guards against the 'danger' of thought, one adopts the attitude of complete openhandedness: everything is already complete; everything is already okay.</p>
<p>Within this attitude, you keep the lamp of counting burning brightly. Thoughts, feelings, and other mental manifestations may appear; but they don't take you away from the counting, and the counting remains bright and clear. The counting should have two aspects: you should not lose count; and each count (each number) should be vivid. The vividness corresponds to wisdom; the awareness of the whole cycle corresponds to compassion.</p>
<p>I don't want to give a definitive instruction that will interfere with your teacher's instruction. You should consult the source you are learning from. But <em>if</em> you are working with a source that does not/can not address this point, I recommend you return to 1 when a thought grabs you in the slightest. If it takes you away for a moment, or a minute, or a half hour, then as soon as you realize it you can effortlessly and instantly return to 1. This '1' has in important meaning. All of life is at 1.</p>
<p>If your counting is clear and vivid, I suggest that you don't have to return, even though you may perceive vague thoughts in the background.</p>
<p>In either case, it's not a big deal. For example, you might wonder whether momentarily perceiving a thought means that it grabbed you. In that case, you can return to 1; or you can keep going. Just continue very confidently and sincerely. If you are insincere, trying to achieve a higher count, <em>that</em> is a problem. But if you are sincere and if you don't waste a moment hemming and hawing about which way to turn, then you can just proceed. The event is already over; your job is to be momentary.</p>
<p>Is that clear?</p>
<p>In case it helps, I've spent many an hour <em>returning to 1, returning to 1</em>. You can learn a tremendous lesson if you stay meticulous about form. It will become your wisdom, which can't be taken away from you.</p>
