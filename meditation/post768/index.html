  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>The main thing that shines out here is that <em>you want to do the retreat</em>. This is key. That's great that you're jumping in!</p>
<p>Don't worry; only follow the situation from moment to moment. There will be many, many supports for you, many things that help you succeed. The whole setting, the schedule, the teaching, the structure, the other participants -- it will all help you to be in the practice.</p>
<p>When your mind is momentary, there is no problem. Problem comes from thinking. So you develop tension in relationship to practice because of your thinking; not because you don't want to do practice! Help yourself relax as much as possible, by letting go of thinking when it arises instead of following it far down a path of worry; and also do some physical practice, get the body and breath moving.</p>
<p>One way that might help you get into a more consistent practice is to do it purely for the enjoyment of being yourself and not having to think for a while. Go to sitting absolutely consistently (with some compassion for extenuating circumstances), for example as soon as you wake up. Doing it when you wake is a good chance to avoid many of the distractions and avoidance that otherwise take you away.</p>
<p>Only do it, no deciding: when your eyes open in the morning or when your feet first touch the floor, start practice immediately, even as you brush your teeth and then hurry to your cushion or chair and start meditation. (Or even better, do some prostrations and then immediately sit down for meditation.)</p>
<p>Here's the difference: when you sit, focus on relaxing, settling the muscles, letting go of resistance (often people will push against the floor or chair with tension instead of really sinking into their seat), finding the posture that lets you relax through the skeleton, and really enjoying the freedom from having to do or be anything for a while.</p>
<p>The focus is on contentment and enjoyment.</p>
<p>As soon as you feel "that's enough", or as soon as you stop enjoying it or feel like moving on, get up and be glad about how you started your day.</p>
<p>This is different from some traditional models of training, but it establishes the basis for them: you begin to associate practice with enjoyment rather than burdensome duty. In truth, you <em>want</em> to practice, but the way it has emerged in your thinking is an obstacle. So this helps develop positive, joyful associations with practice that assign with your original intent.</p>
<p><em>Once you have confirmed the goodness and enjoyment of meditation in your experience</em>, and once it is a consistent habit, a consistent part of your life, then you can start to go according to a timer and lengthen that application of ease and contentment. We have to practice ease and contentment to make them more accessible to us.</p>
<p>As to whether an intensive retreat will be somehow harmful, that depends on your relationship with yourself. If you are kind to yourself rather than imposing an agenda, you will find your balance. If you come to a point where you're feeling it's too much or you're thinking of quitting, you might ask yourself what would bring you the most peace of mind. In some cases it would be re-dedicating yourself to the commitment; in other cases it would be leaving with no regrets, having given it your best effort. Whatever you decide, do it decisively, strongly. Don't hem and haw. One retreat is not the end of life; you will have a thousand retreats, and your practice will continue for thousands of lifetimes. But it is important too be complete in your action: whatever you are doing, just do it. That is <em>life retreat</em>: whatever you are doing, just do it.</p>
<p>The hardest times in retreat are usually the first few days and the last couple of days. In the first few days, you're just getting used to all the new forms and people. It's like starting a new job: always most stressful on the first day. But there will be help for you. More experienced practitioners and teachers will help hold the form.</p>
<p>In the middle of the retreat, you're just in the flow of things. You know what you're supposed to be doing at any moment, and your mind is much more present in the practice; so there is generally less suffering.</p>
<p>On the last day or so, many people start to anticipate the end and think of 'life outside ', and these thoughts can lead to a lot of agitation and tension. It is really a great opportunity to see how Samsara returns, and how we get caught up in it.</p>
<p>Behind it all -- behind the retreat, the practice, the travel to Kathmandu, even behind posting here with a question -- there is one very important issue: <em>why?</em></p>
<p>Why do practice? Why do anything in life? Only for yourself?</p>
<p>If you connect to great compassionate motivation, and feel it in your heart, it will guide you and keep you safe. That is, all things that befall you will have their right direction and purpose.</p>
<p>"To the meditative mind, everything is of benefit."</p>
<p>What a great opportunity to have space held for you so you can meet your mind intimately!</p>
