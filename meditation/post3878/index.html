  <h1>After one year of meditation, I think I'm starting to lose the grip.</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>Wow, I just tried meditating eyes open and my problem seems to be present with this practice as well.</em></p>
<p>It's all just new experience. No problem.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I noticed the focus of my vision trembled with every inhale and exhale. I felt like I had made a really strong link between my vision and breathing and couldn't hold focus visually if I were to focus on the breath like I used to.</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure if you need to <em>hold</em> focus visually. It sounds like you just need to learn and practice relaxing the vision. This could turn out to be a very good thing for you, as you will be calming down and letting go in a new way.</p>
<p>When I first started practicing meditation decades ago I followed instructions in a book. I started off sitting on the floor facing the drapes in my bedroom, which had a wavy red, white, and blue plaid pattern on them! I would get all kinds of wavy, shifting visual events. </p>
<p>After some weeks or months I figured out on my own that the drapes weren't helping me and that, as interesting as the visual events were, they were not the point of meditation. So I turned to face a blank wall. Then I started to get visions and energetic experiences arising. The blankness was inviting my unconscious mind to spill its guts, which (as most meditators know) happens when you start to withdraw the mind from distractions. Also, because I was on my own I had nothing to compare to, so I didn't know what kind of effort was "normal". Only after some years of practice did I realize that I was really pressing hard and trying more than would be common for others. One of the results of this fiery determination was that a lot of strange experiences (<em>makyo</em> â€” projections of mind and energy) would appear. Fortunately, I knew that these too were not the point of meditation, and I just continued to return to the method.</p>
<p>The process of entering into strange new territory and experiencing new uncertainties, then re-applying myself to the method, was a great gift. It helped me to keep my stability, keep my faith, when things got difficult or strange. Every meditator has to go through new territory repeatedly. Just forge ahead and don't make a drama about it.</p>
<p>Later, I did practice with several exceptional teachers and with many communities (both drop-in and live-in). Both ways â€” on your own, and with support â€” have value. If you maintain your correct direction, <em>every</em> experience has value.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>And after a couple of vision trembling breaths, I got lost in a thought or needed to refocus my vision completely - which felt like I had to start from the beginning.</em></p>
<p>This is correct. The moment you notice you've gone away, just return without making a struggle. Just start again. Great!</p>
<p>&gt;<em>A few times I actually dropped into a dream like state, which is definitely what I'm looking for.</em></p>
<p>I think you mean it's <em>not</em> what you're looking for.</p>
<p>There will be challenges associated with being in the world. Those are not problems, they are just challenges. They become problems when <em>you</em> label them "bad" or "wrong", or make a suffering story about them.</p>
<p>One of the major aspects of your training is letting go of checking. Our habit is to step outside of our experience and see how it's going, then label it one thing or another. But our true life can't be labeled; it's not just one thing or another; it's <em>this</em> [what's happening this moment]. So resist the tendency to check, and avoid making a story about your experience.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that you get taken away. That happens according to our karma, our constellation of patterns and habits based on how we have previously used our body, speech, and mind. What matters is that you develop skill in returning. Your returning is best done immediately and effortlessly, without fighting the situation or yourself. That clean returning becomes great power; your center becomes stronger, you remain present longer and more deeply, you become intimate with the moment however it appears.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Maybe it's because I have no experience in meditating with eyes open and maybe cause I happened to meditate in a dim room. Regardless, it kind of feels that I've been training my brain all wrong, that I'm attaching even more than before starting my practice. I think I might have developed a thing for "seeing" the breath instead of "feeling" the breath. Then again - maybe I'm just sensing more subtle things, dunno. I think I'm gonna try continue meditating eyes open and in a well-lit environment to avoid drowsiness. If this problem continues I think I'll have to contact a teacher.</em></p>
<p>This all seems like an appropriate take on things. Just take care not to label things "wrong" or "problem". You don't know if it's wrong; you don't know if it's a problem. You only know that you don't like it. (Or do you know even that, when you're <em>in</em> the moment?)</p>
<p>It's clear that you're actually doing the practice and not just speculating, because new experiences are arising and you are engaging with them. You are using your experience and your reason to find your way. This is very different from people who spout off only about theories and dogma. Keep your curiosity and attitude of experimentation. The point isn't to have everything go the way you want or expect, the point is to look into what <em>is</em> happening and develop your supple and present mind in all kinds of circumstances. That development means you can offer your compassion anywhere, any time, not only during your favorite situations.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to share one of the aphorisms from the Tibetan <em>Seven Points Of Mind Training</em>: "Of the two witnesses, keep to the principal one."</p>
<p>You have your internal witness, and you have external witnesses like teachers, helpful writings, and experienced companions. Your internal witness â€” you â€” is the principal one. If your own wisdom contradicts what is being told to you, you have to follow what you know. Trust your own experience, just be careful not to fool yourself. Many's the time when a teacher will bring you to your own principal witness better than you could return on your own.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Yeah, community does hold a bit of that kind of stigma with me. It sounds like something one would have to devote oneself to, and drop nearly everything else, which is something I'm not willing to do. Maybe I'll try a retreat at some point, we'll see.</em></p>
<p>As to community, it's not a matter of dropping everything else and choosing community instead. It's a matter of bringing awareness into every part of your life rather than compartmentalizing it into half-hour segments (or however long "practice" is). You don't need to change who you are or what you are interested in.</p>
<p>Also, joining a community doesn't necessarily mean living together; and even living in community doesn't necessarily mean spending all your time together. These again are things you may imagine because you don't yet have experience and can't imagine anything else.</p>
<p>Many communities just meet once a week to practice together, and then offer occasional longer optional practice periods (day-long, weekend-long, or week-long retreats). No big deal, but associating with friends who are traveling along the same path can be invaluable.</p>
<p>Find your own way. I'm just sayin'....</p>
