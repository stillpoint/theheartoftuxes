<p>title: Beginner: What are you supposed to think about?
summary: 4.0
authors: TheHeartofTuxes

<hr />
<p>In watching the thought, you absolutely don't have to continue thinking it; but also you don't have to fight with it to push it away.</p>
<p>It will take some practice, some trying it out before the instructions make complete sense. This is the way things are at the beginning of anything: unclear and somewhat difficult. New forces are starting to come together in new relationships, so there's an indistinct quality and the unease of newness.</p>
<p>But there's also big energy in beginnings. If you only try sincerely, despite any unclarity and difficulty, you already call on your own resources of stability and unconditional mind -- you express the part of you that <em>just does it</em>, no matter what. That is very powerful. Going forward sincerely connects you to your own power.</p>
<p>So if you try for a while you will soon learn what it's like. Explanation can only go so far.</p>
<p>You don't need to do anything in particular with the thought-clouds. 'Don't touch'. Just keep returning to being the watcher. Then gradually the watcher will come more to the forefront of your life, and the control that thoughts have over you will diminish.</p>
<p>You may find that you need to bring yourself back to the task of watching hundreds or thousands of times in a sitting. That is correct practice. You don't need to have the idea that your mind should be blank or that the meditation should go flawlessly. We're working with the way the thinking mind <em>actually</em> moves, not an imposed ideal; and the thinking mind jumps around and clings to things and takes you away in thousands of different ways. This is the proper nature of the thinking mind. It's why thinking is useful for us, but it's also how thinking distracted us from our watcher.</p>
<p>Just watch it calmly, as if you were sitting on the side of a hill or mountain watching clouds come and go. Or watch as if you <em>were</em> the mountain that clouds are passing -- grounded, stable, calm.</p>
<p>The watcher is always stable and calm. But we become agitated in many ways because we attach to thinking. We think of ourselves as the clouds, not as the mountain. So when a <em>wanting</em> cloud appears, we think of ourselves as wanting. When a <em>nattering gossip</em> cloud appears, that's what we think we are. When a <em>frustrated</em> cloud appears, we believe that we are frustrated.</p>
<p>So in meditation you may experience all of these changes, as you will at first still believe in the clouds and attach to them. That's okay; just come back to being the watcher whenever you notice that you've gone away. Coming back is the important thing, so if you have to come back ten times or if you have to come back ten thousand times, both are correct practice, correct meditation.</p>
<p>It is good at the beginning of the meditation session to take a few deep breaths and intentionally relax. The watcher is not tense. If there is a sense of tension, that is a subtle kind of thought that is remaining, a thought that something special has to be done, made, grasped, avoided, or achieved. There's nothing special to be done; the watcher has always been there, and thoughts have always been the way they are.</p>
<p>After taking a few breaths at the start of sitting you don't have to do anything special with the breath. It can be natural. If you find that concern about how you are breathing arises, that is another thought-cloud to watch. In fact, any kind of idea about how meditation should be going is another thought-cloud to watch.</p>
<p>If for a few moments no thought appears, then just watch that space, just be aware of that nothing-in-particular.</p>
<p>There are two ways to work with problems that come up repeatedly. One is to consult a teacher for advice. The other is to trust the method and your own resources, and keep returning to the method. Often this is what a teacher would say anyway. But if there is, for example, some ongoing problem with breath or something else you can contact me and I will try to respond as best I can (or let you know when I'm not qualified to offer advice on the issue).</p>
<p>So you don't need any book. You only need to do it. More ideas are not necessary, and would only get in the way. This meditation has been described in various forms in various places, but if you run into different descriptions it could be confusing, even if each method is good in its own way. Learn by doing.</p>
<p>&gt; One time trying is better than a thousand times hearing or reading.</p>
<p>Only try, then you will get <em>your own</em> experience, which is much more valuable to you than anyone else's. When you get your own experience, then you can start to connect with the teachings and they can start to live in you.</p>
