  <h1>Being constantly aware of your suroundings and yourself is overwhelming. How do you deal with that?</h1>

<p>There is definitely a challenge particular to acting, where identifying with not only your own story but your character's is a necessity. But perhaps this only underscores the need to be clear on what <em>is</em> and <em>is not</em> the real <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>It is a shamanic path: going into the dark depths of creativity to provide a bridge for others. But the shamanic skill of returning is necessary, and that is something many artists, and especially many actors, are not so good at. After entering the dark depths you need to be able to find your way back, clean off, and reset.</p>
<p>Your work requires you to consider these things, so let's consider them carefully, meticulously:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>; does being aware of state of mind, energy, and environment necessitate attachment to "I"? No. If you make the concepts "<em>my</em> state of mind", "<em>my</em> energy", and "<em>my</em> environment", then attachment is inherent. But if you don't make any concepts, awareness can function freely.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>; is theater really the act of being insincere? Is it not, perhaps, to find a sincerity that is deeper than the changing masks? Is it not, perhaps, to offer yourself to that which will connect people in a shared truth?</p>
<p>The flexibility and smoothness of the performer's mind is is something altogether different than insincerity. The pivotal skill is to be able to transition between masks without attachment, without residue. To offer yourself to the momentary situation, and then to move on without lingering in it. A sticky mind accumulates a lot of junk; a smooth mind can move through experiences without them clinging to it.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>; you write: "...the fact that you are your own material seems to contradict the search of cutting through illusions and reaching some higher truth." Is this a fact? Are you (just) your story?</p>
<p>There at the center of meditation is the truth that you are <em>not</em> your story, <em>not</em> your masks and situations and feelings and thoughts, <em>not</em> anything that gets created or dies. The promise of correct meditation is that you see for yourself that you are none of these things. The true you is unborn and undying, pure and luminous and undisturbed by any comings or goings.</p>
<p>So in the first case, don't make or attach to concepts. In the second case, be sincere in the moment and practice moving on cleanly. In the third case, know that you are none of the manifestations in your life, and seek the Source at the center. These three — the three factors that can liberate you in your work — constitute correct meditation. They are factors that can likewise liberate you in your broader life.</p>
<p>Eckhart Tolle talks about the difference between our story and our depth. Story flows along across time, up and down and always changing, agitating. But depth is not accumulated across time; it can be conceived of as the vertical dimension in the present moment. Your depth, your meaning, is expressed in the present.</p>
<p>But while practicing presence it is not necessary to keep a tense, laser-like focus. In fact, it is counterproductive in most cases. Just to have contact with the depth dimension may be enough. You can think, you can imagine, you can use your sensitive faculties and your predictive faculties, you can wield your intuition, as long as you keep some contact with the present moment and as long as you can quickly let go and move on from situation to situation. Smooth transitions.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you check. People habitually want to <em>know</em> if they're being present, so they step outside with their attention and look back at their situation. But at that moment they are no longer being present; rather they are stepping outside and checking.</p>
<p>When performing a character, throw yourself into it. Disappear. When no longer performing a character, throw yourself into that; and disappear. Waiting for the bus, disappear as standing or sitting. There is no need to figure out whether you are doing it right or how things will turn out. Only trust your momentary activity. Perceive the moment; but if your thinking starts to attach to "my situation" and "my condition", you must let it go quickly and cleanly.</p>
<p>Have you done any ritual theater work or shamanic practice? You may find tools helpful for your line of work; in particular, training the ability to fill in life's various masks and roles without losing your essential self.
