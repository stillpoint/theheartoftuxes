  <h1>I feel lost in life with no direction. I am looking for anything to "wake" me up. Could meditation help?</h1>

<p>Meditation could help, but really your direction informs your meditation. That is, if you are clear on your direction, then your meditation can be correct and you can progress significantly with it. If your direction is unclear, then your meditation will be limited.</p>
<p>This is all the more so because you, like most of us, can't transform yourself under your own solitary power. Except for very rare, special individuals, <strong>mere will-power is not enough to sustain a discipline.</strong> And when you are saddled with slack habits and a poor self-image it will be very difficult to get yourself out of the hole through your efforts alone. Some support and external structure are necessary: the support to provide clarity and wisdom at times when you can't/won't provide it; the external structure to keep you on the path at times when you would otherwise wander off.</p>
<p>My suggestion is not necessarily to do away with the idea of meditation, because it will offer some very important benefits, but to <strong>put your focus on activity in the world.</strong> Bring yourself into meaningful situations where you can make a meaningful difference to others. Even tapering in by volunteering once a week or so at a charity where you do work with/for others in need will, I'm sure, significantly impact your sense of value and direction.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong> is very good too, for opening your view of the world and of yourself. Through travel you can see how others live, and thus gain perspective and inspiration that have to do with <em>possibility</em> in life — you can understand that life is wide open for you to choose your way. You can also understand through experience how fortunate you are... and how capable you are, as you face the many surprises and challenges that appear when you leave your cocoon.</p>
<p>Even if you don't travel, just <strong>putting yourself into new situations</strong> can provide much of the same benefit.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting truth: <strong>moving out of your comfort zone is tremendously liberating, and ultimately much more comfortable!</strong> 'I, my, me' mind is responsible for your fear and suffering. The more you focus on 'I, my, me', the more you suffer. It is a very clear equation: Suffering varies directly with self-attachment.</p>
<p>But when you are fully active, you have for those moments forgotten about 'I, my, me' thinking. You are only <em>doing</em>. Thus for those moments you don't have the suffering of worrying about what will happen, whether you will lose your comfort, whether you will be exposed, whether you can get what you want, whether you are okay, and so on and so on. When you are participating fully in activity, for that time your suffering mind goes away and your complete mind appears. Then you have the experience of being complete. It is not an idea, it is an experience you get by <em>doing</em> it.</p>
<p>So I recommend trying something new. If it is something that also helps others, this will be of most benefit in clarifying your direction in life. It will appear not as merely a theory or ideal or philosophy, but as a felt experience. By giving yourself in service, you will get your correct direction in your heart and body.</p>
<p>Next, you should <strong>try to be around 'practice people'</strong> — people who are actively working on finding truth and becoming clear and compassionate. I'm not sure TM is the best situation for this, though there may be some benefit. If you want to say what area you live in, maybe I or another redditor can recommend a place where sincere practice is happening.</p>
<p>Associating with spiritual friends can't be underestimated. I'm not talking about people who talk about spirituality or people who go to new-agey events, but about people who are sincerely dedicated to a practice. The support that you get in terms of establishing role models, gaining self-reflection, seeing how life issues are handled, receiving inspiration and encouragement, experiencing non-romantic love, feeling safe within community, and many other benefits is beyond estimation.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you can <strong>spend time with a clear teacher or enlightened being</strong>, it will provide both an anchor and a beacon for you — influences that can see you through tumultuous life when you would otherwise be at a loss. The living example of someone who has followed through on appropriate relationship and behavior in life, and who has attained the fruit of practice, is life-changing. You learn that it <em>can</em> be done — it is not just an idea written about in books or a legend from other times, but something that you yourself can attain. A teacher will also help to repeatedly correct the wrong thinking and action that cause problems for you and keep you from being happy.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong> can be very good, but it requires a life context. Other things need to be in order for meditation to be transformative; by itself it is a temporary and limited solution. Your life activity will have a greater impact at this time.</p>
<p>If you want a daily practice <em>in addition to</em> changes in lifestyle/activity, you can practice <strong><em>The Four Thoughts That Turn The Mind</em></strong>, plus five minutes of sitting or bowing meditation. The Four Thoughts are very transformative, and help you to clarify your direction in life. Millions of people, both monks and laypeople, practice the Four Thoughts every day. I <strong><em>highly</em></strong> recommend it as a regular daily practice.</p>
