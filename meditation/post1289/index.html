  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>You don't necessarily know with your thinking-understanding. That is rarely the case. You just do it.</p>
<p>Our habit of stepping outside of our situation to pinpoint and label and judge what is happening is called <em>checking</em>. That's the most common mistake of meditators: rather than just doing it, they step outside of practice to 'see how it's going'. During a meditation session, 'how it's going' is none of your business! Only do the practice as best you can. Offer yourself to the method.</p>
<p>Afterward, on occasion, you can check to consider what is working for you and what isn't, and how you can change your approach. Maybe once a week or so you can consider whether you're advancing or regressing. Or, if you have a regular practice under the guidance of a teacher, maybe you can do a very specific assessment at the end of each sitting, while your mind is still clear.</p>
<p>But the rest of the time, in meditation and in life, don't check!</p>
<p>When you <em>just do it</em>, your activity and energy radiate from your center. When you check, your activity and energy go out for a bit, then circle back in self-obsession. The circle is small and tight. That's not the correct use of your energy. Only do it.</p>
<p>Beginners often try not to be beginners. They try to be experts, controlling every eventuality. So they don't learn how to go forward clearly; rather, they practice being in their own small circle of thinking and checking, grasping and manipulating.</p>
<p>As a beginner it is appropriate not to know everything. (That's also true of an expert! But even more so for a beginner.) It is appropriate to sometimes make a mistake despite your good effort. The aim is not to know and control every possibility ahead of time, to avoid ever making a mistake. The aim is to attend to the moment. When you attend to the moment, you can quickly correct any mistake.</p>
<p>You already know yourself very well. You know that you trick yourself. But you can't cut out that bad habit like a surgical operation. This is another mistake beginners make: they think that there is some magical technique or ingredient that will make everything easy. Maybe they see a master moving effortlessly in the world, and think that they used this magical technique. But the technique that was used was consistent, never-ending effort in practice! The effort of being momentary and opening your hands, time and again.</p>
<p>If I were to talk about some 'way' of knowing when you're sincere, I would be going along with your fooling yourself. You already know. You already have a conscience. You already have wisdom. So you need to put it into practice. <em>Practice</em> returning to the moment with a non-grasping, non-manipulating mind. <em>Practice</em> not fooling yourself, by letting go of all trains of thought. Only be sincere; only do it.</p>
<p>As to motivation, that is something that gets clarified over time. It may be a life-long project: to understand and clarify and deepen the reason for living. You can clarify your motivation by returning to the question every day: "What am I here for? What is my right activity in the world?"</p>
<p>Again, don't think that you will get a thinking-style answer, one finalistic sentence that sums it all up... and that will relieve you of ever having to consider it again. No, you have to look into it and try it out in the laboratory of life, again and again.</p>
<p>One Zen Master asks new students: "Why do you eat every day?" This is one of the first questions that beginners get tested with in his Zen school. It means "Why do you bother to keep yourself alive — for what purpose?" It may be a good practice to look into this question every time you sustain your life with some food or water. "What will I do with this continued life I've been given?"</p>
<p>A life only for yourself is a suffering life. It is cut off from its original completion. Correct motivation includes everyone and everything. At first, this motivation is likely covered by all kinds of habits and conditioning. Even our parents may say things like "You have to think of yourself, because no one else is going to help you." There may be some truth to those teachings, but they lack the completion and compassion of right motivation. Your life is not <em>only</em> for yourself; it has a greater purpose.</p>
<p>What could that be...?</p>
