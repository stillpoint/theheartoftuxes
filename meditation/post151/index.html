  <h1>Thoughts on current meditation practice & technique for newbie? Too intense?</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>My friend told me that you get much more with unguided</em></p>
<p>Your friend is not necessarily a teacher. He may have some more experience, but his experience may or may not apply to your situation. You can be grateful for his advice, but you should also use your wisdom to determine if it is correct for your situation, or if you need to consult a more definitive source.</p>
<p>It's not that the meditation is too intense; but it is not what you have been learning, and its direction is not clear. Third eye and other energetic formations are not good to practice with in the absence of a teacher. Really, I don't recommend messing around with this kind of thing unless you yourself have good reason for it, and unless you are being guided by someone who can take responsibility for the evolution of your energetic system over the long run. It is quite convenient for people to say "yeah, just meditate on this or that power spot", and then ditch and run when you come up against a road block, or worse. Energy meditation is a side-route. It can be effective within a tradition, and with meticulous teaching and meticulous practice, guided by a master. It can be a load of hogwash or a nest of snakes if approached with vague guesses and self-serving agendas.</p>
<p>Third eye meditation is also not specified for social anxiety. There are better, more simple methods.</p>
<p>But it is concerning that you say you have cut girlfriends, friends, family, and hobbies all for the sake of meditation, and all for the sake of ridding yourself of social anxiety. <strong>How will cutting off society help you get past social anxiety?</strong></p>
<p>The notion that you can take yourself out of every problematic situation, then work to perfect yourself, and finally return and function without any difficulty is misplaced. It is a dream created by the ego that seeks to avoid difficulty, discomfort, and above all loss of control. This is how the shadow of spiritual pursuit arises: we imagine ourselves to be seeking the highest truth, but unconsciously our own habits are driving the process. Your own fear is convincing you of the way you should go. But really, your proper training is to start <em>entering</em> social situations, and to practice <em>relating</em> — at first with the people closest to you, including family and friends, and then ever-increasing ventures out of the old comfort zone.</p>
<p>That is how the comfort zone grows. Not by retreating to an ever more insulated situation.</p>
<p>Meditation is not a cure-all. Westerners unfortunately interface with meditation first through pop culture and then through readings, and don't have a real-life context for what it is really <em>for</em> and how it is really practiced. People think there is some magic power that develops, or that they will get special lights or sounds or visions, or that impenetrable mind power will arise. It's not like that. It's a practice of bringing yourself back to the present moment repeatedly, without fuss, without making something special, without creating masks or fantasies... and then using that returning to start expressing more wisdom and compassion in how you deal with others.</p>
<p>There's no magic formula ('third eye' notwithstanding). <em>You</em> practice putting others ahead of your selfish agendas and fearful reactions. You practice it by doing it. You do it, then do it again, then again, then again. Ten thousand times, you do it. Then you get some comfort and confidence. That's the order of things in meditation.</p>
<p>And meditation exists as one part of a balanced life. It should not become everything. When it is taught that meditation can be your whole life, it means that you can engage in a complete and balanced life, <em>with awareness</em>. It doesn't mean that you give up all healthy and enjoyable things in order to sink into a single obsessive pursuit. Doing so, you harm your evolution, your unfolding. How will you offer great, unconditional compassion if you have no experience interacting with others?</p>
<p>The language that you use, and the way you use it, betrays an isolationist intent. This is not correct meditation. Meditation is not retreat from the world. Meditation is retreat from the unreality you make with your thinking. <em>You</em> label a situation 'bad'; so it is not the situation you need to retreat from, it is your labeling that you need to let go of. <em>You</em> think of others as a problem or threat. Originally, they are not a problem; but your idea makes them a problem. So it is not the people that you need to retreat from; it is your idea that you need to let go of.</p>
<p>Always thinking "I, my, me" is very suffering. "How will I get my best situation?" "What if it gets disrupted?" "What is the fastest way to get my results?" "What if my method could be better?"</p>
<p>All of this is very uncomfortable, suffering thinking, because it all revolves around a narrow sense of self. You can help yourself by turning that energy around. Instead of always directing your energy at yourself and your thoughts and plans and your analysis of your situation, direct the energy outward. Express. Do things wholeheartedly, without expectation of any return. Clean your space or help someone without asking for any cheers or thanks. Care about someone sincerely rather than hoping that you can get something out of the relationship.</p>
<p>If you practice in this way, your outward moving energy will manifest as confidence, and your social anxiety will diminish. If you continue hovering around your own narrow situation and trying to figure out how you can benefit at every turn, the energy will not move outward but will collapse into you, and manifest as worry, shyness, and discomfort.</p>
