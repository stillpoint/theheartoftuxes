  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Patience is not only a virtue, it is one of the practical necessities of training, as well as one of the perfect qualities of enlightenment (Sanskrit: <em>Paramita</em>) that one trains.</p>
<p>So you should not expect everything to be easy and quick and just as you like it; you should offer ongoing effort, common sense, and patience to the task.</p>
<p>In speaking of posture, first of all we should look at this term 'straight'. This is maybe a mis-translation or oversimplification of a more subtle and organic issue. What is really mean is 'upright': to be sitting upright over your own structure, so that the skeleton's natural shape bears weight and transfers it straight downward, rather than holding yourself up by muscular effort.</p>
<p><em>Upright</em> and <em>at ease</em> are perhaps more useful key words than "straight", especially since not much is actually straight in the body, at least not naturally.</p>
<p>The short answer for you is that you will have to work at changing the physical limitations and bad habits that have accumulated over your lifetime. Doing it faster will necessitate more care, more effort, and likely periods of more intense discomfort. Doing it gradually will necessitate long-term consistency, patience, and still some periods of discomfort.</p>
<p>While comfort is an aim, total elimination of <em>dis</em>comfort may not be a realistic goal for many. Really, we are trying to find our comfort with reality, our relaxed and open-hearted engagement with things as they are, including all pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral experiences. So it's not that we expect to always have a heavenly feeling, but that we practice bringing <em>our own</em> inner comfort to meet each situation.</p>
<p>This shift in attitude itself communicates with the body and helps it to relax and flow and adapt. But it takes time.</p>
<p>At first, use whatever support you need to put yourself into a 'good enough' posture â€” good enough to practice enjoyable without a great deal of distraction. This will allow you to experience the pleasant aspects of meditation and start developing a positive relationship with it. If you adopt an austere mindset and push yourself too hard too soon, you may not build a foundational feeling of goodness with relation to meditation, and it will be easier for you to abandon the practice.</p>
<p>Later, once you have experienced enough positivity and benefit to keep you going through difficulty, at that juncture you can raise your standards and push through a bit more.</p>
<p>A lot of people have problems with posture not only because they have weak postural muscles and bad postural habits, but because they have little knowledge of how to achieve functional posture and little knowledge of the important points in meditation. This means that proper teaching is very helpful and in many cases pivotal. Some traditional courses of meditation training will give quite good instruction on posture, while others merely repeat rote instructions without understanding the physiology or how the mind-body connection influences posture. In the latter case it would be best to get supplementary training from a postural expert. Many meditators have found relief and progress through mindful methods like Alexander Technique, Feldenkreis, and Mitzvah Technique; others have found the combination of guidance and strengthening in Pilates and some forms of Yoga to be very helpful.</p>
<p>In any case, we shouldn't disregard the importance of physical practice as part of the whole training. If we don't take care of the body, the spirit has no good home in which to practice. On that note, balanced diet and frequent whole-body movement are influential factors in achieving comfort in sitting. The body needs activity; it needs flow. If you aren't enjoying vigorous activity every day in sports, play, or exercise, traditional physical practices (like prostrations) take on even greater importance not only in sitting comfort but in overall physical-mental-emotional-energetic ease and health.</p>
<p>Once you have learned what constitutes proper posture (there's no set position; it's more a matter of perceiving your own balance and ease), and once you have learned how to set up reliably during sittings, then you can gradually wean yourself off of supports. If you're a hard-headed traditionalist you may just sit without a cushion and let your body adjust (painfully) over the years; but for the most part a gradual approach is more suitable for new students.</p>
<p>Let's remember that some Asian teachers may nonchalantly recommend certain postures because they have been using them since birth: even if they went through painful periods in monastic training, they may have been nothing like the level of adaptation required by, say, a bulky and inflexible football player or sedentary worker in Western society. So, again, the practical approach is to realize that it will take time and proper conditions to coax the body back to a level of flexibility and strength that makes cross-legged sitting a cheerful and satisfying prospect.</p>
<p>I've written many posts on posture. You can search my posting history. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/3tbee1/does_sitting_in_lotus_position_really_matter_i/cx51usy">Here's one post</a> that includes several links on practical issues. Please read the links, because they include some vital points for how to set up sitting posture, as well as further guidance on how to progress in the physical side of sitting.</p>
