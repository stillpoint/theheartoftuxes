  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>Different situations have different reasons and outcomes. What is good teaching worth? What does the situation require?</p>
<p>I don't think charging money in itself excludes a teacher from being valid and beneficial. I would look into the situation more deeply. I would consider or even ask why the money is being charged. Some communities, in their ignorance and selfish greed, won't openly support a teacher; so in order to bring benefit to others the teacher may need to establish a different way of doing business.</p>
<p>In the West, for example, there is not the same tradition of support for spiritual leaders as in the East. People don't realize the preciousness and rarity of good teaching until they have undergone considerable training; and they don't realize what effort and resources go into maintaining a teaching center or even a personal teaching schedule, until they themselves have worked to support their community. So structures of payment (among other structures) often have to be established to ensure the continuity of the teaching, as well as to teach people what correct relationship looks like. Even outside of cultural differences, the selfishness of spiritual seekers is hard to overstate.</p>
<p>By the same token, some so-called teachers are motivated by monitary concern to some extent, or perhaps to a great degree. Rather than using fees merely as a way of ensuring the continuity of teaching, they use them to secure their own situation. This is at the least suspicious behavior, if not unethical.</p>
<p>Similar considerations go to the size of the group. Everyone has their own karma. Some people are quiet and plain, and attract few students even though their teaching is deep. Others are naturally charismatic or have a talent for speaking to the concerns of the common person. From no sinister intent or fault of their own, many people are drawn to them. Should they turn them away?</p>
<p>And then there are people who are good at manipulating. They know, consciously or unconsciously, the attachments that people harbor; and they use those attachments to gain praise and fame, fortune and influence.</p>
<p>Having a small group of students doesn't indicate that a teacher isn't profound and precious; and it doesn't necessarily mean they are sincere either. Having a large group of students doesn't mean a teacher is necessarily better than others; but it also doesn't necessarily indicate greed or sinister intentions.</p>
<p>The measure of a teacher is often not in these externals. You need to do research: look them up in a Google search; learn about their methods and why they use them; learn the teacher's lineage, who <em>their</em> teachers were; see proof of the teacher's certification.</p>
<p>You also need to take appropriate time to try out their teaching, discovering through your own genuine effort whether they hold promise (and take into account that most practices will require quite some time and effort to bear fruit). You need to witness the behavior of the students, especially the advanced students. Are they of a high standard? Are they kind and happy? Do they fold and revert to reactivity when things get challenging?</p>
<p>You need to gain evidence for the sincerity or insincerity of the teacher themselves. How do they conduct themselves moment to moment? Do they act with compassion? Do their words and actions match?</p>
<p>You have to take responsibility for your own awareness and choices. Try things out when you have sufficient cause to trust the process. Don't swallow a sales pitch out of blind admiration; but don't reject good teaching out of blind fear. Keep your eyes and mind open.</p>
<p>And most of all, you have to have <em>correct motivation</em>. Those who themselves are sincere and openhanded and compassionate cannot be easily manipulated. Those who 'have a dog in the fight' — who seek to gain special states or powers, or otherwise have selfish aims — will easily be led about... because they take the bait that's hung out for them.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is you need to know what <em>you</em> are on about.</p>
