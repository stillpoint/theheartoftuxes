  <h1>Meditation for Letting Go of Control?</h1>

<p>There are many methods of training concentration. But before that, let's talk about <em>why</em>. What is your aim? What is the best function that meditation could have in your life?</p>
<p>Concentration style is okay. In itself it isn't good or bad. The important thing is how you <em>use</em> any concentration you gain; for what purpose? I would like to suggest that meditation should absolutely align with your life purpose. The great potential of your life should be completely served by meditation, or really anything you do; otherwise you're killing time.</p>
<p>Some paths of meditation develop just enough concentration to keep the mind stable in whatever other practices are undertaken. Most <em>Vipassana</em> training goes this way, for example.</p>
<p>Other paths may rely heavily on concentration as a way of uniting with your essential nature: the mind becomes completely united with the object of meditation, and in that unity a glimpse of original nature can be had. This is a little bit 'hard style', which relies on strong effort to stay with the object of meditation. Also, strange experiences tend to arise more with intense concentration practice than in some other styles. This is because of the pressure put on the mind. Rinzai Zen style is sometimes like this, so they have teachings about the kinds of phenomena that may arise, and they urge you to disregard them as mere mental projections. I've done this style, but it is not my favorite because it's easy to start grasping and striving with subtle layers of your mind, even if you know better. But these styles work well for some people.</p>
<p>There are also paths of meditation that don't necessarily train concentration as a separate practice, but rather integrate it into their main meditation. Just by virtue of letting go of distraction you train your ability to focus; you don't necessarily have to pierce an object of concentration with laser intensity. Vajrayana Buddhism offers a lot of practices that combine physical activity, voice, and visualization (body, speech, and mind) for example, in addition to heartfelt feelings of compassion and devotion; and just doing all those at once tends to keep the mind quite occupied and less likely to wander. Much of the Korean Zen accessible in the West, although it's every bit as vigorous as the Japanese Rinzai, emphasizes keeping an open question rather than overtly trying to make concentration happen.</p>
<p>My main complaint with practices that weigh heavily on concentration is that they tend to put the cart before the horse. That is, there is emphasis on developing mental power before the container has been created for it. <em>How</em> to use that mental power correctly, in right relationship with other people, animals, environment... how to trust your spontaneous wisdom... how to find the right direction for every life effort: these should be first in priority, and should be trained in harmony with mental power. </p>
<p>Clarifying your direction comes first in priority because if you know your correct direction in life, then you can use any situation to benefit. It is like traveling: if you know where you are headed, then even tiny steps will bring you closer. But even if you have some special power, if you don't know how to use it you could easily go backward; and as we know, power itself tends to corrupt, so if your priorities aren't straight you can lose yourself in egoistic pursuits. Even some charismatic teachers fall prey to this trap.</p>
<p>So first: why? What is the correct expression of life — only for oneself? Only to get some nice things or good feeling? The correct expression of life is unconditional compassion, compassion that includes you, and those close to you, and those far from you, and even enemies and spirits and insects and earth and sky. If you have a sincere compassion as the basis of your practice, meditation will go very well for you. You will already be free of so many pitfalls that others fall into because of their self-obsession. Your mind will already be prepared to let go and settle. But if on the other hand you grasp for your own good situation, it will cause difficulty in meditation and in life. This is simple cause and effect.</p>
<p>If you'd like to tell me (us) about your aims and interests, I can offer some suggestions. Finding a live teacher would be very wonderful for you. There are many good techniques, but having a relationship with an awakened being or someone who can guide you on the path of awakening is rare and precious. If you find a living teacher, take some time to research them, spend time together, and discern whether they are teaching a good path. Then you can commit to study with them. Getting what you think your favorite style might be is not so important. Even getting the perfect fit is not so important. Does your teacher help you believe in yourself? That is important.</p>
<p>I don't know if your character is predominantly devotional, physical, mental... if you are easily distracted, if you have angry energy to use, if you connect well to simplicity or if you like lush form, and so on. All of these factors reflect which method might work well for you. But even without getting the perfect method, if you find one that has been proven in the past, and if you follow through with it even in difficulty, then you can achieve something.</p>
