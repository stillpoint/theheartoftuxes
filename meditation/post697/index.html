  <h1>Meditation space?</h1>

<p>Making the area appealing for yourself comes <em>second</em>; it's not the top priority or most important function of an altar space. The first function is to honor the awakened mind. In Buddhism, this is represented by an image of the Buddha, the one who awakened. That is you — your original mind, your true potential, and what you are heading toward. Your original mind is the mind of awakening. So you make a focal point in your living space to reflect and remind you of the focal point at the center of your life.</p>
<p>It is a reminder that although physically the altar may be just a shelf among other things in your environment, the real altar — the altar in your heart and mind — is at the center of everything; it is not just a side compartment. Everything returns to your true mind. On the other hand, everything that goes wrong and causes you suffering happens because you don't understand your true mind; so all blame returns to this central issue as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, your altar or shelf of recognition should have as its center a representation of your awakening. If you have an awakened teacher or if you have some contact or connection with an awakened being, you can also keep their image here if you like.</p>
<p>The other things that you place closest around this center can be your offerings, your way of approaching and keeping contact with your awakening mind. You may offer light and warmth in the form of a candle; you may offer pure atmosphere in the form of incense; you may offer clarity and calm reflection in the form of water; you may offer nourishing support in the form of a fruit or other clean food; you may offer beauty and aspiration in the form of a flower. You can choose what you want to offer. If you keep the shelf clean and keep the offering fresh (for example, refreshing a cup of water daily or lighting a candle once daily), then it will keep you in contact with your true center. It will work at a deep psychological level, as your deep mind recognizes that you are returning, returning, returning to your awakening.</p>
<p>You don't ever have to think "oh, this is just a shelf of stuff". If you offer your sincerity, it becomes a sacred space. You offer your sincerity there repeatedly, and then the altar will be empowered by it. It will have a life beyond mere physical objects because you have brought life to it. In the same way, when you bring life to the moment, offering your sincerity and open presence breath by breath, you reveal the moment as something more alive and real than before. You make the world into a realm of awakening.</p>
<p>The great swordsmen of Japan would practice pouring their sincere and concentrated presence into their sword practice. Then if their minds later became dull or depressed, they would only have to hold their sword and the power instilled in it would transform them. A sword thus empowered could even have a healing effect on others. Similar effects appear with <em>malas</em>, meditation beads, used by great enlightened beings: they become like medicine for others, bringing clarity and aspiration to their minds and healing to their bodies.</p>
<p>So your shelf can be a place where you instill your very highest, most pure intentions.</p>
<p>After the focal point and the inner circle of offerings to it, you can place other sacred objects on the shelf, like practice objects (e.g., a mala) or scriptures (e.g., sutras or tantras). If you have received an object from a teacher, like an image or scarf or other gift, you can keep it in a place of respect on your shelf.</p>
<p>Finally, you can offer connection with this sacred space to others. If there is someone you are concerned about or want to offer clarity and compassion to, you can put a representative object or their name or picture on the shelf, to the side. Some people keep pictures of ill or deceased family members on their altar, or objects belonging to someone going through difficulty, or even a representation of a difficult relationship (with an enemy, for instance) with the intention to bring more clarity and compassion into the relationship.</p>
<p>So the shelf is not primarily just to make you feel better, but to help you remember the path that leads beyond "better" and "worse". Your original mind is represented by the central figure. The aspect of mind that shines its light of awareness to everyone is represented by a candle or butter lamp. The aspect of mind that offers clarity and coolness and pure reflection to everyone is represented by water. The aspect of that mind that maintains virtuous activity and wafts kindness to everyone is represented by incense. The bountiful aspect of mind is represented by fruit. The purity and the unfolding potential of mind is represented by flowers. The openness of mind is represented by space. The reality ground of mind is represented by the shelf/altar itself.</p>
<p>Remember: If you seek to <em>get</em> something from the altar, it becomes disempowered and you can't get anything from it. But if you seek to offer to the altar, it will be empowered and will support you in ways you can't even imagine.</p>
