  <h1>Best meditation for calming an overactive mind?</h1>

<p>There are many forms of meditation, and many of those are more appropriately called 'concentration practice', which means distraction from the thinking mind calms down. There is no 'best' meditation, only what works for you because of your own effort and engagement. Often, the 'best' meditation is simply the one that you actually do consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Object-related concentration-style practices are aimed at calming the mind.</strong> It is not that you suppress the thinking, but that you keep one object in your attention and repeatedly let go of other objects (like thoughts, feelings, or what's going on around you). By disengaging from the disturbances of the thinking mind, time and time again, the mind is allowed to return to calmness on its own, like a lake becoming calm when the wind dies down — one doesn't thrash at the lake to try to press down the waves.</p>
<p>Some practices are specified for overthinking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast mantra practice</strong> (repeating a sacred phrase or the name of an enlightened being) provides an object to return to repeatedly; and the returning happens quickly, each time the phrase is recited. This can match the rapidity of your thoughts. In addition, you can sometimes use your voice to help you, engaging more of yourself — breath, speaking, hearing, devotion, and the emotion of the moment — to help you stay with the object (mantra) and let go of other disturbances. This should not be thought of as a battle between mantra and thinking, but rather a process of letting things be, more and more deeply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mantra practice, like most concentration practices, can bring you to a quiet place where outside influences are dimmed. This, of course, is best done at home or in a safe situation where your attention is not required elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can also use mantra for <strong>mindfulness</strong> practice, keeping it going in the background while maintaining awareness of whatever you're doing through the day. This helps calm the mind over the long term, and helps you be aware of the ways in which you attach to thoughts and outside objects and let them control you. Because you are more continuously present you have a chance to turn around the habitual grasping and avoiding that agitates your bodymind. You may even become more aware of the ways in which your lifestyle disturbs your balance.</p>
<p>But if you are doing mantra practice throughout the day you should try it out first in simple activities like walking or cleaning, to see how it affects your attention. You don't want to be driving a car, only to discover that you've blocked out all outer stimuli.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another alternative I can recommend is <strong>physical practice</strong>. These days, you have a lot of energy, activity, and focus up in the head. You need to let all that settle down lower, into the body. Practices that center energy in the belly, like Taiji, Qigong, and Bagua can help; but they are specialized <strong>energy practices</strong> that require training. An easier way is to get more physical in your life. That means both doing rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath exercise as well as focusing more on activity than on figuring and imagining — doing rather than thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prostrations practice</strong> (full bowing) is a very excellent method of quickly bringing the energy down out of the head and into the body. It may take some time to build up the strength to do many prostrations, but it is a highly respected practice, and is especially effective for overthinking and times of crisis when you can't even bring yourself to sit still.</p>
<p>Other rhythmic body-breath exercises include walking, running, cycling, swimming, and rowing; but they miss some of the focused spiritual dimension of prostrations. Still, they can be very balancing activities to include in your life. Free dance is also a very wonderful practice that embraces and expresses all parts of self — thought, feeling, physicality, relationship, and even (depending on the setting and intent) spirituality. If you can incorporate some of these activities devotedly in your life you may find some measure of control over the thinking. Eastern masters have long taught that control over the body leads to control over the mind; your physicality is your greatest anchor for the mind that wanders.</p>
<ul>
<li>A subset of physical practice is <strong>walking meditation</strong>. If you feel mantra is not for you, you can <strong>maintain awareness of your contact with the ground</strong> ('keep your mind in your feet'). Wherever you lie, sit, stand, or walk, you maintain awareness of your physical foundation, your connection with whatever is supporting you. When walking this helps you return repeatedly and quickly, just as with mantra practice. You come back to the real moment (rather than the unreal thinking) again, again, again. You disengage from distraction again, again, again. The mind then settles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other methods exist. For someone with inherent interest in understanding and awakening, <strong>self-inquiry</strong> is an excellent method. But as you have not mentioned anything else in your post it is not clear that this or other methods would suit you well.</p>
<p>It would be remiss to avoid including <strong>character development, ethical action, lifestyle influences, and correct relationship</strong> in the quest to tame the mind. You won't do it by meditation alone. If you are using your mind, speech, or action in bad ways there is no meditation that will calm your mind; you will always be fighting yourself. But on the other hand, if you turn your activity from greediness to generosity, from lust to love, from anger to compassion, then your mind will naturally settle down and be more open to meditation.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can't be putting crap into your body and senses, and then expect to be crap-free in meditation. Eating a balanced amount of (good, healthy) food, finding balance in sleep schedule, finding balance in exercise, and avoiding violent or depressing entertainment, people, and situations will help the mind to calm down to its natural flowing state.</p>
