  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>&gt;<em>I honestly felt like I achieved nirvana for a few hours</em></p>
<p>You should disabuse yourself of this ridiculous thinking. Nirvana is not achieved "for a few hours". It is a radically selfless state, not at all equivalent to or dependent on nice feelings of peace and beauty.</p>
<p>Before you use the word you should learn what it actually refers to. And that could take more than just reading about it online, it could mean your own opinions have to be gradually released and your own perception has to be gradually refined before you are able to approach the meaning of 'Nirvana'. </p>
<p>One doesn't stumble into Nirvana without tremendous and consistent effort in purifying one's character, overcoming one's habits, opinions, and deep-seated tendencies, overthrowing one's self-centered view, and absolutely perfecting qualities of generosity, compassion, forbearance, fortitude, profound wisdom, and unshakeable concentration.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I feel like since that day I've just gone backwards</em></p>
<p>Your experience was no doubt very nice; but it was all for you and all about you. And it's in the past. Gone already. When you are with the world, you are in the moment, not grasping at past states. So you can help yourself by finding a practice for being in the moment. Find a proven, traditional practice; learn it from an accomplished and verified source; learn it well; and apply it patiently, moment to moment.</p>
<p>What constitutes progress? You don't know yet. Good teaching is necessary. You seem to believe your progress has to do with getting a peaceful situation. Progress means <em>you</em> bring <em>your</em> peace forward and offer it to <em>every</em> situation. It is a practice, a mountain to climb, not a flower to pluck.</p>
<p>Someone who advances significantly on the spiritual path has the concentrative stability to be with anyone, in any situation. They have the compassion to show up for others and attend to <em>their</em> needs, <em>their</em> suffering. They have the wisdom to see all forms as empty rather than reacting to gain and loss. Outside situation does not determine their lives because they are not in it for themselves; they offer themselves to what is facing them, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>any advice on what I should do to stop my learning experience from halting?</em></p>
<p>Let go of your opinion, let go of grasping at favorite states, and get good, consistent teaching from one valid, verified, awakened source.</p>
<p>You need proper teaching to learn what 'in tune with the world' really means. You need proper teaching to learn what constitutes progress. Just getting nice feeling isn't the aim; the aim is to overcome the selfishness that clutches at nice feelings and states and runs away from uncomfortable feelings and states (and ignores what is neutral).</p>
<p>Once you begin to receive good teaching, it is important to keep receiving it. There will come a point where you think it's enough, that you can do the rest yourself; but that is just a strategy of the ego to keep its dominant position in your life. Your own attached views and habits are persistent and they try to remain persistent, so very persistent teaching is required, so that insight can begin to sink in deeper than your deep assumptions and habits. We may need to receive a good teaching five thousand times before it actually reaches us deeply.</p>
<p>And along with consistent teaching is the requirement for consistent practice: activating and actualizing the teachings, making them real. A lot of people put a lot of books in their mental backpack, but not many actually embody the teachings in their day to day life beyond maybe a few minutes of hoping for nice feeling and then calling it 'spiritual'.</p>
<p>And also very necessary is perfecting your character through relationship with others. Don't blame others for your own agitation! Everyone is suffering together; everyone (nearly) is sleepwalking and making mistakes. We are in this together. If you can't show up for and with others, that is your own weakness. It shows that you are not yet stable and compassionate enough to share deep thought and amazingly peaceful heart <em>with others</em>. It shows that you are not incredibly tuned in <em>with others</em>. Your tuning in only happens by happy accident, in the isolation of your own chosen circumstance.</p>
<p>So you need to gather these proper conditions: <strong>teacher and teaching situation; consistent practice; showing up for others</strong>. Then your stability and clarity can grow to the point where you are comfortable and free in the world. If your practice is strong, you can go anywhere. If your practice is not strong, no amount of seeking your own special situation will help you; because no external situation can do the practice for you.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here is some guidance from the greatly enlightened master Ryokan — someone who not only attained Nirvana, but embodied it thoroughly and naturally in his every activity:</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>When you encounter those who are wicked, unrighteous, foolish, dim-witted, corrupted, vicious, chronically ill, lonely, unfortunate, or disabled, you should think: “How can I save them?”</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>And even if there is nothing you can do, at least you must not indulge in feelings of arrogance, superiority, derision, scorn, or abhorrence, but should immediately manifest sympathy and compassion.</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>If you fail to do so, you should feel ashamed and deeply reproach yourself: “How far I have strayed from the Way! How can I betray the old sages?</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<strong>I take these words as an admonition to myself.</strong></p>
