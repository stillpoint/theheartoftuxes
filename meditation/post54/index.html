  <h1>What type of meditation will help with my lost/very low sex drive?</h1>

<p>Just because you have these two things going on at the same time (low sex drive and emotional numbness) doesn't necessarily mean they have a cause-and-effect relationship. You should get checked out by a doctor to see if there is some other reason for the low sex drive. Sexuality can be a barometer for many different processes, physical, emotional, mental, relational; and sometimes it serves as an early warning of (for instance) ailments that are easily treated if addressed soon enough.</p>
<p>As to emotions, the <em>willingness</em> to feel is important. It is wonderful that you are aware of this as an issue, and that you are looking for ways to address it. Many, many others sweep it under the rug; and as a result they dim the light of their lives — sometimes for the rest of their lives! So congratulations for following up on it.</p>
<p>I can recommend a few things, including a <strong>standard, traditional meditation/concentration practice like breath-counting or mantra practice.</strong> A meditation with a clear structure, a clear method, will help you in several ways: it will develop your stability and skill in being present with the ups and downs of life. These ups and downs happen in our minds, but we think of them as happening in life. When we can return reliably to the method of meditation, we can return reliably to presence even when the shit hits the fan. This will serve you well when dealing with difficult emotions — because when you open the gates of the heart you can't pre-select what will come through them.</p>
<p>Besides mental stability, a basic meditation practice can also help you deepen your sensitivity, your perception of what's going on in you. When you meditate, your own inner situation keeps coming up, so you get a chance to see very clearly what you hold on to, what you resist, and where your mind tends to go. These dynamics all have great influence on your emotional life, so seeing them clearly can have great influence on how you <em>relate</em> to your emotional life.</p>
<p>Furthermore (and not by any means ending the list of benefits) the foundations of happiness are built with meditation, so in a broad sense a regular practice will contribute to more positive emotional experience.</p>
<p>Among other activities that may be of use to you, there are more <strong>sedentary styles</strong> where the engagement, though dynamic, happens mainly through the mind and heart; and there are <strong>active styles</strong> where the whole bodymind engages. While both can be extremely beneficial, I highly recommend the latter, especially given your age and the season of life that you're passing through in the coming years. More on that below.</p>
<p><strong>Sitting In One Place styles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The very popular <strong>Vipassana</strong> meditation looks into bodymind phenomena, including emotions and physical sensations, in great detail. It aims at realizing the underlying nature of all phenomena. It would have some bearing on the issue of emotional numbness because of its very sensitive engagement with the bodymind; it may help with feeling, but it is maybe not so good at actually addressing flow — helping emotions to move in a spontaneous and healthy way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of listening or connecting with your emotional life, a good and simple exercise (and one of the few I say may be done sitting <em>or</em> lying down) is the following: <strong>Bring the attention to the center of the chest</strong>, the expanse around the physical heart. Just let the attention rest there for a while, and feel whatever is going on. Any sensation that appears may be noted and accepted; these may include, but are not limited to, lightness or heaviness, pressure, rhythm, differences in warmth, expansion, tingling, bubbling, and so on. Often just feeling this area kick-starts an emotional process. You may at times associate some of the sensations with a particular emotion — fear, anger, sorrow, love, etc. The main point of the exercise is simply to listen and provide the space for your actual inner life to appear of its own accord — to honor whatever real movement is there, and to honor the quietness or space if you don't yet feel something there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes while you listen to the area around the heart another sensation will arise strongly in another part of the body. You can at that time attend to that sensation (say, listening to a trembling in the right knee) and offer your attentive space to it until you feel ready to move the attention back to the heart. Or, yet another sensation may appear elsewhere. Sometimes you just follow the sensations around the body as they weave a story. Within the exercise, just offer your listening space to what's going on. <em>After</em> the exercise, you may take some notes and garner some realizations about how emotions and other energies are related within you.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, this exercise is just about taking a moment to listen to the heart without imposing an agenda upon it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Next, there are some traditional Buddhist meditations that both use and heal the emotions. Both <strong><em>Metta</em></strong> (Lovingkindness) and <strong><em>Karuna</em></strong> (Compassion) meditations are parts of a body of practice called the Brahmaviharas. They bring forth the boundless heart — your own emotional heart that is limitless in its reach and in its ability to nourish. In offering love and compassion to others within these meditations, you likewise reap the benefits. You discover your own bottomless source of these healing emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like <em>Metta</em> and <em>Karuna</em>, another Buddhist meditation called <strong><em>Tonglen</em></strong>, or "exchange of suffering", is also based on the faith that you already have an inexhaustible source of goodness. By offering to exchange your very best cool, bright, and clear energies for the hot, dark, murky suffering of others you very soon realize your own big heart.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <em>Metta</em> and <em>Tonglen</em> meditations are described in many places online and in books you can find in the library or in your local book store. Slight differences in the instructions don't tend to be significant.</p>
<p><strong>Moving The Body styles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are drawn to the former practices, that's great. But <strong>I would most recommend a movement practice</strong> for you, something that involves the body, the breath, the mind, and the emotional heart <em>all together</em>. Free dance/ecstatic dance/conscious dance and other wholistic movement practices are very, very effective for your situation. By their very nature they encourage integrity rather than separation: instead of feeling (or not feeling) something, thinking about something else to do with it, and reflecting something else altogether with the body, these movement practices bring all parts of you into alignment. In dancing your own dance you learn to trust what moves through you and harmonize with it. Everything becomes grist for the mill: you can experience and express the most delicate and the most raging emotions. And then you can <em>move on to the next thing</em>. That is very wonderful, to be able to move on to new life.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a young guy, I can hardly think of anything that contributes to emotional intelligence and flow better than free-dance practice. [By free dance, I mean dance that comes from within you rather than trying to follow steps given to you by someone else.] It has the added benefits that it is fantastic aerobic exercise (thus addressing some possible physical causes of your difficulties), it deepens the brain-body connection, it <em>immediately</em> helps emotions and energies flow, and it is awesome FUN!!</p>
<p>Each of the following movement practices is wonderful, and they are all quite different from each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bodymindcentering.com/about">Body-Mind Centering</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.5rhythms.com/">5Rhythms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.authentic-movement.org/">Authentic Movement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check out your local ecstatic dance jam or "barefoot boogie" if you want to dip your toes in the water. Just be aware that practices like 5Rhythms have very pertinent teachings and very expert teachers that a dance jam can't come close to duplicating.</p>
