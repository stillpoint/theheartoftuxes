  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I think this will be very wonderful for you. From what I hear in your comments, Musangsa could be an excellent choice.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I noticed this includes between eight to ten hours of meditation per day, is it all in sitting practice or also walking? how well did you appreciate it with your previous meditation experience and such?</em></p>
<p>There is a complete and holistic training during these retreats, not only sitting. Of course, sitting meditation will be important; but also walking, bowing, chanting, eating, working, and resting are included in daily practice. It is your chance to look into your mind very simply and purposefully throughout all kinds of daily activity.</p>
<p>In my experience, if you are inspired by Dharma, nothing could be better than this precious opportunity. Usually after the first few days or so you unify with the rhythms of practice, and you take on a timeless sort of presence, joining with others in a powerful river of practice. It may or may not be noticeable for the participants, but for someone coming in from the outside, the Dharma light is seen shining brightly -- the clear presence is palpable. It's quite inspiring and uplifting.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Do you know when the spring - 3 month session starts? 
http://www.musangsa.org/english/sub04/sub04_6.php
on this link I can see the latest date starts at 28th of January but my vacation starts around April. But well maybe I can join a shorter program then if it is not available at that time.</em></p>
<p>I don't know exactly when it starts. Please contact the temple.</p>
<p>Kyol Che is a three-month retreat, and usually there is a particular day of the week when you can enter. You might be able to catch the tail end, which is great in itself -- even a week or so will be a very special experience in your life.</p>
<p>But arriving after retreat could actually be ideal for you, too. There is very clear daily practice at the temple; so you will indeed get training. And there's something to be said for tapering in, learning the style more gradually, encountering all these clear beings after their retreat, practicing regular life in the context of strong Dharmic purpose, and receiving teaching in both formal and casual ways.</p>
<p>Having a bit more self-directed time during the days, you could choose to leave it unstructured and do writing, sit in solitary meditation by the mountain pond, visit with the monks and nuns or help them in their work.... Our you could choose to commit to special practice, as visitors and residents often do, and spend, say, an hour every afternoon doing prostrations or chanting.</p>
<p>It is possible that after a period of residential training you may be able to catch the first weeks/months of the <em>spring Kyol Che</em>! That could be an exceptional way to cap your stay.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Regarding the USA and Europe is mostly because I want something raw, something that this temple seems like.</em></p>
<p>Since you are able and willing to travel, you may want to coordinate with Musangsa about your stay, and arrange to visit another temple for a week or two as well. There are many options in Korea, including a temple in the same school in Seoul city (Hwagyesa), which also has English-speaking teachers.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>P.S what about physical activity? It doesn't seem to offer much time to keep the body sharp in the process, anything in the direction of tai chi?</em></p>
<p>The day starts with 108 prostrations (I recommend tapering up to 108 before your trip, to avoid having painful 'jello legs' for the first week of your visit.) If you need more, special practice can be 500 or 1,000 prostrations per day, or whatever number you choose -- usually in sets of 108 interspersed throughout the day, though I and some others used to do them all in one set.</p>
<p>Prostrations are an incredible practice that brings the energy down out of the head and into the <em>dantien</em>. It is a tremendous whole-body exercise that contributes to health in many ways. (I've written at length about prostrations and physical practice many times. You can search my posting history.)</p>
<p>There is also walking meditation and work practice, which is often physical. If you feel the need for more activity you can ask to be assigned to something vigorous, and if they are able they might find you something like raking leaves or shoveling snow.</p>
<p>In my experience there was no formal martial arts or yoga training, but some of the nuns, monks, and other residents practice these things, and you can hook up with them or do it in your own time. I often -- usually -- use my break time during retreats to do movement.</p>
<p>On 'off' time, after retreat and at a time of day when work periods are over, the monks, nuns, and lay-participants are not averse to helpful programs or just enjoying movement. At one point, I believe morning or evening yoga was offered as an option, depending on whether a teacher or practitioner was staying at the temple. If you know Tai Chi, maybe you can invite others to join you.</p>
<p>There is a joyful, light-hearted energy to the community, besides their very serious commitment to Dharma.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>For anyone else reading, authentic monastic retreat and residential training is also available in the US.</p>
