  <h1>Strange Sensation While Meditating</h1>

<p>There is definitely ego involvement in meditation. The 'small self' not only tries to stay alive, it tries to <em>know</em> that it will always stay alive.</p>
<p>So there is a very strong, deep, automatic motive force toward staying separate from experience, checking and labeling your experience, and maintaining a self-image that takes precedence over everything else (including, say, reality... healing... peace of mind....) For example, peace of mind takes a back seat to the <em>image</em> of oneself as a peaceful meditator; actual surrender is abandoned, and maintaining the self-image of a daring or expert practitioner becomes the foremost agenda.</p>
<p>The way this egocentric activity appears in meditation is through the habit of checking and the habit of manipulating. Rather than entrusting oneself to the method and process, one takes frequent peeks to judge and compare: "How am I doing? Am I getting it? Have I become great? Am I better than so-and-so? Is this comfortable enough? Is this too much? What if I keep going in this direction? What if I change one step in the method? Can I go faster?...." And so on, and so on. This is checking.</p>
<p>Next, one tries to actually apply the checking, and manipulate one's situation. This is the small self trying to gain and hold control over how things go. We know rationally that this is not possible, but this kind of knowing is not enough; it is a very deep habit to try to make things come out a certain way. It is because one hopes to avoid the uncertain, and to avoid the abandonment of the small self. It is an existential terror: because of the illusion that the small self exists, one experiences terror at its loss.</p>
<p>But the only thing one loses is illusion. Everything real remains.</p>
<p>It is the agenda of the small self to maintain control of the thinking mind. So it will send all kinds of material your way, to attract your attention, receive your power, and derail the process of letting go. Sometimes mere trivial thought will do it -- the meditator will follow pointless thoughts down long trails, until realizing her/she has gone off.</p>
<p>But a meditator may have enough awareness to fend off these 'hooks in the water'. Then the illusory self ups the ante, dropping more tantalizing bait. Whatever moves your mind, that will be what's projected by the false self. If you are in spiritual process, it may drop the bait of spiritual attainment. All sorts of magnificent and dramatic sensations, visions, insights, and other experiences may appear. Fine, but that is not meditation. If one attaches to these objects of mind, one abandons the process of letting go. The surrender is halted (which is just what the illusory self wants).</p>
<p>If these strategies don't work, discomfort may appear, or negative visions, or perhaps urgent thoughts about work or relationships, or strong and sweeping feelings of love, fear, and so on. It is all mind. The correct response is open awareness. Openhanded, not manipulative. Meditation doesn't try to hold or avoid or arrange (which is the activity of the false self); it only sees.</p>
<p>Experiences of boundlessness may or may not appear. Sometimes they have some authentic basis, sometimes they are like dreams. In any case, your job is the same: keeping openhanded awareness in the moment. So only return to the method, don't try to arrange things by yourself, as that would be egocentric activity.</p>
<p>When you're <em>within</em> the boundless state, it doesn't feel like anything. There's no you and no 'other', no thought, no feeling. So there's no amazing or fearful event. But in the <em>approach</em> to that state, the small self may hold on tightly with a white-knuckle grip. That's where there fear comes from. </p>
<p>Don't worry, if it were that easy to get rid of the false self, people wouldn't have to do hard training to get enlightened. It will come back. Even after the illusion is upended, you will be able to use the 'self' for interaction and benefit. Just look at all the great enlightened teachers in the world. They are all very embodied, very unique, very alive. They are not hampered by self, but can use it freely.</p>
<p>So don't make ideas of higher or lower. Don't attach to experience in meditation. Recognize them all as appearances in the mind (actually, appearances <em>of</em> mind). Only return to the method.</p>
<p>That brings us to the next teaching point: you have to be clear on the method you are using. If you keep changing according to your ideas or whim, you will be practicing ideas and whim, not meditation. 
Therefore you need to choose a method that you can have faith in -- one proven by many meditators and masters, and one that you understand and have learned well, and one that you apply meticulously. </p>
<p>Then you will not be fooled by appearance. When appearance comes, you will not be led away from the method. Because it is the method that brings you to threshold of awakening (and then something beyond method takes over).</p>
<p>There's this popular notion that one can figure out a perfect method that will not only be effortless but will lead one straight to greatness. That's an adolescent fantasy. The difference between the common person and the great masters hinges on one main point: the great ones actually <em>do</em> the practice. They let go of self-concern, complaint, grasping... they repeatedly generate a compassion for all beings... and they do the practice for the sake of all others, moment by moment, day by day, year by year.  That's pretty much it. Don't touch; only do it.</p>
<p>If you want to do self-inquiry, then learn the method and do it. But don't get fancy with your own ideas, trying to improve on what the enlightened masters pass down. That is just ignorance. Maturity unfolds when you do the practice faithfully, allowing the greater power to do it, not by trying to tweak things with your small understanding.</p>
<p>In self-inquiry, you need to make friends with Unknowing. The open question does the work. Don't fixate on a notion that there's an actual <em>thing</em> to be found (the 'self' or the 'source').</p>
<p>The unaccomplished are all starting from ignorance, so the unaccomplished shouldn't invent their own practice. Learn a proven method and follow it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
