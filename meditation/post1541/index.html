  <h1>How do you meditate "on something"?</h1>

<p>&gt; Other then that I am trying not to think too much about the purpose of meditation, as I find it can taint the experience. What is your take on that?</p>
<p>There is an important distinction here, between on the one hand being goal-oriented and thus tainting the meditation with striving and judging, and on the other hand having a clear direction. I think it's good that you don't think too much about the purpose of meditation, and you just get down to <em>doing it</em>. That's wonderful. But usually people have a whole constellation of wants and intents behind their doing, whether those wants and intents are explicit or whether they arise vaguely and unconsciously.</p>
<p>These wants and intents comprise one's direction â€” why one makes the choices one makes, why one does anything in life. And unless one looks into it purposefully, the overwhelming, vast majority of wants and intents are expressed as "for me". That is, whatever we do in life, we are trying to get something for ourselves. Power, control, sensual pleasure, peace, relief, stillness.... Neither of these is good or bad in itself; but if the pursuit of it is only "for me", that makes the mind small, sets up a false dichotomy between the self and what it seeks, and perpetuates the illusion of a self that needs something outside in order to be complete. But in fact, you are already complete and you already have everything.</p>
<p>So the direction of "for others" or "not only for me" is a very significant shift. It is the shift that aligns the mind, the will, and the action properly in meditation and in broader life. If practice is "for me", then when desired results don't appear disappointment sets in and the will flags. If practice is "not only for me", the energy of practice can continue, not depending on gain and loss.</p>
<p>So we are here for a greater purpose than just to be temporarily more comfortable.</p>
<p>I also deal with chronic pain. I want to encourage you to find a way to keep practicing, and let nothing be an obstacle. If you need to change positions, change positions. If you need to change your method, change your method. There is no such thing, really, as "makes it hard to keep meditating"; there is only <em>this</em> experience, then <em>this</em> one, then <em>this</em> one, on and on in an ever-unfolding stream. How interesting! Before, I was comfortable; now there is pain here â€” <em>what is that like</em>?</p>
<p>I heard of one monk with an injury that prevented him from sitting comfortably through the long meditation periods with the other monks, so although he would he would attend the sittings he would sometimes have to leave to continue his practice through walking meditation, and he would also do walking meditation during rest periods between sittings. Far from criticizing him for his poor sitting, the other monks praised him for his effort. Difficulty doesn't need to be a hindrance. Find a way to continue practice.</p>
<p>Object-based concentration style meditation is one way of dealing with pain. As concentration on the object grows, the mind withdraws from other stimuli, and often even intense pain can be overcome. I personally don't like this style because I don't like shutting off parts of life. There is also a risk of setting up a competitive dynamic between meditation and pain, rather than training in acceptance and letting the mind be broad enough to include everything. But if one's direction is clear, concentration style can be very helpful.</p>
<p>When the aspiration is strong, some meditators find that pain actually spurs them on to deeper practice. Realizing that all of life involves some form of pain, the will may arise to finish the whole job of clarifying life and death. This contributes a great deal of energy to spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Another strategy for pain is to inquire into it. Rather than trying to avoid or distract yourself from the pain, turn your attention to it. Perceive its ever-changing quality. Find where it stops and where it starts, find its boundary in the body (if at all), look into it with curiosity and precision. This is a form of <em>Vipassana</em> or <em>insight</em> practice. As you look into the pain you find that there is nothing you can put your finger on, nothing you can grasp or define. The pain, as with any phenomenon that arises in or outside of the self, is ever-changing and empty. This insight, directly perceived, has the nature of awakening; it is already a kind of enlightenment, and when realized fully it liberates you from suffering of any kind (although not necessarily from the raw experience of pain).</p>
<p>With both concentration style and insight style meditations it is possible to enter the meditation so deeply that an effortless concentration is revealed. At that point, it is often the case that pain simply dissolves, almost magically.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Buddhist tradition puts a great emphasis on what they call <em>Bodhicitta</em>, or the mind of enlightenment. It means cultivating a generous, compassionate, offering heart in all phases of practice. So there is a formal "offering of merit" before and after meditation, where the practitioner voices the intent to offer the benefits of practice to all beings everywhere. This is a formal expression of "not only for me". It helps the mind be big enough to embrace and digest any experience, including all kinds of pain and suffering. "Whatever I go through, let it be useful for others."</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
