  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I often meditate when I'm traveling, whether in a plane, bus, car, or train. I do it because I'm happy for the opportunity to relax, be myself, and get clear for a while, without having to be busy all the time.</p>
<p>If I'm driving I require a method that has more of a physical grounding rather than mental imaging (so I can pay attention to the road). This, I think, would be a very good method for you. You can be as focused or as diffuse as you like with your attention; so it's very adaptable to various conditions.</p>
<p>First, it's good to set up the posture comfortably. Don't slouch, but otherwise be comfortable. I like to think of the nobility of a great mountain, like Mount Fuji: the base is absolutely solid, and the upper part wafts upward into space. Very stable, very dignified, very settled. You know, a mountain always finds its stability; whatever is precarious soon finds its way downward. So our posture can be like that: whatever is held in the head or body can be released and offered downward to gravity.</p>
<p>So this is another good chance before getting into the method itself, to scan down through the body and notice what is gripped in tension and anticipation, and let it soften and release downward. Relax the scalp and brow, eyes and ears (and vision and hearing), relax the face and neck, the shoulders, chest and upper back, relax the arms and hands, let the belly and internal organs soften, relax the legs and feet, and finally feel the whole body-and-mind settling down into its place like a mountain. Not crumpled, but settling.</p>
<p>If you have trouble distinguishing relaxation from tension, you can briefly tense your bodyparts and then release them. Clench for a second or two, and then release for five or ten seconds.</p>
<p>After this, the body should have found a relatively relaxed but self-supporting position, and the belly should be soft. You can then bring your attention to the movement of the breath in the belly, specifically to the lower belly, centered on a point a couple of finger-widths below the navel. If you want to help bring attention to this area you can keep your hands in circular meditation posture in your lap, edge of the hands against the belly with the circle framing the area of attention. Or you can place your hands one atop the other flat against the belly, to feel its movement, with the palms lining up over the area of focus. This second way actually helps you feel self-contained (and helps add energy to the body if you have warm, energetic hands). It is a good position if you feel your mind and energy are flying off or threatened.</p>
<p>The rest of the method is to feel the rising and sinking of the breath in that area. This promotes both calming and focus, it brings you into harmony with your own rhythm, and it helps bring your energy down out of the head where it causes trouble by agitating thoughts.</p>
<p>Breathing naturally and following the breath here can be very calming and enjoyable. As I said, you can do this practice sort of in the background, keeping part of your awareness on the lower belly as you go about other activities like walking, reading, talking, etc.; or you can bring all of your attention to bear on that area, which gives you somewhere very clear to return to when your thinking threatens to take you away and spin into anxious stories. Any time you find yourself going away in thought you can very gently and very immediately return to feeling the movement of the lower belly.</p>
<p>Being taken away by thought will happen. It is our karma, our mind habit caused by many previous conditions. You may be taken away for a few seconds or a few minutes, or longer. That is no problem. Just, as soon as you recognize it, return. Gently and instantly, without fighting or blaming or trying to check for reasons, just return. It is important not to create more thoughts by fighting with yourself; so both effortless returning and instant returning are important. The more you practice this, the stronger your ability to return will become; and this is your great power: the ability to let go of a train of thought that is controlling you, and return to neutral, return to being self-possessed, return to reality.</p>
<p>The returning helps you. So rather than being frustrated at how many times you have to return, you can be grateful for the opportunity to practice it. But in any case, just very simply come back to attention at the belly.</p>
<p>If you find that at some point you don't know how to find the movement of breathing, i.e., that you don't know how deep in the body your attention should go, just bring attention to a small point or circle on the surface, two fingers below the belly. If you have some Tiger Balm or Rub A535 or other warming/tingling balm you can put a small dot of it on the spot where your attention is directed. After some time practicing you won't need it any more.</p>
<p>Having thoughts or feelings or other experiences is no problem. These things are meant to move, to flow on their own. You can let them be and not worry about them in any way. No need to get involved trying to control or reject them. Only stay with your area of attention; and if you happen to be taken away, once you realize it simply return. It is a very faithful, open-handed approach. You're not holding a baseball bat in your hands when you meditate, to fight parts of yourself; you're being a mountain, which is stable and satisfied as it is, regardless of the weather that passes by.</p>
<p>If even this structure of practice is not enough, and your thinking mind too frequently takes you away, you can add some meditative phrases. These have a few functions: they use the word-making part of the mind skilfully to bring you back to attention rather than away in trains of thought; they provide more structure to keep you engaged; and they help regulate the timing of the breath. (More on the phrases below.)</p>
<p>When you become agitated, body, mind, and breath all tend to tense up and cling. Meditation is based in mind; but you can use the body and breath to help the mind. The rising and sinking of breath in the belly can be a constant invitation to relax, settle, let go of stress. The breath pattern usually associated with stress and anxiety is tight, fast, and emphasizing the in-breath; so turning this around can help settle you. In this practice the breath is invited to slow down and be longer in the out-breath.</p>
<p>It is very important not to <em>force</em> your breath by fighting with it; but you can <em>invite</em> it to be just a little bit more calm, a little bit longer. You know how you let out a sigh of relief? This shows the relaxing aspect of the out-breath. Each inhalation can bring with it a sense of being present: "I am here." Each exhalation can bring with it a sense of release: "Okay...."</p>
<p>So if you want, you can use these phrases as well as focusing your attention on the lower belly.</p>
<p>Breathing in, repeat to yourself "I am here, I am here, I am here...."</p>
<p>Breathing out, repeat to yourself "Okayyyyyy......"</p>
<p>The "Okayyyyy..." should be about twice as long as the three repetitions of "I am here". (Inhaling) <em>I am here I am here I am here</em> (exhaling) <em>Oookayyyyyyyyy....</em></p>
<p>Whether your breath is fast or slow at any time, whether it is deep or shallow at any time, try to keep this pattern. You don't have to keep it rigidly or exactly, but just make the invitation to your breath to relax a little bit more on every exhalation. If you breath is so fast that the "I am here" part feels rushed, you can use just one rather than three repetitions; but still try to coax the exhalation to be a bit longer and to have a bit of relaxation in it.</p>
<p>As I say, you don't have to use the phrases, but if you want to add them for support you can do so at any time. Different (but similar) phrases are used in a particular Zen school's method; and if you are interested in that I can forward it to you; but then you absolutely need to choose one method and stick with it rather than trying to figure out which one you like better.</p>
<p>So this is a practice that should serve you well in your travels. It can be used practically throughout your entire day as a grounding mindfulness practice, or as a method to relieve anxiety for a few minutes at a time, and also as a way of waking up, as a formal meditation sitting on a mat and burning incense, and as a preparation for sleep.</p>
