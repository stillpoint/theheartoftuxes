  <h1>Aware of awareness</h1>

<p>Meditation is just real, not special. So with tongue in cheek I can say that I'm sorry the results of your meditation are amazing; hopefully that will improve, and the results of your meditation can just be real.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you are trying to be aware of awareness. The background to your understanding and approach is important; and your aim or intent is very important.</p>
<p>Also, why do you think it is a feeling?</p>
<p>Awareness is always active, everywhere. It's just that for most of us most of the time something is covering it up or distracting us. Our attachment to the thought and imagined objects of the mind takes hold, and we enter the illusion of non-awareness. When the sense that "I am here and the world is out there" is overcome, awareness just <em>is</em>; no special effort to drum it up is necessary.</p>
<p>The notion of becoming "aware of awareness" may refer to an experience meditators have when they approach or come out of an experience of merging, of unity. It's a sort of reflected thought, or looking back at what just happened. Since one is very close to the state of unity one can perceive the difference between unity and the illusion of separation. So one can understand the true nature of the separate self: the self is used to function, relate, and distinguish, but originally it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>But this kind of 'aware of awareness' is a subtle thought. It is an idea or impression, not awareness itself. There is only one awareness, and it only perceives (or is ready to perceive). So in this sense awareness, which is your original mind, is like a mirror that only reflects. If something appears, it appears in the mirror. If nothing appears, nothing appears in the mirror. The mirror doesn't reflect itself.</p>
<p>Or it is like your eye. Your eye only looks out; it can't see itself. In order to see 'your eye' you have to see its image in a mirror or photo. So awareness of awareness is like that: near the edges of a unified experience something may cause a reflection — something may show you that the whole universe is awareness, and that your mind is the whole universe. But it is not something that you get by trying to get.</p>
<p>For example, one Zen Master was enlightened when he was sweeping and a rock got thrown against a bamboo plant. The sound it made penetrated his mind; he had an experience of unity with the sound, but then also immediately became clear on the nature of the self that had seemed to be there. The experience reflected insight for him. But this person was not trying to make a state or feeling appear; he was only practicing. Therefore his mind was ready for the event.</p>
<p>You don't make anything happen in your practice; and you can't step outside to have a peek. Your task in meditation is one way only. Only do it. Your practice, your effort, your sincerity, your energy only move out from your center. If you try to turn it around to look at yourself, that is creating a dualism — splitting your mind so you can have a peek, to see how it's going, to judge, to label, to satisfy the ego's fear. This is called 'checking'. Checking is the foremost mind sickness of meditators (and of the general public). This desire and habit to step outside of your real activity so you can have a look at yourself. If you consider it, you can easily understand that you can't ever really see the one who is looking; the looking only goes one way.</p>
<p>So your meditating job is only one way. Only be the witness. Only be the awareness. In a sense, it is the easiest thing you could possibly do, to simply rest in your already aware nature. In action, though, we find it difficult due to our checking habit.</p>
<p>So don't check results. Don't check feeling. Don't try to get any particular feeling or state. Don't attach to any experience whatsoever. Only practice awareness; be the aware center.</p>
<p>When you see images of saints from all cultures you will often see a halo or aura around them. Both energetically and symbolically, this attests to the radiant, center-out direction of their practice. The saint lives at the center; we practice at it.</p>
