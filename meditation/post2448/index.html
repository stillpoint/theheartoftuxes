  <h1>What kind of Meditation am I doing and how could I refine my techniques into a single school of thought?</h1>

<p>That's great that you realize a mish-mash of hand-picked practices aren't really getting you anywhere. Not everyone does realize it; in fact it's common for people to think themselves capable of guiding their own practice, even though they are just starting out. The name for this is self-delusion through arrogance. So is very fortunate that you see through this and have a chance to take the steps necessary for real progress.</p>
<p>So the main question is “What is real progress?" What would constitute “getting somewhere"?</p>
<p>Just as knowledge about how meditation works and how to do it is incomplete in the beginning and grows gradually over months and years, view of the true purpose of meditation also usually starts small and needs to mature into something far different, far greater.</p>
<p>It's fine to enjoy the feeling of meditation, and it's fine to seek out temporary personal gains from it like stress relief, improved concentration, mental health, and so on. These are all positive motivations. But they have two things in common that are very limiting: they are all temporary, and they are all self-serving. So, positive motivations, but very limited. That means that your meditation will, of course, be very limited.</p>
<p>You can build on your very fortunate awareness. You can make use of it and keep it from going to waste. Learning a broader and deeper view will help your meditation become a path rather than just another thing to do. It can become part of a practice that is not temporary, but lasting. It can become part of a practice that is not just for you but for all people, animals, and even supportive of the earth and water and sky.</p>
<p>Temporary practice goes up and down, and it comes and goes. When it depends on what you like and don't like, there will always be disappointment around the corner, and there will always be something else that catches your fancy and causes you to give up; so real progress is not possible unless you go beyond temporary practice. Some small benefit is possible, and that benefit will always be part of your life experience, but it won't have the power to transform you and take you to lasting happiness, not to mention happiness for others.</p>
<p>So you have a precious opportunity here.</p>
<p>The condition that goes along with that precious opportunity is that no one can tell you how it should unfold for you. Very precious things aren't dealt with just like that, in one fell swoop. These things take dedication, effort, time. If they didn't, they wouldn't be precious.</p>
<p>You need to go slow and do your own research. It may take many months or years to find your home path and teacher. Or it may come to you out of the blue, by virtue of your sincerity. One can't say which path is more fortunate. We may have an idea that quicker is better, but we shouldn't disrespect the value of trying and seeking, learning to go beyond disappointment, learning through personal effort, and encountering life through long-term spiritual devotion. These things are also valuable. Irreplaceable, in fact.</p>
<p>So no one can say whether finding your path sooner is better than finding it later. If you are sincere, then everything you do is already your path.</p>
<p>There are many schools and traditions that employ breath-based meditation and mantra. Some schools that one thinks of as 'sitting-only' may have an abundance of other practices available once you dig deep enough. Many good, lasting, traditional paths have value; many have produced enlightened beings. Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and other paths have all produced remarkable beings that have done their light to the world. The issue is how to distinguish proper teaching and how too find a good teacher. That is a topic we can talk about more (much more!), but just know that you need to learn these things over time, through your own effort and investigation. Then you can nurture your “most precious thing" and help it grow.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you like, I can make specific recommendations. We just don't know whether they'll end up being your right way. If you want recommendations, let me know where you live, and we can see what kind of practice opportunities and teachers might be available in your area.</p>
