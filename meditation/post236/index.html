  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>I don't talk about my personal practice, but I can say something on the topic from the perspective of Mahayana Buddhism, and especially Vajrayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>Attachment to special powers and states is a very seductive and gripping obscuration. Even if one's hope for power isn't grand, the subtle desire to become more special than others or gain some kind of leverage over them is a negative intent that ruins the purity of practice. <em>Countless</em> people through the ages have fallen prey to egocentric grasping while giving lip service to self-improvement or spiritual unfoldment.</p>
<p>(See the thrilling story of Milarepa, who started out as a dark, malevolent sorcerer and eventually through the guidance of his teacher became a great saint.)</p>
<p>A Buddhist knows (or should know) that any self-centered view or intent is inherently poisoned, and leads to suffering for oneself and others. This is because the notion of self is already a delusion. All trouble we cause in the world comes from this one misunderstanding of who or what we really are; which is why the <em>Seven Points Of Mind Training</em> states "Drive all blames into one"; that is, see all problems as rooted in attachment to the notion of selfhood.</p>
<p>But if we turn that deluded view around and move in the direction of insight into self, and in the direction of awakening and fulfillment and complete relief of suffering for all beings, then the acquisition of power has a completely different meaning and effect. So not only can the door open to pursuit of power, in paths that generate great compassionate vow for the sake of infinite beings, one actually vows and intends to develop <em>all</em> supernatural powers in order to benefit others.</p>
<p>It is not only a whim or personal decision, but a solemn vow and contract with one's lineage and master to attain the <em>siddhis</em> (mystic powers) of great enlightening beings.</p>
<p>We should realize that 'supernatural' powers are just activities that are unusual to us and that we don't yet understand. To an infant, their parent seems to have many magical powers: the ability to manifest food, the ability to appear from some other place, the ability to communicate in extremely sophisticated ways by making sounds with the mouth, etc. To a toddler, the ability to tie shoes may seem otherworldly.</p>
<p>And among adults, there are some who seem to be exceptionally perceptive, have astounding memories, or have incredible ability to manifest wealth. Although the notion of 'the supernatural' may not fit in with our personal philosophy, we nevertheless encounter many abilities that seem astounding and, so far, inexplicable.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who meditates with any depth will encounter new perception, intuition, or other 'special energy' type experiences. All these things come from mind. Some (many) are illusory projections that arise when age-old patterns of mental suppression start to be relaxed and released. But some are authentic.</p>
<p>For example, there is a very broad spectrum of what we call 'concentration': at one end is the first hint of ability to return from distraction; then as one progresses in the training, greater concentrative power arises, in which one can become very clear and present with the object of concentration. This develops further into states of absorption and complete unity -- subject and object 'become one'.</p>
<p>The upshot of this spectrum is the movement from effortful <strong>concentration</strong>, in which one <em>brings</em> the attention back to the object (back to an actual present and real thing), through <strong>intuition</strong>, in which ones intimacy with reality grows and is expressed more in one's daily activity, to <em>perception</em>, in which one sees reality directly, instantly knowing many things that others are blind to.</p>
<p>It is the great vow of Bodhisattva aspirants to travel the entire length of that spectrum, and to develop all other beneficial powers for the sake of sentient beings.</p>
<p>The basis of it all is love and compassion. For instance, when holding his baby son or daughter, a father may feel very deeply a vow arise in him: "I will do whatever it takes to benefit you. I will be the best man I can be for you." This is an aspect of the same loving mind, only the Bodhisattva has that love for <em>all</em> beings, independent of family, creed, race, species, and independent of others' friendliness, neutrality, or hostility. This love and intent is regenerated and perfected to an exceptional degree. It never stops being increased.</p>
<p>So the Bodhisattva aspirant develops all kinds of abilities to benefit others. At first, maybe for many years or lifetimes, one must become self-sufficient and very capable in the world, so as not to ever burden others or have to comprise one's values. Also, common human powers are honed and made exceptional: even-mindedness and non-reactivity even in times of great strife or danger; concentration; constant joy; tireless effort; tremendous patience; ever-growing wisdom in alignment with reality; and so on.</p>
<p>Then as one's practice moves into more rarefied territory, which relatively few have achieved, unusual abilities may start to become accessible.</p>
<p>On occasion, by reason of their karma, it sometimes happens that common people will possess one or another of these abilities without having trained in meditation and other practices. This is where we find prodigies and geniuses, like Mozart or Einstein or someone with intuitive or psychic ability.</p>
<p>The practitioner who loves all beings as her children or parents may take a vow to endlessly develop all beneficial powers for the sake of others.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><em>Siddhis</em> are categorized in two types: <em>general siddhis</em> are extraordinary abilities; <em>ultimate siddhi</em> is complete enlightenment.</p>
