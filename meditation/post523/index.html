  <h1>Importance/meaning of hands facing up and interlocking with knees?</h1>

<p>The postures both express and bring about certain aspects of mind -- your original, awakened mind. For people who are practicing at a fairly gross (say, clumsy) level the effects will not be so noticeable to them; but the effects are still there. As one advances deeper into refined states the effect and meaning of the mudras (hand postures) and asanas (body postures) can be perceived directly.</p>
<p>It is not that difficult to understand the meaning of posture. We just tend to ignore and deny it. We prefer to think that our own world of thinking is most important. That's just ego at work; but it obfuscates simple truths. Even many experienced meditators are not very connected with their body and its simple truths.</p>
<p>Consider what meditation is like if you hunch your shoulders and clench your fists tightly. Try it. Its meaning can be immediately perceived: closed, resistant, grasping, perhaps angry.</p>
<p>Next, try slumping with an open mouth and hands that just flop limply. Immediately you can feel the dull, lax quality.</p>
<p>But when you sit upright in a relaxed and attentive posture, the effect of evoking the meditative mind is clear; and if you keep your hands aligned palms-up, lightly connected in a circle, the effect is also clear.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to be aware of our deeply ingrained mind-habit of checking, analyzing, and filtering all of life through our thinking. We put so much energy into getting things pinned down. We habitually don't want to take a step until something has been explained to us. And we feel we know something when we have a concept about it....</p>
<p>All that is just bullshit! Far from being our knowledge and satisfaction, this habit just distances us from reality. It keeps us at arm's length from the boundless, mysterious movement of the moment. We <em>don't</em> know things by having them explained and clinging to concepts. That's just illusion. This is what we are trying to cut through by meditating; but even in the realm of meditation we habitually keep ourselves at arm's length from plain reality.</p>
<p>So it is much better if I don't explain every last aspect of meditation. It is much better if you trust your teachers and the forms that have been proven, over millennia, to work in bringing forth awakening. It is much better if you believe your body and tell your clinging-clutching-thinking to shut up and get in the back seat. It is much better if you allow an open question to inform you rather than sell out to a cheap idea, opinion, or catchphrase someone else has passed on to you.</p>
<p>When you approach a loved one with an embodied intention of honesty and generosity, how is your body naturally formed? Your hands naturally open and turn upward. Your arms naturally open into an embracing circle.</p>
<p>When you are fully at peace with a landscape, perhaps after a hike into the wilderness, how does that peace and unity express itself? The body is naturally settled and upright. It naturally expresses both relaxation and noble presence, as if it is embodying the breath and beauty of the landscape itself.</p>
<p>These things can be experienced as real and true. It is a simple matter. Only our habitual thinking -- our attached, conceptual way of relating to life -- keeps us cynically detached. We imagine our cynicism to be wise, but all it is is immature. Once we realize that body, mind, and world are truly one thing, everything can be seen as <em>mudra</em> -- configurations of one essential energy.</p>
<p>So the hand positions have a very clear expression and effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in some streams of meditation, namely the yogic streams, physical configuration becomes very important if not essential to the practice. The more subtle 'inner' and 'secret' practices of Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese yoga require the body to be in particular alignment so the subtle energy can flow and be guided in a particular way. With awakening comes a specific flow of energy, and it was discovered that things can be approached from the other side: energy can be led in such a way as to bring about awakening. In these practices, postures and positions are critical.</p>
<p>All meditation involves <em>some</em> yogic aspect. It makes no sense to work on one level or aspect and oppose the work on another level or aspect. Body, speech, mind, intent, and environment are all brought into play, harmonized toward the goal sought in meditation. Therefore, body and hand positions are passed down by wise and kind teachers, in support of your effort.</p>
<p>Beginners commonly operate on the most basic levels; so while the postures will be helpful, they won't be all-important. At this point, one is just trying to understand and digest the approach and learn the method without falling into total distraction. The mind is not finely tuned so as to perceive every effect of the form. Thus many beginners may assume that the form is meaningless. That's not the case! It's that their clumsiness and ignorance are still in the way of their perception!</p>
<p>The common <em>cosmic mudra</em> hand position evokes open-handedness, universal unity, and emptiness. It circulates and balances the two sides of the body and the active and passive dynamics of the energy. It frames the <em>hara</em> or <em>dantien</em>, the central seat of energy, settling the grasping, manipulative tendency of thought-based activity and bringing it down into the body in its most stable place. It both honors and assists in the cultivation of the concentrated essence that in yogic process is converted to qi/energy and further to shen/spirit, which is the presence upon which spiritual activity is based.</p>
<p>But all that is not knowledge. <em>Doing it</em> is knowledge.</p>
