  <h1>Enjoyment of states of ecstacy</h1>

<p>I haven't read the linked thread, but will comment on the principle.</p>
<p>You are right that attachment is a problem. It's not morally bad, it just engenders patterns of suffering for oneself and others.</p>
<p>Enjoyment is no problem, though. If you can also enjoy difficulty and neutrality, enjoyment of ease and pleasure is great, while it lasts. Enjoyment is, in fact, a sort of shortcut to release. I think many practitioners can relate to the infectious quality of joy radiated by many of their teachers, and its liberating quality. It's as if everything is okay: the pain of practice is okay; the drama and struggle of one's life is okay; silence is okay; pleasure is okay. The ease that comes with this allows one to drop many layers of armor that keep one separate from basic mind, and thus more subtle states of meditation may be possible.</p>
<p>"Ecstacy" is an ambiguous term. Are you talking about the breakthrough that moves beyond narrow-mindedness and duality, or are you talking about accompanying feelings? The word ecstacy is used in both those ways. For example, many people understand <em>ecstatic dance</em> to be a sort of very exuberant party — "girls gone wild" in New Age form. They may believe in, and join in tacit group contracts to glorify, an "anything goes" attitude. They may associate with the peak experience of dancing wildly, and pursue the good feeling that comes with it. That is all attachment and delusion, regardless of how many participate in the contract of pursuit.</p>
<p>But the central point of ecstacy, letting go to something greater, is valid and valuable.</p>
<p>The experience of moving beyond the old structure of self involves a release of energy. In this way it is somewhat like the release of energy that happens when molecules change states: the energy held in the old structure is liberated. So although the main point is that one lets go of stagnancy and patterned clinging, there may indeed be powerful feelings and other experiences that go along with the letting-go.</p>
<p>It's a pitfall of ego to then attach to the feelings, glorify them, and essentially make them into the new structure, the new prison of self. It's very common for the story to take precedence over reality, despite our good intentions. It is the mark of a mature practitioner to experience the powerful and the overwhelming without making a big deal about it. It's reminiscent of a mature champion who doesn't show off when he wins the boxing match, or who just goes about his business when he scores a touchdown.</p>
<p>Concentration-style meditation tends to produce many more special-energy experiences like visions and euphoric states than do other styles (although such experiences can also arise in other styles). The pressure of holding a single object in the attention and building up concentrative energy is then released when the meditator unifies with his/her object and the 'held self' dissolves. If the maintenance of a single object of focus is seen as a struggle against forces of distraction, yet more pressure is applied to the practice. People who have addictive tendencies or who otherwise try to escape or suppress certain thoughts or energies place an unnatural pressure on the mind. In this sense, concentration practice may begin as an inherently dysfunctional relationship with the mind because it is not openhanded — it has an agenda. It requires good guidance and understanding of correct relationship to proceed in concentration practice without this undue pressure.</p>
<p>Any pressure applied to the mind produces a resulting upshot. The degree and locus of the pressure shape the resulting experience. One must understand that <em>all</em> states, even the higher absorptions, are temporary and empty. But what we most often see arising as euphoric states, feelings of bliss, pleasurable ease, and special experiences usually belong to lower levels of practice. They are in fact phantoms produced by one's own mental pressure. For many meditators, more vivid experiences result from greater mental pressure — more obsessive pursuit of a result or more desperate avoidance of some part of oneself. Thus the states and visions and feelings, and even sometimes psychic abilities, can easily be a sign not of attainment but of immaturity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, someone who is very comfortable with him/herself, and who has gotten the knack of releasing objects (including results like euphoria) can progress quickly to deep states of concentration and enjoy their authentic fruits. If they <em>were</em> attached to the results of a particular level they wouldn't be able to progress to the next higher level; it's that simple.</p>
<p>How do we know what someone's real attainment is — whether they are producing their own illusory material because of their dysfunctional relationship with their own mind, or whether they are experiencing the authentic fruit of concentration? There are cues in the way a practitioner speaks of her/his experience. Do they glorify certain states? Is there a sense of self-aggrandizement? Is the focus on the experience, as if showing vacation photos, or is the focus on compassion and helping others wake up and be free of suffering?</p>
<p>When you yourself have done the work and have attained those states, you will be able to distinguish someone who's got it from someone who's weaving a tale. But how much do we have to check someone else's practice anyway? Our responsibility lies in our own correct relationship. Our responsibility is moment to moment correct relationship with our mind; and never mind all the wonderful or bullshit stories out there.</p>
