  <h1>Meditating on motivational phrases/quotes..?</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>As much as I appreciate meditation and Buddhist-related philosophy as being a fantastic part of life….</em></p>
<p>That's got the direction backwards. The success and the creative, interesting work is a fantastic <em>part</em> of life. Buddhism or not, the complete way is all of life. Your correct human direction includes everything you do; so compartmentalizing your activity into this nice thing here and that nice thing there is a shallow and limited approach.</p>
<p>Complete life, in fact, will <em>not</em> be only success and interest. It will sometimes be failure and struggle. At that time, how can you be free, how can you be complete? You can't get freedom or completion from anything outside.</p>
<p>No future event or object or relationship will get it for you. That is because your complete being is not outside of you — it is already here. But if you want it, you have to awaken to it in your whole life, not stuff it into a corner. You are the only one who decides whether your life is limited or limitless, whether you continue grasping or whether you are satisfied.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>…if I am too happy with 'the present', I will end up unemployed living at my parents house…!</em></p>
<p>This is a very common misunderstanding of the idea of presence. In fact, presence is not an idea or concept. True presence is <em>free</em> of concepts, so it is free of the mind's limitation. That means it can be vibrantly active when action is necessary, and completely at rest when action is not necessary.</p>
<p>"Satisfaction" doesn't mean resting on your laurels. "Completion" doesn't mean you've reached the end of life. The satisfaction and completion of an awakened being mean the burdens and stagnant patterns that common people carry around have been broken through. It is an incredibly energetic situation, like harnessing atomic energy, only more far-reaching.</p>
<p>If you ever meet an awakened person, or even a relatively clear person, you will immediately experience their vivid energy. For example, the great Zen Master Seung Sahn would always teach "Put it all down!" but he was the most dynamic, energetic, influential person I've ever met.</p>
<p>So many teachers and masters that I've met have this in common. Their success comes from a different source. Trying to push things along with your personal effort eventually drains you; and then you collapse, perhaps blame yourself, struggle for a time until you build up energy again, and then you might give it another go. This up and down cycle can happen repeatedly through life... and then you die. But if you attain your complete self, your energy and the world's energy come together. You no longer push because your mind is no longer in opposition to anything. Great things can be accomplished because they flow through you, not because you hang on to an idea and try to force it on the world.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>Is getting myself motivated to get off my ass and work towards a career I enjoy purely a pursuit of the ego..?</em></p>
<p>No, it doesn't have to be, absolutely not. But it also can be, and most often is, as we can see all around us. It is completely up to you to clarify your direction and attain your complete self.</p>
<p>A raindrop evaporates soon after the sun comes out on a hot day; an ocean persists for eons. Some insects live their whole lives in a day; the life of galaxies is beyond our ability to comprehend, measured in millions and billions of years. Which among these is more or less successful?</p>
<p>If you want great, deep, long-lasting success, you must hold strongly to a great, deep, and long-lasting direction. On the other hand, if your direction is shallow and based on the waverings of pleasure and pain, loss and gain, then your success will likewise evaporate quickly and waft around with the winds of the world.</p>
<p>Your true motivation is already within you. You already have life, and you already have something moving uniquely in you — a movement no one else could duplicate. If you connect well to yourself, that movement will find its own way. But trying to drum something up already assumes an opposition; it has failure built in.</p>
<p>So I ask you: what <em>does</em> motivate you? What interests you? Where do you respond automatically? What do you find yourself moved to stand up for and make an effort for?</p>
<p>Many people have a strong gut sense of justice: when they see a person or animal being abused, their energy immediately rises, and they feel a profound agitation. This is one of the things that moves through us naturally. <em>Following up</em> on that impulse is the difference between embodied people and people who are shut down. Many things already move through you. How can you trust your movement? That is what you practice in meditation. It is inherently success-oriented in that it allows the truth to move in its own way, without adding concepts and opinions that cover it up.</p>
