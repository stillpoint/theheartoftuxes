  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>These a wonderful questions!</p>
<p>There is a resolution to all of these, which is to discover who (or what) you really are. The many great enlightened masters alive now and throughout history have all attained this point.</p>
<p>But this point can't be attained by thinking alone. Gathering data, making logical connections, building a case, receiving expert opinions, and even listening to the speech of enlightened beings cannot make you realize your own mind. You have to find it yourself. It's not that there is no training for it or that good instruction is not important; but essentially there is nothing that can be added to it from the outside, and concepts can't touch it.</p>
<p>So to actually answer your questions in a way that satisfies, you have to seek and find your mind.</p>
<p>1) A person is not complete; but you are not a person. 'Person' is a limited concept â€” useful and sometimes necessary in order to act and relate with others in life, but with no reality beyond the concept. It's an idea, but not what you really are.</p>
<p>This highlights the difference between useful, practical concepts that we use in everyday life, and the basic truth that is beyond all concepts. When you hear a teaching, you should know whether the teaching is conveying relative concepts or whether it's talking about truth beyond concept.</p>
<p>So if you attach to the idea that you are a small, separate person within a universe of separate beings and objects, you live under the illusion of incompletion. It is like having a complicated dream of dramatic events and various friends and enemies: in the dream you are separate; but when you wake up you realize that all of the people and events came from your mind. In the dream, you and all the others were separate and incomplete; but when you wake up, you realize the one source of all the dream beings and events.</p>
<p>2) That kind of hole or void is talking about psychological emptiness. This comes from the mistake people make about who they really are. Thinking of themselves as separate, incomplete 'people', they experience the drama of gain and loss within their dream situation. Within the dream, people can become relatively more or less happy; but complete, perfect, unchanging happiness only comes from waking up from the dream. Only when that illusion of incompletion is seen through can you claim the happiness that is beyond ups and downs.</p>
<p>3) You are already complete. Before you were born, you were complete. Before your ancestors were born, you were complete. This is true of everyone. But most people don't <em>realize</em> that. Some may <em>think</em> it. Some may get good teaching and learn, and even come to believe deeply, that they are originally complete. But until they see directly their own nature, this is all still speculation. So the kind of 'knowing' that comes from thinking is insufficient. You have to see directly what is the case.</p>
<p>A chemist may know in great detail what a strawberry is made of. A botanist may know with exceptional expertise how a strawberry grows and what all its parts do. But even if someone has all this knowledge, until they see and feel and taste a strawberry, they can't be said to really know what it is. So knowing your own true nature is like actually seeing and holding and eating a strawberry. It needs to be direct experience. This is the kind of knowledge that is necessary; no one else can give it to you.</p>
<p>4) The aspect of you that is born, is not complete. But your unborn nature is complete. Since you are attached to the idea that you are your body, that you were born, and that your feelings belong to this 'self', therefore you are incomplete. You are incomplete in that you believe in what is incomplete. But when you see what you really are, you see that this was never born, never dies, is not affected by loss and gain, and is not separate from anything in the universe.</p>
<p>'Complete' is synonymous with 'happiness', but not the kind of happiness people usually mean. It is not just nice feeling. It is an unshakeable peace, not depending on any feeling or thought or situation. Anything can come, anything can remain, anything can go, and this happiness is not altered in the slightest.</p>
<p>5) If you believe that you are only part of everything, then yes you are imperfect and incomplete. If you see what you really are, you can understand your perfect and complete nature.</p>
<p>Again, this is <em>not</em> philosophy! This is an extremely important point. If you treat it as philosophy, you will utterly miss the point. You have to have a direct experience of your true nature. Having a proper teacher is necessary. You can start the process yourself, looking into the questions you have asked, and trying to find your own mind; but soon you should find a capable teacher, someone who has awakened from the dream of life, and who has learned how to convey that wisdom to others.</p>
