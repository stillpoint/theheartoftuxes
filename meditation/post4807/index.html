  <h1>Focusing on the spot between the eyebrows</h1>

<p>I have no doubt that many good encounters have been had with your method and similar ones. I'm passing on a warning based on my experience and second-hand accounts. Rather than denigrating your practice I'm honoring it as worthy of care.</p>
<p>In response to your question:</p>
<p>Qigong and Taoist Internal Energy Arts often teach that young people and especially young men should not initially focus on centers above the heart because it brings too much volatile energy upward and unbalances the person. In performing standing meditation, for instance, young men and hot-headed people are often guided to keep their arms lower and focus lower in the body to help settle the energy.</p>
<p>[My encounters with these teachings have been numerous, both in person and in print, but I don't have many citations for you right now. I've included one quote further down in this post.]</p>
<p>Zen traditions and most overtly the Korean Zen tradition instruct on the difference between energy "up in the head", which relates to overthinking, energy around the heart, which relates to over-feeling, and energy down in the belly, which helps one to be centered.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Energy: When we let our energy drop to the Dan Tien our mind becomes quiet and our center becomes stronger.</em>

<p>Gopi Krishna is one of the more famous examples of energy practice gone wrong. He regarded his kundalini experience as a fast evolution, a transformative upheaval, but it went through some agonizingly painful and life-threatening territory. Krishna wrote his autobiographical account so that others could avoid his mistake — as an informative warning, not as a condemnation of energy meditation
or kundalini awakening.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Though Krishna's development is often held with the highest of praise, he instead felt only depression and anxiety. And it was the beginning of a nearly 25 year struggle to regain his mental, physical and psychic facilities.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>Before telling of his struggle with the aftermath of his Kundalini awakening, Krishna gives us a description of Prana and the Nadi (yoga) indicating that Kundalini results in an increase of prana, or the Subtle Energy which controls and regulates all bodily functions. The danger of turning up the voltage soon became apparent to Krishna a few days after his awakening. He portrays his sensations with painful images like "a jet of molten copper...dashed against my crown". He was sick and tired and felt awful. About two months after awakening Kundalini, Krishna believed he was about to die. He had been in agonizing pain for hours, and had barely eaten or slept since his first experience. In his last throws of pain he had a thought; perhaps Kundalini had risen up the pingala instead of the central nadi sushumna. Focusing all his attention he forced Kundalini through the sushumna, saving his life. Krishna felt the burning pain cease, and burning flame in his skull was replaced by blissful radiance.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini:_The_Evolutionary_Energy_in_Man#Physio-Kundalini_syndrome">Wikipedia article</a> on his autobiography</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are these sundry comments from teachers and practitioners from various online sites:</p>
<p>&gt;<em>As I practiced it sounds really crazy But I think that these exercises created some sort of energy that attract astral forms. One night I woke up and saw this thick rope strung from my window sill to the door. at the moment i knew what it was. I made the mistake of touching this animal or thing and felt a jolt like electricity. I was definitely awake I immediately felt very sick and had chills all over my body.</em></p>
<p>&gt;…</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If this is not some crazy hallucination then whatever I have been doing is either lighting me up like a porch light to attract moths or these entities are coming through to this world via my consciousness. A hallucination cannot affect you physiologically to make a shock effect. I also have noticed that when did the exercises something seems to materialize in my room. The way this thing or object would materialize is that it would appear like it was a different refractive index like the air. I would also see entities that looked like this right after I wake up. I have even noticed small feathers falling down in my room.</em></p>
<p>&gt;<em>The level of perception was incredible. But was not worth being bothered by these entities.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>from the forum post<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread679265/pg6&amp;mem="> I Opened My Third Eye And I Regret It</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>&gt;<em>… I do know when a person pushes the third eye too fast you will often see people become delusional. I also know people who force or try to do third eye too fast will complain about headaches and such. Confusion seems to be also a common symptom.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Taoist teacher Casey Kochmer on <a href="http://personaltao.com/taoism-library/shamanic-teachings/about-visions/what-is-the-third-eye/third-eye-faq/#Third_Eye_Dangerous">Personaltao.com</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>&gt;*…soon after starting to meditate and clear my mind I had experience of being sucked into a void of nothingness, for what felt like an eternity. When I woke up I felt the most intense love and feeling of beautiful interconnectedness with the entire universe!!! This feeling lasted for a few days and it was so incredible. What followed was very scary. I started to have intense nightmares and would wake up at 3am every night with the feeling of some sort of presence near by. I had intense mood swings and physical health symptoms which I believe was my body spontaneously cleansing itself. Friends and family started sending me messages of love and gratitude and commented on the fact that I had a beautiful glow. Since then, when I meditate or excersise I get an intense headache in my third eye region to the point that I feel like it is cracking open. Painful.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>&gt;<em>Because of the higher consciousness, the person will likely see the falseness of others egos, society’s norms and values and indeed the fakeness of themselves. Their own ego is exposed as a fraud very suddenly by their experience of higher consciousness. Seeing yourself as a fraud is not easy but while the higher forces are incarnating it feels great and it can be seen clearly. Unfortunately the very same ego that has been seen as a fraud is the one that is creating the delusions. Also if the person’s Third Eye is activated sufficiently there will be hallucinations. Even though the Third Eye is seeing into other realities and the hallucinations are based on this actual vision, they will often be distorted by the ego. With the activated Third Eye and chaotic chitta the imagination of the psychotic can be so vivid that it seems real. Indeed some of what the psychotic may see is actual hallucination.</em></p>

<p><strong>TL; DR: There's no denying that different people have different results in different situations. We all tend to recommend what we think has worked for us. There are many different paths that provide benefit for the many types of character and constitution possessed by humans. But let's take some care and responsibility in urging or recommending activities that could have serious repercussions for those taking our advice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's all too easy for us to throw words to the wind in this anonymous forum. We can easily scurry on, while the listener is left to deal with the results of any recommendations they adopt.</strong></p>
