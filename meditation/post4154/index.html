  <h1>This just happened to me during Meditation. is this normal?</h1>

<p>There are various possible causes, but the main point is that none of these experiences means anything very significant. You should feel free to calmly and resolutely return to your method of meditation whenever anything like this arises.</p>
<p>The attitude we hold when meditating is that everything is no problem. Anything that arises can arise, anything that remains can remain, and anything that passes away can pass away. We don't care about all that, because all that is not what we're getting at. We are only concerned with our presence, our center within it all. So maintain the attitude that nothing can sway you from your presence, and any time something comes up that takes you away, the moment you notice that you've been taken away simply and immediately return to your method of meditation. Simple and immediate return is your great power; nothing that comes and goes can match it.</p>
<p>So even if a demon appears or even if Buddha or Jesus appears, never mind. Only return to the method of meditation.</p>
<p>At the beginning stages of meditation, there can be many unusual experiences. They are unusual for you, but they are not uncommon for meditators. Every meditator I've know (and I've known many) has experienced many things like this. Sometimes colors or visions, sometimes sensations, sometimes energy, sometimes emotions.... It doesn't matter; it's beside the point. Don't get distracted.</p>
<p>If you allow yourself to get distracted, then the part of your mind that plots to keep the status quo, to <em>not</em> surrender, to <em>not</em> open, will then know what it can do to distract you from your purpose in meditation. Any time you get close to release it will bring up the distraction, until you persevere and break through. It is better if you just persevere from the start, without going through drama about it.</p>
<p>The common man's mind is like a sea heaving in a storm. It thrashes about everywhere chaotically. In fact, the nature of the thinking mind is like this naturally. Its creative, connection-making capacity is always bringing up something new, generating new excitement, jumping here and there. Most of us have very little awareness of the movements of the mind; and so when we finally, after years of ignoring, sit down and focus we can be quite surprised at the things that are revealed! When we start to see our mind's activity, it can seem strange indeed. But rather than try to destroy or hide from this marvelous, miraculous ability, we seek to find our calm center that doesn't <em>attach</em> to it.</p>
<p>So one possible explanation for your experience is that it is a normal function of mind that is only now being brought to the light of awareness. But it is also quite possible, and in fact likely, that some pressure is being applied to the body-mind that is causing it to erupt in unusual ways. It is rare for a beginning meditator to approach practice with a balanced, openhanded attitude. By the time one gets to the meditation mat, the energy and enthusiasm of starting out on this magnificent path has usually become a pressure to achieve something. A grasping or forcing attitude bleeds into the practice, so if you're counting breaths for example, rather than simply doing your best and easily returning every time the mind wanders, there can be a self-blame or mounting pressure to dispel the distracting thoughts — the effort turns toward controlling the thinking rather than letting it be. This often goes hand-in-hand with controlling the body, and especially the breath. It usually takes some extended time and effort (say, months or maybe years of consistent practice) before one finds a natural relationship with the posture and breath and flow of thoughts.</p>
<p>When one pressures oneself into certain states of clarity by trying to control the posture or breath or thinking, that pressure has to go somewhere. Energy is never lost; it just finds the path of least resistance. So the energy often arises at the point of your focus, in manifestations of imagination or sensation or physiology. If you can learn to settle and be more calm and openhanded about your practice, letting the thinking and breathing flow naturally and letting the posture find its settled balance, then colors in your vision and other manifestations will likely come less often or less intensely. But in any case, they're nothing of note and you should keep returning to your method of meditation.</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, variations in breathing patterns and other configurations of the bodymind can lead to sort of hallucinatory experiences, which are not significant other than being a sign that more flow is necessary in your body, breathing, and attitude.</p>
<p>You should be meditating with open eyes. The eyes shouldn't be tense and glaring, but they should be open. You have enough to deal with in the seductive quality of the thinking, imagining mind without giving it the upper hand; but that is just what happens when you close your eyes — you give the strange movement of the thinking, imagining mind the upper hand. Keeping your eyes open offers you the opportunity to return to the reality before you.</p>
<p>It is said that the floor or wall is one of your teachers. When the floor or wall is clear, then your practice is clear. When the floor or wall disappears because you've gone off in your thinking, then you know that it's time to return. If you close your eyes, you give up that teacher (and the opportunity to be enlightened through vision), and allow the inner dream world to have a stronger voice. This is not necessary, and not recommended.</p>
<p>Finally, strange experiences will happen throughout your meditation career. It is best if you keep a correct relationship to them from the very beginning: they are not significant, they are not the practice; only return. Only return. Keep that attitude, and you will develop a mind that can't be moved by any outside or inside experience — you will gain a still, clear mirror reflecting reality moment to moment.</p>
<p>At deeper levels of meditation, great energy and strange experiences can be released. You will be unlocking patterns of suppression at the deepest levels of your being. Depending on the degree of pressure that was applied in maintaining those patterns and the degree of pressure that is applied within the practice, the released energies may flow easily or explode forcefully. All of this is natural, by dint of cause and effect. Keep your eye on the prize and don't be distracted. (The "prize" being your true life this moment.)</p>
