  <h1>Few thought about Sri Ramana Maharishis Self Inquiry [ /w TL;DR ]</h1>

<p>I'll be happy to respond to your questions and comments. I've trained extensively in koan practice (face-to-face in the interview room, with several zen masters), and I've also done residential training with Ramana Maharshi's self-inquiry method at one of his school's ashrams.</p>
<p>You write a couple of times that you think there is no self to be found and that there is "nothing" to be found. You also say that you don't consider yourself a seeker, you believe there is no answer to the question of self-inquiry, you are skeptical about practices that promise happiness, you are perfectly fine with good and bad in your life, and that you are generally content in your life. This actually all reflects a false self-image that perhaps you are not aware of.</p>
<p>All of what you say revolves around a "you" and what you think of that "you". You accept or reject teachings based on what you are comfortable with, and you assess their wisdom based on the limited range of your own — if you don't see it as useful, you assume it is not.</p>
<p>This attachment to a self-image is confirmed by the thoughts that appear in your awareness when you try to do the practice: whether the sense of self is solid or vague, your thinking patterns come back to assessing your own situation and condition.</p>
<p>That's okay; everyone has that; you just have it with a bit of unawareness of having it. <em>Behind</em> that thinking there is something clear and pure. That clear and pure thing is not moved by the appearance of good and bad. In fact, that clear and pure thing is not moved by any form that appears. It reflects perfectly, like a flawless mirror that is not harmed or marked by the images that flow in it.</p>
<p>When you let go of the forms, the images, you can return to your true nature as the mirror. This is considered true happiness, when you are deeply seated in your true self rather than identified with the incomplete, changeable, and unsatisfying forms of the world (which includes the incomplete, changeable, and unsatisfying form of your self-image). It is not sparkly, as it does not promise only good and pleasant forms; it promises stability <em>beyond</em> good and bad, pleasant and unpleasant.</p>
<p>In your current mind-set, you entrench yourself in the world of forms and refuse to venture beyond. You hope to find your comfort there, and in fact you say that you are completely content. But something brought you here to comment and question, something moves you to look into practice, and your very words express doubt and conflict. So you are not content. It's just that you have not opened your eyes fully to the futility of seeking comfort in things that essentially can't provide it.</p>
<p>You haven't yet fully grasped that, in the words of the Buddha, <em>nothing whatsoever is worthy of attachment</em>. You may think that by arranging things well and keeping the <em>right</em> attachments you can live a life that is quite good enough.</p>
<p>If you want to understand what is beyond thought, you have to go beyond thought. You have to put down all your concepts, all your strategies, all your agendas. It doesn't mean you have to live without concepts, strategies, or agendas; but you have to be willing to put them down <em>for a moment</em>. This includes the deep-seated concepts of "me" and "my life". These have to be let go of if you are to understand what koan practice or self-inquiry practice are pointing to. It is an act of great courage and great faithfulness to take that step of putting it all down in a moment.</p>
<p>And this is the correct function of both koan practice and self-inquiry. It is <em>not</em> that you are supposed to find an answer in your thinking-understanding. That is not the aim. The questioning itself is the wonderful, live, aware faculty in which you are to participate. You become an open question, a space in which truth appears by itself.</p>
<p>Don't think of these practices in terms of your limited understanding. Step into them and actualize them as your great Unknowing wisdom, which is beyond understanding. If you want to touch what is beyond understanding, you can't get there by using your old ego-based methods.</p>
<p>With the self-inquiry method, you sincerely seek out the self at the center of your life — the one for whom all this experience is present. You seek out the self; you don't speculate or try to define the self. Is this clear? Try to find it; don't think about it.</p>
<p>Next, you should neither hold an idea that there is a self to find nor that there isn't. You don't know! It is wrong, immature, and arrogant to assume that there is nothing to be found just because you haven't found it through the small efforts that you've made so far. You don't know what is there; but you <em>do</em> know that so far you experience a <em>sense</em> of self, something that hears the hearing, sees the seeing, thinks the thinking, and does the doing. So in self-inquiry practice, you look for that and try to find it.</p>
<p>Ramana Maharshi spoke of the I-thought. So if you feel rankled at the prospect of looking for something that you figure is not there, consider that you are seeking the <em>sense</em> of "I" or the thought of it, not trying to find and grasp some non-existant thing. Sri Ramana Maharshi wasn't a fool!</p>
<p>It is not a speculative exercise. It is not about coming up with any kind of model or concept or summation for what "I" is. You just try to find it.</p>
<p>Upon sincerely trying to find the self, you will soon come to a point where there is utter ungraspability. Only "don't know", as Zen Master Seung Sahn was fond of saying. The self-image (often termed "ego") and its habit hate ungraspability; so there will be a great tendency to think of this place as incomplete or wrong practice. Reject that. Reject the tendency to try to get some result, something to hold on to. Rather, rest in the unknowing, ungrasping place. This is the practice.</p>
<p>That unknowing, ungrasping place — that open question — is clear and pure and all-inclusive. All knowledges are there.</p>
<p>Never mind checking how you're doing, how the self feels (more or less solid), what you've gained or lost, how far you've progressed, how this compares to what you've read or heard, or any of those speculative, checking thoughts. Only try to find the self, and when you reach the place where you can't move in any direction just rest there openhandedly. In that space, the practice does its own work; the meditator is not qualified to check or steer it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
