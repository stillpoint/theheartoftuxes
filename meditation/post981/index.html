  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Is your method clear</strong> â€” do you know what you're supposed to be doing, and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do shorter sessions</strong>. Enjoy for 5 minutes, once or twice a day. If you don't want to do it, don't force yourself at this point. Later when the benefits are clear to you, and you have more grounding in the method, then you can do "sit no matter what"; but at this point it only discourages you. You need to build up good associations with meditation, so enjoy for 5 minutes or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't check the timer</strong>. Only do it. For five minutes, give yourself over to the method completely. This is why I ask whether you are clear on the method; so you can be free of doubt, and just surrender. It is because you don't surrender yourself that you have upset; you resist, you control, you hold back, and that is upsetting. Relax and enjoy being yourself without trying to do anything for five minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>See a doctor</strong>, therapist, and/or sleep therapist about the nightmares. And remember: Garbage In, Garbage Out. Whatever you do with your mind during the day will come out eventually in your waking or sleeping experience. If you make anxious thoughts, or watch or participate in violent activities or other disturbing things, this will appear in your mind later (sometimes soon after, sometimes long after when something triggers it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gratitude is good practice</strong>. It's okay to force gratitude. Try to be sincere. Even if you don't feel it immediately, you are planting good seeds in your mind. Positive In, Positive Out. If you plant seeds of gratitude, kindness, and peace, they will grow and appear in your life, sooner or later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use one experience or relationship as a starting point. It doesn't have to be new every time. For example, I often think of the cat that lived with me years ago. She's long since passed away, but I still love her, and I'm still grateful for her, and thinking of her still opens a soft spot in my heart. Once that soft spot is open, it's easier to offer warmth and gratitude to other things. Likewise, you can use something that is close to your heart to bring you to your softness and warmth. Usually it should be something that has given you support or love or kindness without asking anything in return. A teacher... a kind relative who was there for you at a difficult time... an sweet encounter with an animal... even a possession that has always been there for you. Avoid things that generate strong attachment or that bring bad feelings along with the good (so romantic connections may work, but are sometimes not the best). Once you find something that is easy to be grateful for, you can practice with that and extend to one or two other things when it feels right.</p>
<p>Hands, eyes, ears... breath, food... an old baseball cap that's been on adventures with you, shoes that have protected your feet and helped you travel and do things... a stranger on Reddit.... Light... Empty space... The ability to think rationally, the ability to offer kindness...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guard the gateways.</strong> Help yourself by paying attention to what goes in and out. What do you take in with your eyes, ears, and thinking? What food goes in your mouth, and what speech comes out of your mouth? What do you make with your thinking? If you take in negative things, and if you create negative thoughts and words, then you will have negativity in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to avoid negativity because of the other people you are with. In that case, you still have some control. You can limit your engagement to simple, friendly communication and then quietly leave; and you can limit the way your mind increases the negativity. Don't repeat or magnify it in your thought and speech. For example, at the end of your post you say something unnecessarily negative about yourself. There's no need to do that. Guard what comes in and out of your gates, and you will gain more control over your life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do one thing that will bring you a little bit of joy or peace.</strong> Some possibilities, take them or leave them: Have a drink of water. Or a warm drink. Give yourself the gift of something healthy. Step outside and enjoy the sky. Take a full breath for a couple of seconds. Go for a bike ride. Read something that contributes to peace or joy. Do a nice thing for someone, without them having to ask. Take care of a pet and share enjoyment. Take care of a plant and share enjoyment. Relax <em>completely</em> and consciously for a few seconds or minutes. Do a couple of minutes of something you are good at or like to do. Clean one corner of your living space. Put your bare feet or hands on the earth. Clean your body. ...There are countless things you can do to bring a bit of light to the moment. Your life is in the moment, and you can always bring a bit of peace, joy, light to this moment. You train the ability to bring your enjoyment to the moment; you get better at it with practice; and it becomes part of your skill set.</li>
