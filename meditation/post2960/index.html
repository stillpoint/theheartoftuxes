  <h1>Newbie here with a few questions...</h1>

<p>That's very wonderful that you're trying meditation with such sincerity. Your questions are also very, very good. Even thought you're just starting off, you have a good sense of the questions to ask.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>What is the goal?</em></p>
<p>First and foremost is this question, <em>why</em>. If the goal, the <em>why</em>, is clear, then even if you make a mistake or wander off the path soon you can return. If the direction of practice is not clear, then even if you happen to do correct practice it will be easy to eventually lose your way.</p>
<p>It is like traveling in the wilderness. If you know the correct direction and have a compass, you can find your way. Even if sometimes you turn the wrong way, soon you can correct yourself. But if you don't know the correct direction or if you don't have a compass, even if you accidentally travel in the right direction it will be possible to get completely turned around with little chance of finding your way.</p>
<p>The correct direction is 'for all'. The correct compass is putting it all down.</p>
<p>In the Tibetan <em>Ngondro</em> (foundational) teachings the many great accomplished enlightened masters who passed down the teaching describe three levels of positive motivation:</p>
<p>The lowest, but still positive and worthy, level of motivation is to help your life. At this level, you use meditation and other spiritual practices to improve your situation temporarily. You can reduce stress, you can develop concentration, you can improve your character. These things help you be happier and be a better person in the world. But this motivation is limited and temporary; it's positive as it stands, but if the motivation doesn't eventually broaden and deepen the gains will be temporary, and your deep-set habitual patterns and ignorance-based activity (your karma) will overcome the practice and you will fall back into suffering.</p>
<p>The middling level of motivation is to finish the job: to attain complete, unexcelled enlightenment. This means you aim not only to cut through ignorance and perceive the true nature of your self, but to perceive the true nature of all of life and to eliminate all traces of ignorance and its tendencies. Awakened masters experience various levels of awakening, various depths of insight. This middle motivation is to not stop at the various levels, but to always continue until the very last trace is completely purified, and your life is a complete and stainless and endless expression of enlightenment.</p>
<p>The highest level of motivation doesn't even occur to many people. Even many practitioners don't consider what could be higher than attaining the highest enlightenment. The highest level of motivation is to achieve the greatest unexcelled enlightenment <em>for all beings, everywhere</em>. You commit to relieving the suffering of all people, animals, insects, spirits, and other beings in all realms, beings of good character or bad character, brilliant and dull beings, advanced and primitive beings, and achieving their complete enlightenment without leaving a single one behind.</p>
<p>This highest motivation is the correct goal of meditation. This is the direction: unreserved, unlimited compassion for all. (And you are included! Never leave yourself out!)</p>
<p>The way you always connect to that direction is by putting it all down. Completely and unreservedly let go of any grasping, wanting, holding, making, checking, judging, and avoiding. This is your compass. It is what you practice in meditation each time you ungrasp the distracting thoughts and return to the method. It is what you practice when you first sit down and relax. It is what you practice when act openhandedly and spontaneously in everyday life. A good teacher and course of training will train you in making your putting-it-all-down compass strong and accurate.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>If I'm not wandering, then I'm assuming the only option left is being in the now.</em></p>
<p>You could say that. It's not a bad way of saying it. 'Now'. Or 'reality'. Or 'this'.</p>
<p>Just know that saying it is not the same as doing it. The word is not the thing itself. The <em>real</em> 'now' is an ineffable, living reality. It is beyond concept; and it is also very plain and very, very simple. You already understand before the need for words and concepts. Hot is hot, cold is cold. A river flows, sugar tastes sweet. These 'now' things are beyond concept, but very, very simple. More simple than words.</p>
<p>When you put it all down, opening your hands (so to speak) completely, the whole universe is included in your practice. Past, present, and future are all expressed. All dimensions are embraced. The everyday realm and the pure realm are included. This comes not from your doing, but because it is already the nature of things. By letting all things be, you include Nirvana and Samsara in your practice. It is still very plain and simple, but it includes everything.</p>
<p>It is like the complete sphere of life itself, which includes everything but is very plain and simple. When you gaze at the night sky, these two aspects are apparent: inconceivable and plain-and-simple. Your open-handedness does it, or rather allows it to be done. The name for this is <em>Upekkha</em>, or boundless equanimity. It is even-mindedness that has no limit. You can practice Upekkha momentarily, a thousand time in a meditation sitting; and you can strengthen your practice of it so that it becomes a primary, continuous way of relating to life.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Am I doing this right?</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven't read <em>10% Happier</em>, so I don't know what practice it teaches. Try to be faithful to the practice you're learning. (And it sounds as if you are.)</p>
<p>From your description, your meditation certainly seems to be correct.</p>
<p>In particular, I don't know what <em>exact</em> object of focus you work with: whether the instruction recommends 'breath', 'sensation of breath' at a certain point, or 'awareness of breath', any of which are possible and valid. They would point to subtly different ways of working.</p>
<p>Not knowing more about the method, I'd venture that if visualizing your lungs helps you connect to the object it is not a problem, but perhaps there will come a time when you let go of that as something extraneous, having become more clear and rooted in the singular object of meditation itself.</p>
<p>The timing, your use of a timer, and your response to distraction are all very good. Well done.</p>
<p>If the instruction specifies closing your eyes, continue following the method. If it doesn't specify, then keep your eyes open. This has many effects and benefits, not the least of which is that it expresses the correct motivation: meditation not 'for myself', not sinking into a secluded experience, but in engagement with and for the world. Open eyes also help tremendously with proper sharpness and awakeness, and train you in bringing your meditation forth into your daily life.</p>
<p>But there are also reasons for keeping eyes closed; and if this is a traditional method taught by a responsible and accomplished teacher it is best not to second-guess the instruction, but to offer yourself to it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Am I sidetracking myself by doing this?</em></p>
<p>Yes. Stories of what others experience in meditation are mostly meant to relieve your doubt <em>if</em> you happen to experience something like that yourself. Many, many regular and strange things will appear. For the most part, none of them have any special significance.</p>
<p>If you keep Upekkha — openhandedness — you will not put pressure on your mind, and thus your mind will not squeeze out as many strange experiences. But just from the refinement and circulation of energy, the balancing of hormones, the calming of the nervous system, and other gradual effects of meditation, certain experiences may come up. Just let them be, and return to your method.</p>
<p>If your method is a proven vehicle of liberation, and if you let nothing distract you from your method, then it is guaranteed that you will attain the fruit of the method: liberation. It is cause and effect. But if you mess around with it or apply it in a lax manner, those different causes will bring up different effects.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>How will I know when to try and go longer?</em></p>
<p>In general, it is much better for the beginner to establish a practice habit in comfort and eagerness rather than push, hit a wall, and then become despondent. Five minutes of correct practice is incredibly powerful. If anything, I would suggest that you continue for three or four weeks, keeping your schedule very consistent, and adding <em>optional</em> additional 5 minute sittings either as a second session after regular morning and/or evening sittings, or sprinkled now and then through the day.</p>
<p>Some beginners have an unusual capacity and an unusual aspiration. These beginners may seek out a full-on practice setting, like living in a temple for a while or doing supervised retreats. Paired with their capacity and aspiration, the guidance and supportive structure of schedule and group practice make an ideal situation for fast progress. In these cases, it is possible to dive right into longer sittings. The support is there if discomfort or dejection arise. But when you're on your own, it's important to carefully build a strong foundation before pushing yourself hard, because you don't have the same recourse to instruction, encouragement, and environmental support as people living in a practice setting.</p>
<p>Consistency and a good, positive, aspirational relationship to practice are important. These are the places where many people fall off the path before they even travel a significant distance along it.</p>
<p>After three or four weeks, it may be time not only to lengthen your sitting (say, to 10 minutes for another three or four weeks), but to start considering connection with a teacher and practice group. At the approach of each next three or four week phase, consider a small, moderate challenge within the practice (in terms of duration, perhaps) as well as within your life (by trying a new experience and stretching your comfort zone).</p>
<p>Good luck along the path.</p>
