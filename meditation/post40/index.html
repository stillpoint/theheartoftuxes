  <h1>Meditating or snoozing</h1>

<p>Yes, it's very possible. In fact, sleeping is a much stronger habit than meditation is for most of us.</p>
<p>I've written quite a bit on this topic; feel free to search my profile for the terms 'sleeping', 'dreaminess', 'lying down', and 'closed eyes'.</p>
<p>First we need to have a look at your aim and motivation, your method, and your form (posture, how you keep your eyes, how you breathe, etc.).</p>
<p>Clear motivation and clear method go a long way toward wakefulness. They are very supportive of practice, because when you are clear in this regard you can know better when you have drifted off. If you are not clear in your motivation and method, it's much harder to perceive what's a good state of mind and what's not; you may be drifting, but since the feeling can be nice, you may assume you're doing well when it's quite the opposite.</p>
<p>The form and environment are also very influential. Unless the type of meditation requires it, you'll do much better with open eyes. It signifies a willingness to awaken to reality rather than avoid it; and it brightens your awareness. One point of form that is not often taught in beginner's courses is that you can lift your gaze to straight in front of you (say, at a blank wall) rather than down at an angle to the floor. This helps with wakefulness, whereas the downward gaze helps promote calmness.</p>
<p>Sitting up comfortably but alertly is also helpful. Slouching or reclining or lying down all contribute not only to drifting but also to a lazy attitude. (Exceptions include relaxation/surrender-based practices like Å›avasana and visualizations in the sphere of death meditation.) Of course, if you are injured and can't sit up without support it is probably more important to arrange your body and seat so that you won't be distracted by pain or injure yourself further.</p>
<p>The meditator is often not in a good position to distinguish between sleepiness and clarity. This is especially true when the meditator is not yet deeply established in continuous presence. A thousand thoughts and dreams can stream by in the blink of an eye. In the gaps between occasional clarity one may very well be full or drifting or dreaming; and because at those moments the awareness is not strong, one may not perceive in the slightest the state of one's mind.</p>
<p>I've seen many, many people fool themselves about their meditation, thinking of themselves as clear because they often enter thoughtless states; but the thoughtless states are not <em>awake</em>; they are dull. It is indulgence in a sort of waking sleep, and it leads to further indulgence, and often egotism and defensiveness when the comfortable sleep is called into question or challenged.</p>
<p>Whatever object of meditation you're working with should not only be consistently -- and eventually, continuously -- present; it should also be <em>vivid</em> in your awareness. Vivid, clear, bright. Having a clear motivation helps with this, because if you're vague or don't really know or care much about <em>why</em> you're meditating, your mental and energetic resources will be diffuse and wavering rather than focused.</p>
<p>This also points out the importance of a teacher and a set course of training. The teacher is of great value in this respect because she/he can usually see your mind more clearly than you can. The teacher has already gone through what you're going through, and has overcome the obstacles, and has gained the fruition of the practice. Many teachers can often tell at a glance whether your practice is bright or dull. So this puts you at a great advantage if you're working with a teacher; you can avoid months, perhaps years, of wasted time.</p>
<p>[<em>Edit: I realize that I've understated the influence of a teacher here. Without a living guide to correct them, the practitioner could easily go deeper and deeper into bad habit and wrong view. The impact could not only persist through one's whole life, but could be in the range of many, and perhaps innumerable, lifetimes of wrong view and wasted effort.</em>]</p>
<p>A set course of training helps because it provides a mirror: when you deviate from the course, it is very apparent. Without clear form, and just going on your own best guess, your own preferences and blind spots control your movement, and you may not know when you've left the path because there's no feedback -- there's only your own idea.</p>
<p>I should also mention that sometimes emotional issues lead to sleepiness. We may numb out so as to avoid some of the stuff that we would otherwise become aware of in meditation, including stillness and peace. Some of us find open stillness to be the most threatening thing in the world, and with no other escape available in meditation, sleep and dream can become the security blanket.</p>
