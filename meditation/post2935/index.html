  <h1>Meditation for Letting Go of Control?</h1>

<p>Thank you for your very wonderful reply. Your aim to be more present for the people in your life is wonderful. If you keep that motivation, your meditation and spiritual practice will go well; even in difficulty you will have a direction. It's when practice becomes 'for me' that suffering and confusion increase, because correct direction is lost. So practice is for yourself and your family and all beings everywhere.</p>
<p>I like Eckhart Tolle's teaching. The Power Of Now is an important book that brought the notion of presence to many people who otherwise would not have considered it so pointedly. I think his book A New Earth is even better organized, and perhaps even more accessible. Tolle himself recommends reading and re-reading the book. If you connect well to his teaching, there's no reason you <em>have</em> to seek elsewhere. Then later you can find out how to meet Tolle in person and attend some lectures or workshops to deepen practice.</p>
<p>That is wonderful that you are supporting your wife not only with your meditation practice, but with your practical support. Yes, you need to be there with your family. But if the opportunity presents itself to meet a teacher, do some weekly sittings, or attend a retreat, you should not write it off as impossible. Talk it over with your wife, see if there's some other support that can be arranged, and so on. Deepening your practice is almost never a bad idea, and will help your whole family as long as you keep your correct compassionate direction.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I'm not hung up on achieving certain states or levels.</em></p>
<p>That's also great. Most advanced practitioners I know don't talk much (or at all, really) about states and levels. Mostly they talk about clarity. If you keep your correct direction for all beings, and keep practicing sincerely, then states and levels will take care of themselves. In between our ignorant dullness and our ultimate enlightenment there's a <em>lot</em> of territory, a <em>lot</em> of opportunity to live a clear and compassionate life, and for clarity and compassion to gradually increase. To me, it is incredibly inspiring to realize this, and to see it embodied in so many practitioners.</p>
<p>There's something to be said for just continuing with the chosen practice. Certainly one may need to check different styles to learn what's out there, but it won't do to keep shopping around; and often meditators find that the more they know the more doubt and second-guessing appear in their practice.</p>
<p>But as I said before, breath-focused practice is sometimes difficult for people who have a lot of stress or controlling habit, as their anxious states get reflected back to them in the breathing. I can convey a Zen practice to you that uses phrases along with the breath, so you won't necessarily abandon the breath practice, but you can use the phrases for support.</p>
<p>You can also tell me what practices, if any, you connected well with.</p>
<p>Many teachers recommend a combination of practices, since the various aspects of self will be trained in a more complete way, and they inform and support each other. For example, in Vajrayana Buddhism, it is considered important to train the body, speech, and mind, and not to abandon one aspect for another. So physical practice, mantra, and visualization are all used together.</p>
<p>One Zen master I trained with recommended daily bowing (prostration practice), chanting, mantra, and meditation. Together these work synergistically, supporting each other. Also, any of them can be done alone as one's main practice. Chanting is especially clarifying and healing for the heart, and trains the breathing. Mantra performed aloud also trains the breathing, and purifies one's speech; performed silently it purifies one's inner speech; and when performed throughout the day is serves as a protection from the wandering thoughts that bring negativity — you notice better and return to clarity sooner when the mind turns to anger, hopelessness, dullness, lust, confusion, or any negative state.</p>
<p>I want to recommend prostration practice to you, for a few reasons. Physical practice can really help you. At first it may seem unusual if you are used to picturing spiritual practice as only sitting still; but prostration practice has many benefits. It settles the mind and smooths the energy very quickly. It unites mental, emotional, physical, and breath aspects. It helps you settle into a clear and natural condition.</p>
<p>In many practice centers and temples, bowing is the first practice of the day, done immediately upon waking. After splashing water on the face and maybe brushing the teeth, one proceeds to the practice room for 108 bows. This gives the day a fresh start, gets the blood and breath and energy (and often sweat) moving, establishes correct direction (as you bow to the highest ideal, to your pure awakened nature for the sake of all beings), and prepares you to sit in a stable manner.</p>
<p>After bowing, it is very natural to sit. Doing that vigorous, rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath activity settles the mind, and I think it can bring you to a calmer and more natural relationship with your breathing.</p>
<p>But prostration practice can also be done as its own special practice. Many high-level practitioners go straight to prostrations when their minds start to become agitated. For example, community leaders have not only their own problems, but many responsibilities for the practical and spiritual well-being of others (as a new father you can understand some of the stresses involved); and there are many community leaders who use prostrations to quickly cut through the confusion and worry, settle and focus their minds, and develop strong <em>just do it</em> energy.</p>
<p>Even when sitting becomes impossible because the mind is too agitated, you can always do bowing practice.</p>
<p>Touching the head to the mat is a chance to put down concerns and grasping for control. Standing up is a chance to feel your own integrity and devotion. Repeatedly emptying and returning to integrity clarifies the mind. When the mind is clear, many problems disappear. <em>Difficulty</em> may still be there — there will still be things to attend to — but the problem made by thinking goes away.</p>
<p>So although you have a lot on your plate, so to speak, with good practice the mind settles, and really you find yourself with a more and more spacious and open 'plate'.</p>
<p>If you want more communication, feel free to contact me in private.</p>
