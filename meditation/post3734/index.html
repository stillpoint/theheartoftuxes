  <h1>How to stay mindful while travelling?</h1>

<p>It's completely up to you whether you are mindful or not. It doesn't depend on outside circumstances; it depends only on your awareness. Your awareness is always there, you just have to avoid trading it in. When you do find you've gone away, return.</p>
<p>As to formal sitting meditation, you may find that you greatly enjoy and have gratitude for a few quiet moments on your bed upon waking and before sleeping, or a hundred simple steps wherever you find yourself. These simple little rituals can be grounding — the constant among all the change. You stay in touch with your real home.</p>
<p>Travel seems like more change, but your everyday life is always completely changing. It's only because of thinking that the illusion of stability appears. You apply the thoughts "my house, my workplace, that guy, this tree…" and so on; but originally none of these exist. Your house and workplace are always shifting, things being moved around, different activities and energies arising in them. 'That guy' is an ever-changing stream of matter, energy, and experience. 'This tree' is never the same from moment to moment, day to day.</p>
<p>But travel shakes up that illusory stability. Therefore travel can help you relate better to reality. You have to deal more with things as they are, because you have less opportunity to presume you know. Not completely gone, but less. It's newer, fresher.</p>
<p>And you too can be newer, fresher. Nobody knows you, so you can be anything. That is also more like the reality than is the stale self-image you may carry around.</p>
<p>But travel is also a strain on that old self-image. We can't keep things together like we can at home, so either a broader, more inclusive mind-set has to operate or we start to feel broken-down. In any case, long-term travel will break things down. If you don't hold on, the breaking-down can help you become new.</p>
<p>Travel is inherently destabilizing, so stabilizing practices can be a healthy balance. Feeling your feet contacting the ground while walking is one simple but effective practice. It can take on a relaxed, open quality. Not so much effort needed. But it can keep you "standing on firm ground".</p>
<p>As you wake up and as you go to sleep, you can piece the body together. This gives your spirit a home, and re-establishes your sense of wholeness and stability. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/27p6dx/rather_then_quitting_is_this_a_better_way_to_go/ci3ic8p">I describe the practice in this post.</a></p>
<p>If it's important to you to keep in touch with your higher motivation while traveling, you might want to bring an altar or altar object with you. It's a bit of home, in both the mundane sense and the spiritual sense. If you're clever you can construct it out of items that are very light and packable, or even multi-purpose.</p>
<p>I'm fond of the little matchbox altars I make for travel. I take a small matchbox and paste a spiritual image or calligraphy to the inside. I also cut or break incense to fit the box, and add a tiny incense holder. Laid out on a bandanna, with a small cup of water or a flower as an offering, and perhaps the occasional candle purchased locally, this altar forms a focal point for the room I'm staying in, and calls up my aspiration to wake up and to offer compassion to everyone along the way.</p>
<p>In Tibet, travelers would carry altar boxes in pouches on their belts or across their bodies. Made of metal pressed into auspicious designs, housing an image of a Buddha or great teacher, and holding within them sacred objects like mantras, herbs, and relics, these items were always within reach of the traveler. Thus spirituality was not an afterthought, but something "held close".</p>
<p>In lieu of such an item, you can spread out a piece of fabric and place on it any suitable object found locally — a flower, a pebble, an icon postcard, a mirror. The object gets left behind when you move on.</p>
<p>Your regular daily rituals can also become meditative, or even formal meditations if you so desire. The first breath of the morning can be taken consciously and with devotion, offering yourself to the benefit of all as you ride on breath. Without this one first breath, you are dead. So you can think "By the grace of something greater than me, I am alive one more day. May I use this day for the benefit of all."</p>
<p>The first splash of water on your face in the morning can be a ritual cleansing, washing off your negative qualities and vowing to express your clean, fresh mind. Standing in the shower, you can receive all the blessings of enlightened beings everywhere and vow to become enlightened yourself, and shower blessings on all beings.</p>
<p>Taking food, you can take a moment to realize that this trip, and this life journey, are completely dependent upon having enough food. Realizing your dependency and the ease with which you could pass away, you can vow to live your best and to offer yourself to all other hungry, vulnerable beings.</p>
<p>In the same vein, you can create your own meditations. Going to the washroom is an often-overlooked chance to see your relationship with the world. Meeting a person for the first time can be considered a sacred moment. And so on….</p>
<p>If you apply attention and care, you can make anything into a meditation or prayer. Even just slowing down tends to bring a more meditative quality to whatever you're doing.</p>
<p>That should be more than enough to go on. Choose whatever you find appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>piecing the body together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>awakening gratitude/vow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a few minutes of meditation on your bed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100 mindful steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>awareness of feet on the ground as you walk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>altar practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making meditation of everyday rituals</p>
</li>
</ul>
