  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>It indicates a manipulative mindset. It tends to unbalance the blood-brain chemistry and it tends to promote attachment to stillness.</p>
<p>Mere stillness and comfort aren't the proper aims of meditation. They may be <em>your</em> aims, and if that's the case, knock yourself out. But in essence you are engaging in wrong relationship — trying to manipulate your bodymind in order to get a favored state, rather than learning to be present with <em>things-as-they-are</em>. It is putting your own agenda ahead of reality, which is basically egotism rather than correct meditation.</p>
<p>This approach <em>has</em> been used in traditional training. The theory is that by quickly prompting an experience of deep stillness/emptiness, the student can get an experience that provides a guiding light for the rest of the journey. It is hoped that in the silence the self dissipates. But the way it tends to play out is that the practitioner becomes tense and narrow-minded in their approach. Even teachers who develop profound levels of concentration with this approach will often have a narrow-minded or domineering side to their character.</p>
<p>Holding the breath approximates death, so it brings forth acute attention, forcing out many thoughts and experiences. This is one of the dynamics used in sophisticated paths of breath training like <em>pranayama</em> in Yoga. But in these traditional paths, the dynamic is presented within a very complete and well-regulated context, together with philosophy, motivation, and method, and overseen by a teacher. This is quite different than doing it just because it feels good or takes your mind away, like sniffing glue. If you want to pursue it, you might look into a Yoga course that includes <em>pranayama</em>, or the <em>Nei Gong</em> internal arts traditions of China.</p>
<p>It is very important to have the courage and fortitude to let go of "I want" in meditation. Attachment to stillness is a big sickness, and many fall prey to it just at the time when they are advancing in their abilities to concentrate. It is like cutting down the rose bush just as it starts to bud. Stillness is definitely an important and healing aspect of practice; but in itself it doesn't lead to awakening or to functionality in life. In correct practice we aren't looking to escape into nothingness, we are looking to <em>use</em> nothingness to be clear and to function with wisdom and compassion in everyday life. This requires us to be okay with <em>what is</em>, not to kill it or escape it.</p>
<p>There is a more balanced way of enjoying stillness through the breath. I can give a bit of instruction here, but if you want to practice really you should find a good teacher, a wise guide who has already traveled all the territory you're going through.</p>
<p>First, the attitude should be openhanded, not grasping at any state. Commit to openness. Your original nature is already complete. Nothing else has to be added from the outside. So you can open as the moment. This is the right non-manipulative attitude.</p>
<p>When watching the breath, allow all phases of it to appear naturally. Don't rush some parts and loiter in others, but allow the breath to appear as-it-is. This is a more mature approach. It is like the difference between childish romance and mature romance: the former is grasping at ideals, the latter opens to <em>what is</em> and offers loving attention to all of it.</p>
<p>As the breath turns, there are qualities you can participate in at each phase:</p>
<p>The inhalation has the quality of bringing you here. (In Hindu practice it is called <em>'soham'</em>: "I am".) You can enjoy the way inhalation brings you into yourself.</p>
<p>The turning from inhalation to exhalation has a sense of commitment, even courage — the courage to move forth and let go.</p>
<p>The exhalation has the quality of letting go and merging with boundlessness. As the personal breath goes out into the infinite world, the mind also softens and spreads and merges with the Absolute (the divine spirit).</p>
<p>In other words, the sense of self rises and sinks with the breath as well, arriving and then dissipating.</p>
<p>At the end of the exhalation is the still space. You will like this space, this emptiness. You can open to it and let it deepen in you, and at times you may even find it blissful. But when it is time for the breath to turn around you must let it go, and return with the breath.</p>
<p>If you are open and ungrasping in this process you will find that the silence deepens without having to clutch at it. The stillness at the end of the exhalation will continue beneath or behind the movement of the rest of the breath. You will begin to identify with the still Watcher for whom all coming and going happens, rather than seeking stillness as some separate and external thing.</p>
<p>Letting go of the still space is very beautiful. It expresses a faith. It is <em>okay</em> to let go; it is <em>okay</em> to return. You carry that stillness back into the world and use it, and share it.</p>
<p>So you experience the still space but you have the faith that your true nature <em>is</em> stillness; so you don't always need to grasp at the experience of it. In the background, your original still mind embraces everything: quiet can come and go, noisy can come and go, pleasant and unpleasant can come and go. All of these appear within the still space of your original nature, your Witness mind. That mind is <em>revealed</em> at the end of the outbreath, but it is not created or destroyed. So have faith in it, and let the breath turn, and let the world come and go.</p>
<p>This is a more mature approach. I recommend it, but you have to make your own choice. Good luck!</p>
