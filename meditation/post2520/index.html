  <h1>How to focus on the breath?</h1>

<p>&gt; <em>But sometimes the thoughts are too intense. They start as a gentle whisper until they hit something I really worry and start being carried away.</em></p>
<p>Eckhart Tolle said something very provocative; he said "If you wanted peace, you would have it." This is so interesting to consider, and it provides a mirror for us at those times when we feel we just <em>must</em> think about something. At those moments, we are making a deal with ourselves, a contract. We are deciding that the thinking is more important than the peace. It is not true, though; otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting down to meditate, we'd be dealing with the supposedly crucial, grave, urgent matter we're thinking about.</p>
<p>So at those moments we can use our intellect. We can recognize the decision we're making to stay with the thought, and then we can let it go. Letting go doesn't necessarily mean the thinking disappears. The train of thought may appear repeatedly, ten times or a thousand times. No matter. Only let go just now. Only return to the method just now. The method is your job.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>There's a lot of talk about don't straining oneself, but zazen is the exact opposite. They require you an exact, vert strict position, and no matter how much it hurtsâ€¦.</em></p>
<p>Different schools of Zen will teach different styles. Some (typically the Japanese Rinzai schools, along with some others) require ramrod-straight posture. Others provide guidelines but allow you to find your own way, and even allow for standing up and changing posture whenever it becomes an obstacle.</p>
<p>Both ways are correct, in that they both aim at awakening. But each way has benefits and drawbacks. Understanding the benefits, drawbacks, and ultimate aim, you can better choose the style that is most suitable for you.</p>
<p>The reason our bodies don't sit upright comfortably is because of patterns of tension already in place. When the bodymind naturally surrenders to gravity it finds its own balance, which is very calm and at ease. It is so pleasant to find this balance, although it may take quite a bit of guidance and training to arrive there not simply through fortunate happenstance.</p>
<p>For you, it sounds like stress is more of an obstacle. Some types of people do well when pushed. They build up a dense ball of will that eventually releases. Others get too distracted, and can't even get going well along the path when considerable stress is introduced. Life is stressfull; life is a struggle; so along the way training should include challenges and difficulties. It should just be in balance with where you are in your practice. Studying with a teacher and group is very helpful in this regard.</p>
<p>I would suggest just what I suggested in my earlier post: find a posture that is both relaxed and awake. Your training should build your ability to relax, disengage from attachment and stress, and return openhandedly to the present moment. Once you get the hang of letting-it-be both physically and mentally, to the point where at least you can return to a neutral state reliably, <em>then</em> you can start introducing more strict rules of posture.</p>
<p>The strict posture of course is meant to support the mind. Twists and off-kilter leans and lax areas both reflect and contribute to a mind that is not direct and in balance. But my sense is that you need to start finding your balance through relaxing rather than forcing. That will go along with the more appropriate meditative attitude in general: this moment is okay, no need to force it to be anything else.</p>
<p>I have been practicing meditation for decades, including doing many long retreats, and I also switch between cross-legged sitting on a mat and sitting upright in a chair. The main thing is to allow "just now is okay" to permeate your body and mind.</p>
<p>On another note, physical activity is a tremendously helpful and often overlooked companion to sitting meditation. Vigorous, rhythmic, whole-body-and-breath movement has a way of relaxing the bodymind and helping it find its own right setup. Bowing practice before sittings is very highly recommended. And when the mind is too agitated to even sit down to meditation, bowing is exceptionally helpful for bringing the mind down and centering it.</p>
<p>Other helpful activities may include running, biking swimming, fast walking, Taiji, Bagua circle walking, Hindu squats, chopping wood or shoveling earth or snow, and free dance. The combination of physical practice and sitting meditation is powerful. Over time, if performed in an enjoyable and relaxed fashion, the physical activity will enhance blood and energy circulation, improve brain function, and relax the stressful patterns that appear in the body.</p>
