  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>What is your path? You have to know that in order to know whether you are on the right path.</p>
<p>Why meditate? Each practice has its own aim and result, its own path, and its own context (tradition, culture, companion practices and teachings, etc.). Why choose one over another? This question clarifies your path.</p>
<p>'Highly pleasurable': is that your basis for choosing a path? If that's the main basis, perhaps recreational drugs or other activities would work much better.</p>
<p>What is the aim: Is it to feel stronger, to bolster the sense of self? In some cases this might be a necessary step; the ego could do with some bolstering. But if it's for a spiritual purpose, that bolstering had better not be let in the driver's seat to take over the whole process!</p>
<p>So each traditional path of training has <em>appropriate</em> ways of building the self, until enough stability is found by which one can move beyond the self. This is <em>not</em> territory one can navigate on one's own. The reason should be obvious, though for many it is not: the ego is utterly incapable of providing its own spiritual perspective. The ego functions as the ego — the sense of selfhood and the mediator between various parts of the mind. <em>Another</em> faculty is required to provide the view beyond the self, the view of awakening and unconditional love.</p>
<p>Traditional paths of training also each have their own way of processing emotion. Some are paths of renunciation, in which you maintain commitments of purity. Others are paths of transformation, in which both positive and negative energies are actively embraced, and ultimately realized as pure truth.</p>
<p>One thing we can take caution with is the pitfall many young people fall into, especially young men: by the nature of their character and phase of life they tend to attach to masculine qualities of power, effort, and breakthrough. This lends a lot of energy to their practice. But they tend to forget and disrespect the feminine qualities of <em>innate</em> fruitfulness, gentleness, and acceptance. As true as it is that there's much to do and a long way to go, it's also true that everything is already done and there's nowhere to go.</p>
<p>The way this pitfall often plays out is that the meditator or practitioner becomes fascinated with and attached to thrill, drama, feelings of power, and scenarios of power-seeking, and in general <em>completely misses the point</em> of openhandedness. The sense of 'my practice' and 'my goal' become all-consuming. The faith to <em>let everything be</em> is mistrusted. It is a very object-oriented, dualistic relationship with the one supposedly non-dualistic process in their life.</p>
<p>It can seem that going into the emotional and stirring <em>content</em> of mind is the courageous path. The ego, ever hungry for power and control, thinks that. But the real courage is the courage <em>not</em> to touch — the courage to face emptiness without trying to cover it, fill it, or defeat it. This is the crucial feminine side of spirituality.</p>
<p>As Lao Tzu wrote, "know the child, but keep to the Mother." That is, you should be conscious of the content of mind, the 'child' of mind; but the place where you stay and operate from should be at the unknowing, open, empty source of mind, the Mother of everything.</p>
<p>Opening the hands and not doing anything in particular takes tremendous courage that many young men find difficult to muster. They are still stuck on pursuing power, and they still distract themselves from open silence and emptiness. It is not a criticism, it is just noting a pattern. At that time of life, it's appropriate for a young man or woman to venture into many different new territories and sort of test themselves out, to understand what parts of their life are limited and what parts are not. This new self-definition is an important phase. But it shouldn't <em>take over</em> spiritual practice. It should harmonize with it.</p>
<p>If you are interested in exploring aggression and power, I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conscious dance and other embodiment practices are exceptional at bringing inner dimensions to consciousness and exploring them in safe ways. Embodiment is absolutely vital to the process of becoming a complete human, and it is glaringly lacking in our society. The ability to get out of the head and into the body is extremely valuable. And it is necessary, after all, for that potent, seething heart to <em>have a place</em>. I can't recommend embodiment practice enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some versions include Open Floor, Movement Medicine, 5Rhythms, Continuum, Biodanza, Authentic Movement, and other streams such as playback theatre and psychodrama.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traditional shamanic training also embraces strong internal energies and harnesses them toward integrity and compassion. Native American or other native shamanist paths train you to be able to enter your powerful darkness, and then return with your sanity intact, thus providing a healing bridge to inner worlds for yourself and others. Animal work, the connection between outer spirits and inner mental and emotional energies, figures prominently in most shamanic paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The meditative path that most strongly comes to mind is Vajrayana Buddhism, in which all emotions are seen as expressions of enlightenment. For example, the negative emotion of aggression is, in its original essence, actually fierce compassion — the kind of love that can penetrate through thick resistance and delusion. One is taught to unify with the divine essence of all emotions, and to naturally express one's own nature, whether gentle or fierce, insightful or faithful, embracing or active.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these paths, you should note, rely on a teacher, a course of training, and an ongoing practice relationship.</p>
