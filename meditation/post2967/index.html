  <h1>My forehead starts to hurt upon some time sitting.</h1>

<p>&gt;Well, it's not real pain, but some "contraction" there, like I was trying to push my forehead forwards.</p>
<p>&gt;And it relates to how much I've been concentrating on my breath. The more focused I am, the more annoying is that sensation.</p>
<p>&gt;Am I trying too hard or something like that?</p>
<p>There are many possible causes. It often takes some investigative work to understand the pattern.</p>
<p>You already are aware of a cause-effect relationship. So when you say â€œthe more focused I am...", how do you identify 'focus'? Do you associate a feeling that appears, or something you're trying to do? Focus doesn't necessarily feel like anything in particular.</p>
<p>Very often in our attempt to harness our resources toward concentration we create tension. The very sense of gathering may also be involved in gathering up the flesh and bones and muscles of the body. A band or basket of tension can appear in the front of the chest and neck and arms as one seeks to <em>gather</em> mental energy, or leans out to find the object of focus. Or tension can build in the back, shoulders, and neck from the mental burden one has unconsciously taken on. The muscles of the neck connect to the scalp, and both physically and energetically this tension can be transmitted over the head to the brow. It is exacerbated with eye strain that comes with the dualistic effort to focus and find the object of concentration that one thinks of as 'outside'. Concern, consternation, seriousness, worry, and anger are all expressed through the brow and forehead (as well as other areas), and play into the tension that may appear there.</p>
<p>These patterns of relating to the method share a dualistic nature: the object of concentration is related to as something outside that one has to seek, grasp, and hold. Effort and emotional content increase the dualistic effect and mounting tension, and it can become a vicious circle: the more tension is experienced, the less integral and more difficult the whole process seems.</p>
<p>So in terms of approach, starting from a place of openness and equanimity is key. Meditation should not be conceived of as a hunt. The object of focus is not originally outside of you; your experience of it is already immediate, direct, intimate, whether it's a circle of color, a repeated phrase, or the sensation of breath. So this non-grasping relationship is important.</p>
<p>Posture can also greatly influence comfort, and most often the posture one takes in some way reflects and increases whatever mental approach one has. A lax attitude goes along with lax posture, and both increase each other, and that becomes the experienced reality. Or a grasping attitude is reflected in the body as well, and mind and body conspire to encapsulate the meditator and make it seem like reality is forever <em>outside</em> and that Herculean effort is necessary to reach it. And there are of course many subtle individual variations.</p>
<p>So the second point of practice (after starting with an awake but non-grasping attitude) is to achieve a neutral posture. First establish a firm base that can be maintained with relative ease. That is, <em>you</em> don't have to struggle to maintain the base by pushing your knees down or forcing your pelvis into a certain angle or whatever. The base should be both firm and easy, because it is really what the ease of the rest of the body is founded upon. When the base is solid, the rest of the body can stack upon it naturally; but any tension already present in the base will find its way into the rest of the posture, even all the way up to the head.</p>
<p>Once the posture has been found, you may check that the head is actually sitting in a neutral way upon the spine, and not jutting forward or pulled back. Our modern sedentary life and work tend to pull the shoulders and head forward from their most functional positions. And the head is heavy! If it's forward of its support, the head will require muscle tension to hold it, which leads to pain in the neck that is also transmitted to the head.</p>
<p>For this reason, the instruction is often given to pull the chin back. This is bad, or at least incomplete, instruction. Pulling the chin back without <em>feeling</em> the neutral position of the head very often destroys the supportive curve of the neck, again creating tension and pain. Posture should only be based on an image or an idea in the loosest sense; your <em>feeling</em> should guide you as to the best relationships between bodyparts.</p>
<p>In some Zen traditions the instruction is to rock back and forth when you take your seat. This is a way of finding center, of feeling how your body stacks up on itself, among other things. You can rock forward and back, and also side to side. Also note whether you are holding your head in a forward jutting position or a tense pulled-back position. The feeling should be of a free skull balanced easily on top of the spine, with the face facing forward (not tipped down or up).</p>
<p>Breath should be natural in meditation, neither held nor forced. This also goes along with one's mental approach, whether it's grasping or avoiding or dull, or ideally present and neutral. If the breath is out of balance many sensations can appear anywhere in the body, and strange mental images and other phenomena can appear as well. These are all addressed by letting go of everything and returning to neutral presence and neutral breath -- just available breath, neither forced nor held back.</p>
<p>In terms of energetics, there is a major circulatory pathway traveling through the brow. The energy flows up along the spine, through the crown and front of the skull, through the palate of the mouth, the tongue, and the throat, and down the front of the torso, completing the circuit at the perineum and tailbone. In case you haven't received the instruction already, the tongue should lightly contact the palate just behind the teeth, as this connects the circuit of flow. If it's not connected there could be some unnecessary backlog. (Some yogic systems are very specific about where to place the tongue, but for most of us it is sufficient to let it lightly rest behind the teeth or in the groove behind the hard palate.)</p>
<p>Different systems of energetics have slightly different teachings about the structures and circulations of energy, but in general open flow is understood to be beneficial and comfortable. If there is either a relative blockage (a 'traffic jam') of flow or a new stronger flow through an existing bottleneck, this can be experienced as tension or pain. Posture of mind and body influence the flow of energy. Two areas of posture to be mindful of are the sacrum and the area at the back ridge of the skull, as both of these are places where energy can either get pumped along its course or blocked up. If the lower back is tight or if the head is held awkwardly upon the neck the flow can be diminished. After meditation it can be helpful to massage or tap the soft spots between the muscles of the neck and the base of the skull at back (called 'beating the heavenly drum' in Taoist yogic practice), and also the lower back/sacrum. (As an experiment, if you move these areas effortlessly you might feel the effects of a more open flow, and you may even experience a direct connection to your forehead.)</p>
<p>Sensations in the forehead during meditation can also be related to a sort of pool of energy there. The terms <em>third eye</em>, <em>sixth chakra</em>, and <em>upper dantien</em> are often tossed around in these discussions, but without direct experience they don't really mean much, other than being fancy and exotic. Watch a stream of water, and you can understand flow much better than by just collecting fancy words; you can see that there may be a whirlpool, but the whirlpool has no existence of its own, independent of the water swirling around.</p>
<p>In any case, yes, there may be energetic openings associated with meditation, but by far more common is the experience of blockage. Spiritual flow is cool, calm, and empty. The more common experiences of itching, pressure, vibration, heat, or fullness are associated with what one teacher calls 'qi effect', which is just a local experience of energy because the flow is not quite as smooth there or because one is a bit more sensitive in that area or for some reason brings attention there habitually.</p>
<p>Most of us live 'up in our heads', so the common result is that our energy will get relatively blocked up there. And when we consciously settle and let the energy start to flow, that backlog might feel like something. It is nothing special, and nothing to be manipulated. Just leave it, relax, and return to non-grasping practice. The points of practice mentioned above, along with a proper method, will take care of almost all such phenomena.</p>
