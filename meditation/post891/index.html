  <h1>TheHeartofTuxes</h1>

<p>An excerpt from my longer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/393rc9/i_need_a_little_guidance_i_cant_be_more_involved/cs07ovt">previous post:</a></p>
<p>&gt; How you arise in the morning tends to shape your day. A conscious practice for a moment or a minute as you awaken can have lasting effect. As you shape your days, you shape your life; as your days go, so goes your life.
&gt; 
&gt; One practice is to <strong>embrace the Buddha</strong> upon first waking. As soon as you become conscious, even before opening your eyes, you can turn your mind and heart toward the uplifting, compassionate, enlightening aspect of the universe, and intentionally welcome it in. You can use your breath to receive the blessing of the day; you can open your arms in a hug and embrace the universal Buddha -- whatever is most meaningful to you.
&gt; 
&gt; Another possible waking practice is <strong>piecing the body together in awareness</strong>. Bring awareness to your hands, then add your feet, then move the awareness inward to include the limbs and then the whole body. You can spend maybe a minute or so bringing yourself into your body after drifting in sleep all night. The effect is to start from a place of stability, groundedness, presence -- as opposed to being taken over by the stream of thinking that appears. It makes the difference between starting the day as a conscious, embodied person, versus an automation or zombie, still controlled by the dream that has extended into daytime.
&gt; 
&gt; Piecing the body together is a quick practice that can be done also when settling in to sleep, or at any time when you want to be more embodied and stable.
&gt; 
&gt; Another very good morning practice as soon as you wake is <strong>morning vow and altar practice</strong>: immediately jump up and splash cold water on your face, then go to your altar or clear corner, light a candle, voice a vow to honor your awakened nature, and take a few conscious breaths. It is not fancy, but it is a complete and powerful practice: positive intention and positive action are both there, and Dharmic clarity is experienced in many ways in a short period of time: through touch (the cold water), vision (the light of the candle), archetypal action (lighting the candle), intention (feeling the sincere vow), voice (voicing the vow), and breath (taking the conscious breaths). The main thing is to be sincere.
&gt; 
&gt; <strong>Offering candle light, incense, or clear water</strong> are traditional devotional practices that not only train the concentration in a very delightful way, but connect one's mind and heart deeply to the awakening and blessings of enlightened beings (which are the same awakening and blessings of your own true nature). If at any time you want to deepen your connection to Dharma you can do even a single act of offering. And any time you have the opportunity you can do dozens, hundreds, or thousands of offerings. In fact, you don't <em>need</em> the physical objects if you can visualize offering light, fragrance, or clear water to the enlightened ones, which means you can be making offerings standing in line at the store, or riding the subway, or sitting down to coffee.
&gt; 
&gt; These are all very good, profound practices that don't take much time. Do any or all, as you choose. You can spare five minutes in the morning. If you can't, then wake up five minutes earlier; it won't detract from your sleep, and it will gather great merit for you.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/34vpu2/first_thing_in_the_morning/cqysxsn">previous post,</a> in its entirety:</p>
<p>&gt; Unless you are committed to a certain form you can choose for yourself. There are, though, important benefits to practicing immediately upon waking. For one, the mind is in an ideal threshold consciousness (between sleep and waking), where the deep relaxation of sleep and its connection to the unconscious can be encountered with awareness. There are many other issues of energy and commitment that come into play as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The schedule at many residential meditation centers requires practice before taking any food. For a classic example, in a Zen monastery you may wake at 3am, splash water on your face, do 108 bows, do at least two rounds of sitting with walking meditation in between, walk to another building in the complex, do a full chanting service, and do a period of work practice as the sun is rising, before breakfast is even served. (Source: I've practiced at such a monastery.)
&gt; 
&gt; If you plan to fall asleep, you're already defeating yourself. If you make sleepiness the thing that's going to shut you down and keep you from practice, you're giving yourself over to attachment to sleep (one of the 5 Attachments: sleep, food, sex, money, and fame).
&gt; 
&gt; Another of the important benefits of early morning and late night practice is that you will often have to directly face your sleepiness. This allows you to train in unconditionality — the motivation and effort to wake up beyond sleepiness, and even beyond sleep. Eventually you can have lucid awareness in your waking life as well as in sleep; thus you can see past the veil of appearance, you can move beyond the dream of life.
&gt; 
&gt; But if you are left to your own devices, based on your sense of things or based on your preference, you may never even conceive that practice while sleepy might have a beneficial and even a vital importance. It is another example of why the common person, from their state of ignorance, is not in a good position to design their own course of meditation.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are just dabbling in meditation, there is no problem with doing it later in the morning. It can be of benefit at any time. If your aim is to move beyond your mind habit and get liberation, you almost certainly need to submit to the guidance of a good teacher, and to a form and schedule of training within a tradition.</p>

<p>Your posture should be balanced between alertness and relaxation. Too tight, and the body will become exhausted and the mind will resist; too lax, and the body will slump and the mind will wander and doze. So posture should be upright and settled. And the attitude should be present, alert, and settled. Any agenda, any grasping or achieving must be let go of, as it will keep you in a state of duality that invites these kinds of patterns, besides just being wrong meditation.</p>
<p>The eyes should be open, unless there is direct instruction from a teacher that they should be closed for a specific purpose (such as visualization). The common and traditional way is to have the eyes half-opened, as you see displayed in statues of the Buddha.</p>
<p>When drowsiness appears, you can raise the line of sight from angled slightly downward toward the floor, to more straight ahead. Lifting the eyes tends to lift the energy.</p>
<p>When drowsiness or drifting appears, you can emphasize the inhalation as the vehicle of alertness. Bring yourself <em>here</em> with the in-breath. (The outbreath should be in balance, as the vehicle of rest; and the pause at the end of the breath should also be in balance, as it connects you to the spaciousness of mind — as breath moves into the space of the world, so you rest in the open and clear space of your true mind.)</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
