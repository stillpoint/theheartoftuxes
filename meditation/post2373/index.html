  <h1>Consistently meditating for 2+ years. How to move to next level?</h1>

<p>&gt;Left to our own devices, our personal proclivities (our likes and dislikes) tend to win often enough to prevent uprooting obstacles to samadhi.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good points in your inquiry, and a lot of issues to consider. You pulled out the phrase that is quite pivotal for seekers in your situation, and for practitioners at all but the highest levels (and maybe even then). "I want" often wins, and it often wins in spectacular fashion, disrupting one's efforts before one is even conscious of the disruption.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm leery of couching this in terms of a battle, so instead of "win", let's say that we are often diverted by choices and habits based on an ingrained view of who we are and what we need. So having a teacher can be of great value:</p>
<ul>
<li>The teacher provides a mere outside perspective and acts as a witness (which any spiritual friend could also provide), creating a lifeline out of self-involved processes.</li>
<li>The teacher backs this perspective up with experience and wisdom. The experience and wisdom may vary and may be imperfect, but presumably it is there to help guide you.</li>
<li>The teacher (a good one) can go beyond ego, thus leading you and your process out of ego-driven or ego-shrouded territory.</li>
<li>The teacher provides a continuous living example not only of what may be required, but of what is <em>possible</em>. The resulting nourishment of your aspiration is inestimable, and of inestimable worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually the last thing we want is to seek out someone to check our behavior. We want free rein! We want to do things our way, comfortably, and in our own time. In part, this is correct — you have to respect your own situation, and you are your own primary teacher and guide. But the other side is that "I want" and "my way" are not free; they are trapped in self-concern, mired in <em>samsara</em>. We are enslaved by "my way", following it around and around to an ideal situation that never comes. So if we want <em>real</em> freedom, we have to go beyond "I want" and "my way".</p>
<p>It is very helpful to understand that a practice aiming at freedom from the self-image and its patterns will <em>feel</em>, to that self-image, like oppression. The egocentric part of us will want no part of this discipline; but the soul — the living, awakening part of us — loves it and needs it! Zen Master Dogen said that if practice doesn't feel like something is being forced upon you it's not deep. That is, it doesn't challenge the old stuck patterns.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>I was curious about your response, how essential is a teacher in the beginning and would it be possible to equivalently hurt myself within a long-term independent practice?</em></p>
<p>If you can find a teacher, that's great. But even the process of seeking out a teacher can be helpful. There is no rule; everyone unfolds in their own unique way. Some find a teacher straight off, and others go here and there and don't find a teacher (<em>their</em> teacher) for many years. But in both cases it may be the best outcome, or a necessary one. There's a gain and loss to every approach.</p>
<p>Seeking out a teacher will be an embodiment for you as you act upon your aspiration. Taking positive action helps establish your positive aim. The short term results don't matter so much; but the pure and energetic <em>trying</em> is wonderful. This is how you help yourself.</p>
<p>Seeking out a teacher will also bring you into contact with all those issues mentioned, and more. So you will have to consider why one way is better than another, and you will have to test it out for yourself. Then you will get your own wisdom, which is a million times better than what anyone here can tell you. (Then maybe you can come on Reddit and help others with your wisdom.)</p>
<p>But if you don't find a teacher in the next while, that is also fine. What matters is your motivation and your effort.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, proper motive. Why meditate? What is the best purpose you can come up with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, proper method. Choose a practice clearly, learn it well, and try, try, try. Let the trying be untouched by like and dislike. Moment to moment keep your correct center, which means you will relate appropriately to the moment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers, sincere spiritual friends, a supportive environment and schedule will all help. But these are also all not necessary if you have clear and strong aspiration. And clear and strong aspiration comes from understanding the first point that I spoke of: Why do meditation? What is the purpose of meditation? In the final analysis, this means what is the purpose of any effort or choice you make in life?</p>
<p>When you connect to the aspiration that is already moving in you, feed it and grow it and let it unfold through you.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&gt;<em>Could coming back to this sub or some other areas on the internet be beneficial at all? I would still have to research my town, but I'm skeptical of finding a good teacher ...</em>
&gt;<em>I just worry about Western influences that may actually teach against what is good, considering how I've viewed our society's general take on yoga.</em></p>
<p>When you get clear on your own purpose, your own direction, you will be able to distinguish better between good and bad teaching. But you will need to break out of the shell and interact in order to find out. When you connect with your sincere aspiration, it will be clear to you that the risks (of dealing with bad teaching, personal setbacks, or general bullshit) are worth it. But that is something you need to find for yourself; it's not something I or someone else can give to you.</p>
<p>You may find a good teacher, you may find a bad teacher. If your effort is pure, not depending on like and dislike or on having any particular situation, then even a bad teacher will be a good teacher for you. You will be able to have compassion for their human failings and you will be able to find your way through (and maybe even help the teacher become a better teacher).</p>
<p>I share your disappointment with the watering-down and obfuscation of yoga and other profound traditions. So let's vow to maintain the highest standards ourselves. We can't determine what others will do, but we can make a pure effort ourselves.</p>
<p>So... do you want to try, despite your thinking mind's scepticism? <em>Something</em> in you wants to try, no matter what.</p>
<p>If you want suggestions for groups, centers, and teachers (which may at least provide further leads to follow up), I or others here might provide some info. I very strongly advise that Reddit is <em>not</em> a good place to get advice on practice or meditation. I mean to say, there are a few clear voices, but they are mixed in with a lot of posing and opinion and speculation and general shallow banter, and until you have your own clarity and experience it will sometimes be hard to tell the difference between good advice and advice that sounds good.</p>
<p>I started meditating at a young age, and met teachers early on in life; but I also looked around quite energetically for a dozen years or so before finding the teacher who I connected with deeply. And I will say — I will sing from the rooftops — that not only were those 12 years of searching worth it, but a lifetime of effort would have been worth it!</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear what you come up with in looking into your aim and aspiration. What is it that you sincerely, deeply want or need or are willing to offer? I believe it will all unfold for you from this question (which may be a lifelong question). And if I can help further, let me know.</p>
