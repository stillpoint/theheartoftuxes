  <h1>Meditation vs Spirituality?</h1>

<p>Good question! Even many people who study spirituality haven't looked into this question beyond the surface.</p>
<p>There are lots of different opinions about what spirituality is, and the word is used in lots of different ways. Some think it refers to anything beyond the ordinary or unexplainable. Some think it has to do with "spirits", ghosts, and voices from other dimensions. Some equate spirituality with religion — either religious activity or religious feeling. And there are many more definitions and also many more vague and undefined ideas about spirituality.</p>
<p>To me, the true meaning of spirituality points to the place where your question came from. The one who seeks to understand life, the one at the center of all actions and experiences — the most central part of <em>you</em>: that is what spirituality is about.</p>
<p>So it means finding out who or what you really are, and what is the true nature of this life; and then using that wisdom to help yourself and all others.</p>
<p>You say that you understand how meditation might be helpful, in that it could help you relax and enjoy life. Maybe it helps you focus or improves your concentration so that you can be better at work or sports or other pursuits. Traditionally, that has been called "outside path" meditation. This is meditation that serves your idea of who you are and what you should be doing. But if you look more deeply into who you are, the purpose of meditation — and the purpose of life — may change dramatically for you.</p>
<p>Our common view is that the world is a collection of objects, and that we are also objects (people) in this big group. We see ourselves as small individuals inside a shell of skin, and we think that our minds are inside the skin and the world is outside. But if you look more closely at the world, you will see that the boundaries between "things" are never absolute — there is always communication, blending, give-and-take. Also, what we think of as stable, unchanging things are always, always changing, changing, changing. Things appear when conditions come together, and they last for a while as their form changes (ages, decays, and so on), and then they disperse into parts that move off into other forms. This is true of clouds and rivers and trees and mountains, and it is also true of animal bodies and thoughts and feelings: things are never stable, but always come together, change, and disperse. Only our <em>thinking</em> makes a world of things, because it names everything. We pay more attention to the names of things than we do to what's really going on.</p>
<p>You are not your name, and you are not your body. Also, you are not your possessions, nor your relationships, nor your opinions, nor your history, nor your emotions or dreams or thoughts. All of these things <em>belong</em> to you, in a sense, but they are not you.</p>
<p>For instance, you say "this is my home" just as easily as you say "this is my body" or "this is my opinion". Anything you can point to as "my" something is what <em>belongs</em> to you; it is not you. So what <em>is</em> at the center of all of these things? What sees, what hears? From where did your question arise? This is the central question of spirituality. Sometimes it is called the "Big Question".</p>
<p>There is no activity more practical than clarifying the Big Question. Before it is clarified, our efforts serve our <em>idea</em> of who we are, our illusion of selfhood. After it is clarified, then we can live a truly clear, helpful, meaningful life.</p>
<p>At first, you think that you are a separate individual in a vast universe, and maybe you meditate to help that individual gain a little power, a little foothold. But really your mind includes the universe. The universe is in your mind, not the other way around. Everything that you are aware of, at every level of awareness, happens within the space of your mind. One could say that mind is the substance that everything is made of. Sometimes people get hints of this when they see a great natural vista, when they gaze into the eyes of a wild animal or a baby, or when they fall deeply in love. At such times, a feeling of oneness may appear. But spirituality is not about feeling. Feeling is only a side product. Spirituality means directly perceiving, directly grasping your true self and the true nature of the world.</p>
<p>Meditation is the way to this direct perceiving. When the mind is quiet enough, it reflects true nature clearly, like a mirror or like the surface of a calm lake. The common person's mind is a big hubbub, tossing about and distracting itself and chasing after this and that. This mind can't clearly experience life; it only (or mostly) experiences its own thinking illusion. So we live in our thinking world most of the time, rather than the real world, the momentary world.</p>
<p>Meditation helps us return to the real, momentary world. We put down our opinion and idea, we let go of the chatter and distraction, and allow reality to appear on its own. We don't try to interfere or hold on to anything, we just watch. Soon, we start to see the difference between our idea and the way things really are.</p>
<p>Scientists know that between atomic particles there is space, and even within atomic particles there is space. At that level, there is nothing you can hold on to or point to as something fixed and lasting. The deeper you look, the deeper it goes, with more and more space appearing. We only have <em>names</em> for movements, relationships, and probabilities, so we can talk about them; but those names don't refer to anything solid. It is all very spacious, very empty, very fluid.</p>
<p>In Vipassana (one type of meditation practice) one brings calm and stable attention to one's own experience of the body. One finds that the idea and word for "hand", for instance, really don't encapsulate one's true experience of "hand". Instead, what appears in the awareness is: shifting, buzzing, bubbling... openness, expansion, nothingness... and thousands of other ever-changing sensations that are difficult to name. Like the scientist, the Vipassana practitioner finds that spaciousness seems to be ever-present, and that forms just appear and disappear within that space. Ultimately, one finds that one's mind — the watcher behind it all — is the space within which all phenomena appear. This is not a theory, but something that can be experienced directly and unmistakeably.</p>
<p>Other forms of meditation may arrive at the same direct perception through different methods. But take care: many so-called meditations do <em>not</em> lead to insight about true nature; instead, they may seek special states of mind or special feelings. As enticing as they may be, these practices can't help you to be free of the illusion of self that causes your suffering. You should be aware of the difference between methods and paths.</p>
<p>In Traditional Chinese Medicine, "spirit" is considered one of our precious treasures. It is the faculty of presence, the ability to be here and to be awake and aware. "Spirit" is easy to see: someone with a lot of "spirit" has very bright eyes, and a palpable presence. There is a sense that they are <em>here</em> and they are <em>ready</em>. This "spirit" is no different from what I have talked about above; it is just the name Chinese Medicine gives for the way that true nature, that mind, appears in a person's body, activity, and demeanor.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> that? What <em>is</em> the presence, the awareness at the center of your experience this very moment?</p>
